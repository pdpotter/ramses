MR. LEPPERT: Keith, one thing before we
18 get started, because I don't want to interrupt
19 your deposition via phone, is it okay if one
20 objection for the Morris counsel also counts for
21 R.J. Reynolds?
22
MR. MITNIK: Yes, sir.
23
MR. LEPPERT: All right. Sounds good.
0008
1 EXAMINATION BY MR. MITNIK:
2 Q. Would you state your name, please?
3 A. David T. Beito.
4 Q. And what is your profession?
5 A. I'm a history professor at The University
6 of Alabama.
7 Q. How is it that you came to be involved in
8 this case?
9 A. Well, back in 2008, I expressed an interest
10 in doing this kind of work to a friend who was a
11 witness for RJR, historical witness. I was
12 interviewed by them and have been doing it ever
13 since. Then in this particular case was in
14 September, I was asked if I would be interested
15 in being a consultant in this case, and I said I
16 would.
17 Q. All right. And who was the person that you
18 expressed an interest to?
19 A. In the original work?
20 Q. Yes.
21 A. It was Christine Lawson. She's the person
22 at RJR. And the friend of mine was in my
23 department, his name is Jeff -- Robert Jeff
0009
1 Norrell, and he's been an expert witness for many
2 years for RJR.
3 Q. Okay. How did you hear about the potential
4 work doing this type of work for RJR? How did
5 you hear about it in the first place?
6 A. Just in conversations, over lunch and so
7 forth, with Mr. Norrell, Professor Norrell.
8 Q. And was there a discussion between you and
9 him that there might be room for somebody else to
10 do the same kind of work?
11 A. That's right, yes.
12 Q. Did he bring that subject up, that, "Hey,
13 they're looking for someone else that may be
14 willing to do this type of work"?
15 A. I think I might have brought it up, because
16 it sounded like interesting work.
17 Q. What sounded interesting about it?
18 A. Historical research, biographical research.
19 That's what I was doing at the time. I was
20 writing a biography.
21 Q. Did you have any discussions with Mr.
22 Norrell about how much he was paid for the work?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 A. I don't remember if we had a discussion
0010
1 about that specifically. We might have.
2 Q. Was one of your interests in this is that
3 it could be an additional source of income for
4 you?
5 A. Certainly. But it sounded like interesting
6 work, and I was sympathetic to what he was doing.
7 I felt good about doing this kind of work, and I
8 felt that my talents were suited to do this kind
9 of work.
10 Q. And what do you mean by "sympathetic"?
11 A. I am someone who believes very much in the
12 idea of personal responsibility, personal agency,
13 and I thought it was consistent with those ideas.
14 Q. In other words, "sympathetic" meaning that
15 you felt the cause of defending a cigarette
16 company was valid?
17
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
18 A. Well, I'm a historian, and I take where the
19 sources lead me. I've just written a biography
20 of a civil rights leader. Certainly, there were
21 things about him that I admired, but when I do my
22 writing, it's works and all. I try to look at
23 all sides and try to be fair.
0011
1 Q. You try to look at all sides, works and
2 all?
3 A. Uh-huh.
4 Q. Works and all, and try to be fair?
5 A. Try to tell the whole picture, if I can.
6 Q. We'll come back to that. Let me go back to
7 where I left off. When I asked you to define
8 what you meant by sympathetic, you said you
9 believe in personal responsibility. What did you
10 mean?
11 A. I believe that when people are adults, that
12 they are responsible for their own actions.
13 Q. What did that have to do with you being
14 sympathetic to the RJR side of the case?
15
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
16 A. It's not RJR's side of the case. I'm
17 sympathetic to the idea that individuals are
18 responsible for their decisions. Individuals are
19 free agents.
20 Q. I understand that. What has that got to do
21 with sympathetic for the work that Mr. Norrell
22 was doing?
23
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
0012
1 A. Well, I'm someone who believes that people,
2 as I said, are responsible individuals, adults,
3 that they're capable of choosing, and they should
4 be held responsible. So I would say, you know,
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 if somebody chooses a particular habit or chooses
6 to smoke or chooses not to smoke, I think those
7 are matters of individual choice. That's just a
8 personal belief. But as a historian, I take
9 where the facts lead me.
10 Q. So under this definition of sympathetic,
11 are you saying that you really believe that the
12 people that choose to smoke ought to take
13 personal responsibility and really shouldn't be
14 able to sue the cigarette company?
15
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
16 A. I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know the
17 legalities of the situation. But I think people
18 choose to smoke. Yes, I think they choose to
19 smoke, they choose not to smoke. Millions have
20 done so.
21 Q. And because of that, you felt sympathetic
22 to the work that Mr. Norrell was doing?
23
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
0013
1 Q. Right?
2 A. I felt sympathetic to the idea that people
3 should be responsible, and this work would be
4 consistent with that idea.
5 Q. How would it be consistent with that idea?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 A. Well, again, I'm giving you a personal
8 opinion here, a general opinion; but I think if
9 somebody smokes, and that is a choice, and they
10 can make the choice not to smoke. It may be a
11 difficult choice, but a lot of choices in life
12 are difficult.
13 Q. Yes, I understand that. Madam Court
14 Reporter, can you read back his answer to the
15 last question, please?
16
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
17 portion of the testimony was read back by the
18 court reporter.)
19 Q. My question is, why would this work be
20 consistent with that idea?
21
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
22 A. Because I think that the people bringing
23 cases, my general impression -- again, I'm going
0014
1 to take where the evidence leads me -- is that
2 they have a choice. They can quit or they can
3 continue. And they've had that choice. People
4 are free individuals, they have agency, and I
5 think that applies to the American population
6 unless you're somebody that's injured in an
7 accident or something like that, is brain-damaged
8 or something like that.
9 Q. I understand. You keep telling me your
10 view on personal responsibility and choices, but
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 what I'm trying to be specific about is, you said
12 that that was why -- because of those feelings of
13 yours, that was why you felt those feelings would
14 be consistent with this work. What about having
15 those feelings would make it consistent with
16 doing this type of work?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
18 A. Again, I'm going to go where the evidence
19 leads me. And if the evidence leads me in a
20 different direction, you know, I'm going to
21 respect that evidence. But in a general sense,
22 this is what I believe about human nature; that
23 smokers make choices like everybody else, and
0015
1 they can make choices to smoke or they can make
2 choices not to smoke.
3 Q. I understand. I've heard you each time
4 you've said it. The part I'm missing is, what
5 about those personal -- you said on one hand,
6 "I'm going to go where the evidence takes me."
7 A. Right.
8 Q. You said on the other hand, "I have these
9 personal feelings."
10 A. Right.
11 Q. You said one other statement that I would
12 like an answer to, which is, those personal
13 feelings you felt were consistent with the idea
14 of doing this work?
15 A. That's right.
16 Q. Why are those personal feelings, quote,
17 "consistent with doing this type of work"?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
19 A. Well, I see all sorts of historical topics
20 where I have a gut feeling about something and
21 the evidence leads me in a different direction.
22 So that could happen in this case. But I'm
23 saying as a general belief, I've found over and
0016
1 over again that people are capable of making
2 individual decisions to smoke or not to smoke.
3 Q. Put it this way. Are you saying that when
4 you feel that those feelings would be consistent
5 with the idea of doing this work, that you
6 believe in the cause of defending the smoker
7 suit?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, misstates
9 testimony.
10 A. I believe in the cause of going where the
11 evidence leads me. Certainly, we all come to
12 work and life, we take cases because in a general
13 sense we have sort of feelings about certain
14 preconceptions. But I do that in my historical
15 research, and often the evidence leads me in a
16 different direction, and conceivably the evidence
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 could do in these cases. So I have certain
18 preconceptions. Everybody does, I think.
19 Q. What I'm trying to get at is, your
20 preconception that you've referred to as having
21 those feelings that would be consistent with
22 doing this work, is that you believe in the cause
23 of the cigarette company defending itself against
0017
1 the smoker because the smoker had a choice.
2 That's a personal feeling of yours; am I correct?
3
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
4 A. Personal feeling is that the smoker has a
5 choice. That's the basis of that feeling.
6 They're adults, they have choices.
7 Q. I got that. And we can say it a hundred
8 more times and I'll still have it, I hear you.
9 But you said something that I'm trying to get to
10 the bottom of. And that is, you said that you
11 were sympathetic about the work that Mr. Norrell
12 was doing. And when I asked you to explain what
13 you meant, you said that you would feel -- that
14 your personal feelings about choice and
15 responsibility were consistent with the idea of
16 doing this work. What about those feelings makes
17 it consistent with doing this type of work?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, asked and
19 answered.
20 A. Because I believe --
21 Q. Let me ask the question. What about the
22 feelings that you believe that personal
23 responsibility and choice are consistent with the
0018
1 idea of doing this work?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
3 A. Again, I believe the motive, the belief is
4 that, you know, as a general proposition --
5 again, there could always be exceptions -- that
6 individuals are a free agency, and they can
7 choose to smoke or not to smoke. That's my
8 answer.
9 Q. What about that feeling is consistent with
10 the idea of doing this work?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, asked and
12 answered.
13 A. Again, as -- again, an individual case
14 might push me in a different direction. But as a
15 general proposition, individuals, including
16 individuals that would assert that they did not
17 have a choice, people have choices. People can
18 choose to smoke or not to smoke. Again, there
19 could be exceptions to that. I'm perfectly
20 willing to concede that.
21 Q. I'm going to try one more time, and then
22 I'll ask the court reporter to mark this series
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 of questions because I'm not getting an answer.
0019
1 My question is, you have clearly said over and
2 over and over you have a personal belief that
3 people have personal responsibility and they have
4 a choice in whether they smoke or not. It may be
5 hard, but they have a choice in that.
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. The answer to the question I'm about to ask
8 by repeating that feeling doesn't answer the
9 question. The question includes that feeling.
10 My question is, given your feelings that you've
11 expressed here that people have a personal choice
12 and they can quit, and they should take personal
13 responsibility, what about those feelings makes
14 you feel this type of work would be consistent
15 with those feelings?
16
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
17 A. Again, to the extent that it would involve
18 issues of personal responsibility. I am
19 sympathetic to the general proposition that
20 people are free agents and can choose. And
21 again, I'll take where the facts lead me. The
22 facts may lead me in a different direction in a
23 particular case.
0020
1 Q. When you said your feelings --
2 A. I'm not interested in defending a tobacco
3 company. I'm interested in accuracy, and that's
4 what I -- that's sort of my hidden vow as a
5 historian, I guess you could say.
6 Q. When you said that those feelings of yours
7 were consistent with the idea of this work, what
8 did you mean by the word "consistent"?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
10 A. Again, that individuals can freely choose
11 whether to smoke or not to smoke.
12 Q. No. What does the word "consistent" in
13 that sentence mean? Define "consistent" when you
14 said that your feelings would be consistent with
15 the idea of this kind of work. What did you mean
16 by the word "consistent"? Define "consistent."
17
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
18 A. I mean you have individuals bringing cases.
19 This is a general feeling that I have about
20 individuals. There could be exceptions; that
21 individuals, including those individuals, are
22 free actors. They can freely choose.
23 Q. So your personal feeling is that -- is
0021
1 against a lawsuit where they're receiving
2 compensation. Is that fair?
3
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, misstates
4 testimony.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 A. Again, if the facts lead me in a different
6 direction. You know, I'm going to go where the
7 facts lead me.
8 Q. I didn't ask you if you're going to go
9 where the facts lead you. I'm asking you not as
10 a historian. Your personal feeling is you are
11 against these smokers' suits?
12
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, misstates
13 testimony.
14 A. I've got all sorts of personal feelings,
15 but you rapidly discover when you're doing
16 history that the facts sometimes contradict what
17 you think happened. And that could be true in
18 this case. And I'm going to treat it like I
19 would any other historical kind of research.
20 Q. Can you answer my question? Is that a
21 personal feeling of yours, regardless of whether
22 you can put it aside, that you don't believe in
23 smokers suing, in general, cigarette companies?
0022
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a lawyer, I'm an
3 expert.
4 Q. I'm going to ask this one more time, then
5 I'm going to go back to the other one, and then
6 we'll mark all of them. If need be, I'm going to
7 move to strike this witness. This is ridiculous
8 that we've spent this much time on a very
9 straight-up question. When you said -- strike
10 that. When you said that you were sympathetic to
11 the work Mr. Norrell was doing, and I followed up
12 and asked you what you meant and you said that
13 your personal feelings regarding personal choice
14 would be consistent with the idea of doing that
15 work, did you mean that your feelings were
16 consistent because you personally don't believe
17 in a smoker suing a cigarette company for
18 injuries because he has a choice?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
20 Q. Is that what you meant?
21
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
22 mischaracterizes testimony.
23 A. I'm not a lawyer. You know, the legalities
0023
1 whether you can sue or not sue, people sue for
2 all sorts of reasons. You know, I'm sort of
3 indifferent to that in some sense. I mean,
4 people sue, and that's your right as an American,
5 to bring lawsuits.
6 Q. What did you mean when you said, "My
7 personal feelings regarding people have a choice
8 to smoke or not, they're their own agent, and
9 those feelings would be consistent with the idea
10 of doing this work," what did you mean?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
12 A. I mean that as a general proposition, I
13 think that that is the case; that individuals
14 have choice, they have agency. But, again, as
15 Professor Norrell, who is a great historian, told
16 me, you know, he tries to be honest with the
17 facts, and I'm trying to be honest with the
18 facts.
19 Q. And how is that feeling consistent with
20 doing this work?
21
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
22 A. Well, it involves individuals bringing
23 lawsuits. And I think as a general proposition,
0024
1 they're individuals like others are. They're
2 adults, they can choose. But, again, the
3 evidence could lead me in a lot of different
4 directions. It has in the past as a historian
5 many times.
6
MR. MITNIK: Okay. At the end of the
7 deposition, I'm not going to conclude it, I'm
8 going to suspend it, and I'm going to move to
9 compel the answer to these questions; but for the
10 time being, I'm going to go forward with the
11 deposition.
12 Q. Did you discuss how much money you could
13 make per case, what the range was, with Dr.
14 Norrell or Mr. Norrell?
15 A. I may have. I don't remember. I probably
16 did, but I don't remember specific conversations
17 about that.
18 Q. In the conversation you probably had about
19 how much money you could make in each of these
20 cases, what role did that play in your interest
21 in doing these kind of cases?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
23 A. Again, the main thing is, I'm not going to
0025
1 take a case I'm not comfortable with. So
2 certainly the money played a role, but it sounded
3 like exciting work and it sounded like something
4 that, you know, I would be comfortable doing.
5 I'm not going to -- you know, as a historian, I'm
6 going to be true to my field no matter what kind
7 of case I take.
8 Q. But the bottom line, per your answer you
9 just gave, is that after having this conversation
10 with Mr. Norrell, that you probably had regarding
11 how much money you could make per case, the money
12 did play a role? Not the only role but a role,
13 correct?
14 A. It played a role, sure.
15 Q. And what is your understanding of the range
16 that you would make on one of these cases that
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 went to trial?
18 A. Again, I don't know if I had a dollar
19 figure from him. You know, I don't remember a
20 specific amount, but I remember that it was --
21 you know, in the past I had been offered
22 consulting work, and it was like, you know, I
23 remember it was $100 an hour or something like
0026
1 that. I wasn't able to take it at the time
2 because I was on the job market and trying to get
3 a permanent history position. So I knew it would
4 probably be in that range, $100 or more.
5 Q. How much do you charge per hour?
6 A. $200.
7 Q. How many of these cases do you have
8 currently on your list of cases? How many are
9 you working on?
10 A. Quite a few, I think four or five. And
11 some of them have been kind of dormant for a
12 while. But one is very active now, other than
13 this case.
14 Q. What's the other one that's very active?
15
MR. COTTON: Just for the record, the other
16 case that you're alluding to, is it one that you
17 know you've been disclosed in?
18 A. Yes, it's the other one I -- I have been
19 disclosed in the other one.
20 Q. What is it?
21 A. It's Thibault.
22 Q. "Thibault" is spelled?
23 A. T-H-I-B-A-U-L-T.
0027
1 Q. Is that a Florida case?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Have you been deposed in it?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. When were you deposed?
6 A. In, it was either -- I think it was
7 December is when I was deposed in that.
8 Q. Do you recall the name of the lawyer who
9 took your deposition?
10 A. No, I don't.
11 Q. Any other depositions been taken in any
12 cigarette company cases?
13 A. No.
14 Q. How many times has your deposition been
15 taken on any kind of case?
16 A. No other cases.
17 Q. So this is your second deposition in your
18 life?
19 A. That's right.
20 Q. Have you testified at trial?
21 A. No.
22 Q. How many hours do you currently have in
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 this case up to today?
0028
1 A. Let's see. I'm not sure the total number
2 of hours. I know the total amount that it adds
3 up to.
4 Q. That will do.
5 A. $39,000.
6 Q. When were you hired?
7 A. In this particular case?
8 Q. Yes.
9 A. In September.
10 Q. So $39,000 in seven months?
11 A. Uh-huh. Yes.
12 Q. At the time of your deposition in December
13 in this other case, was the amount similar?
14 A. The amount of time spent on it?
15 Q. The amount of money.
16 A. Oh, the amount of money? It probably was
17 pretty similar, maybe a little bit less, but I'm
18 not sure how much it was. But it probably was a
19 little bit less, but it wasn't far off.
20 Q. Okay. And is your hourly rate the same
21 regardless of what you're doing in the case,
22 whether it's trial testimony or research?
23 A. Same.
0029
1 Q. Do you get to keep that money yourself?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. So how much would you say that you have
4 made off the other two or three cases, not
5 including this one and the one you've been
6 deposed in?
7 A. I'm not sure exactly, but it could be in
8 the range of $300,000, something like that,
9 maybe.
10 Q. So $300,000 plus these two?
11
MR. COTTON: Object to form,
12 mischaracterizes testimony.
13 Q. I just want to understand.
14 A. Probably total. I'm not sure exactly how
15 much, but somewhere in that range.
16 Q. Is that range of approximately $300,000 for
17 the other cases --
18 A. No, everything, everything as a whole.
19 Q. Everything?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. And over what time period? When did you
22 start?
23 A. 2008. 2008. End of 2008.
0030
1 Q. Do you make more money from doing this
2 work, now that you're doing it, than you do from
3 your salary as a teacher?
4
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 A. I'm trying to figure out how that is. I
6 don't know if it's more, but it's pretty close to
7 as much as I make.
8 Q. Did you have to take any reduction in your
9 income as a teacher to do this work?
10 A. No.
11 Q. So this is all new or found money,
12 additional money?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
14 A. It's additional money.
15 Q. So you basically doubled your income by
16 doing this kind of work; is that fair?
17
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
18 mischaracterizes testimony.
19 A. I don't know if it's quite double, but it's
20 probably close to that.
21
MR. COTTON: Dr. Beito, could you do me a
22 favor and pause after he asks the question, in
23 the event I have an objection?
0031
1
THE WITNESS: Sure, will do.
2 Q. Now, tell me, after you had this
3 conversation with Mr. -- is it Dr. or Mr.
4 Norrell?
5 A. It's Dr. Norrell.
6 Q. After this conversation with Dr. Norrell,
7 what happened next when you expressed an interest
8 in doing it?
9 A. It took a long time, but he told his lawyer
10 about it. The one he worked with was Christine
11 Lawson, and she contacted me. It was probably a
12 few months later.
13 Q. When would that be, approximately?
14 A. Oh, I guess it would have been probably
15 summer of '08, was the initial contact, then she
16 didn't get back to me again until like -- I guess
17 it was around October.
18 Q. And then when she got back to you, what
19 happened next?
20 A. Went to Atlanta to the offices of Jones,
21 Day and met with her.
22 Q. How long did that take, the meeting?
23 A. It wasn't too long. I'd say maybe three
0032
1 hours or something like that. It's been a long
2 time.
3 Q. What happened at that meeting?
4 A. She described what the work involved and
5 basically stressed to me that I should, you know,
6 do what I normally do; that they're interested in
7 having somebody use, you know, the historical
8 method, which is what I use and what I teach
9 students.
10 Q. What did she describe your work would
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 involve?
12 A. Well, initially it would involve and it did
13 involve a lot of background research, which is,
14 again, what I generally do when I come into a
15 topic, you know, just to know as much as I could
16 about the general question. And then, you know,
17 she said it would involve individuals who were
18 bringing lawsuits. But initially it was a lot of
19 background research.
20 Q. Were there any discussions in that meeting
21 or at any time about whether or not part of your
22 research should or should not include internal
23 documents of the cigarette company?
0033
1 A. No, there was no discussion like that.
2 Q. Are you aware, either from what you've
3 learned being in this work or coming into the
4 work, that there are accessible websites that
5 have a mass of internal cigarette company
6 documents?
7 A. Oh, very rapidly I became aware of that,
8 and I've used those websites.
9 Q. What websites have you used?
10 A. It's called Legacy website.
11 Q. Have you used any other than Legacy?
12 A. Yes, I think there are other ones I've
13 used, but I think they have a lot of similar
14 kinds of documents. And I forget what the names
15 of those are, but Legacy is the main one I use.
16 Q. How many times do you think you've accessed
17 Legacy?
18 A. Oh, many, many times. I don't know,
19 hundreds, maybe.
20 Q. And why would you access it?
21 A. Well, it has a lot of valuable historical
22 information on it which touch on the issues of
23 public awareness, and I've made use of that
0034
1 information.
2 Q. So you would consider internal documents of
3 the cigarette company that touch on the subject
4 of public awareness to be a valid source of your
5 research?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 A. That would shed light on what information
8 reached the public. And then also polling
9 information, because part of what I'm looking at
10 are public opinion polls. So the kinds of things
11 that I would look at in terms of awareness would
12 be really limited, I would say, to transcripts,
13 because there are many transcripts of radio and
14 television shows on those websites that are
15 otherwise inaccessible; you know, the show may
16 not exist anymore on tape.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 Q. In your research have you come across any
18 of the documents that discuss the cigarette
19 companies' plan to try to create a controversy?
20
MR. COTTON: Object to the form, lacks
21 foundation.
22 A. Again, I'm looking at the documents as I
23 would for any research collection that bear the
0035
1 topic. And the topic that I'm doing research on
2 is what reached the public; public awareness in
3 terms of media, television, radio; in this
4 particular case, what reached Karen Whitney and
5 pulled at her. So I don't look at the whole
6 collection. There are, I believe, thousands and
7 thousands of documents, and that certainly is the
8 case in a lot of research collections I look at.
9 There are boxes and boxes and boxes. You could
10 never go through all of them. It wouldn't make
11 sense to go through all of them, because you've
12 got a targeted thing you're looking for.
13 Q. I move to strike the answer and I would ask
14 the court reporter to read it back.
15 Unresponsive.
16
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
17 portion of the testimony was read back by the
18 court reporter.)
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
20 foundation.
21 A. When I'm on the Legacy website, I've not
22 come across those documents. I've looked for
23 those documents, and I haven't come across those
0036
1 documents on the Legacy website.
2 Q. You have looked for them or have not?
3 A. Have not, because they do not bear on the
4 issue of public awareness, what reached the
5 public. A radio transcript would, say Paul
6 Harvey or 60 Minutes or whatever.
7 Q. All right. Have you come across those
8 documents in any other location or fashion?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
10 A. When I read some of the secondary work, and
11 we're talking about quite a few years ago, I
12 might have seen references. I saw references to
13 some documents, but it's been a long time since
14 I've read those. But the original documents
15 themselves, that's not part of, you know, what
16 I've been focusing on.
17 Q. Have you seen any of the original documents
18 that we're talking about?
19 A. No. No.
20 Q. Why would you be looking at these secondary
21 sources?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 A. The secondary sources will often have
0037
1 discussion about awareness issues, often have
2 discussion about poll data, that kind of thing.
3 Q. So was part of your --
4 A. Public policies, certainly that would be
5 part of what they would discuss as well, which is
6 certainly of interest, labeling laws and that
7 kind of thing.
8 Q. So in doing your background search and
9 being prepared to render opinions, one of the
10 things you looked at would be secondary sources?
11 A. Yes. I didn't read every word. I skimmed
12 a lot of them, but I did look at them, some of
13 the standard works that have been done.
14 Q. Such as?
15 A. Oh, boy. It's been a long time. Richard
16 Kluger's book, Ashes to Ashes; and then Cassandra
17 Tate's book on the kind of anti-tobacco movements
18 that arose in the Nineteenth and early Twentieth
19 Centuries. And some other work, but it's been --
20 you know, I've sort of moved beyond that stage of
21 the secondary work quite a long time ago, but
22 those would be two examples that come to mind.
23 Q. I know Ashes to Ashes. What was the other
0038
1 book?
2 A. Maybe Cigarette Wars or something like
3 that.
4 Q. Did you read Cigarette Century?
5 A. No. I'm aware of it.
6 Q. How about A Question of Intent?
7 A. No, I didn't read that.
8 Q. How about Golden Holocaust?
9 A. No, I did not read that.
10 Q. At any time did you sign any type of
11 agreement with the lawyers or RJR or any
12 cigarette company?
13 A. You know, I don't recall signing anything,
14 now that you bring it up. I don't think I did.
15 I don't recall it.
16 Q. No confidentiality agreement of any kind?
17 A. No, I don't remember anything like that.
18 Q. How about a retainer agreement or fee
19 agreement?
20 A. I don't remember signing anything like
21 that.
22 Q. How about, was there any paperwork laying
23 out what the terms of your relationship would be?
0039
1 A. No, I don't remember anything like that. I
2 only remember one piece of paperwork there.
3 Q. What was that?
4 A. That was an article they gave me written by
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 a gentleman who was at Mississippi State who is a
6 historian who's done work on --
7 Q. Who?
8 A. Kyriakoudes, I think is how it's
9 pronounced. I've never met him. But it was an
10 article that he'd written, and it was the only
11 paperwork I remember from that meeting.
12 Q. What was the purpose of giving you that one
13 piece of paper, as you understood it?
14 A. I think it was to sort of introduce me,
15 because it was on -- it was on being a legal
16 expert. It was a discussion of that. And if you
17 were to ask me what the thesis was or anything, I
18 really couldn't tell you. It was a short article
19 that I got.
20 Q. Do you recall what it was called?
21 A. No, I don't, but I know it was written by
22 Kyriakoudes, and it had to do -- I know he's done
23 other kinds of historical research, but it was
0040
1 more on historians in the courtroom kind of
2 thing. Maybe it was particular reference -- it
3 might have been with particular reference to the
4 tobacco industry, but it might have been more
5 general than that.
6 Q. Aside from your research, did you do any
7 training as far as being an expert witness?
8 A. Any training?
9 Q. Yes.
10 A. No, other than I was using the same
11 historical method that I've been using for -- I
12 don't know, since the 1980s.
13
MR. COTTON: I belatedly object to the form
14 of that question.
15 Q. I'm actually talking about training for
16 testimony; for example, deposition or trial
17 testimony.
18 A. I would meet with the lawyers, yes. Yes.
19 Q. Tell me about that.
20 A. Well, you know, I would apprise them of
21 what I had been doing in terms of research, and
22 then a fair amount of it was where they would ask
23 me the kinds of questions I might be asked at a
0041
1 deposition or at, I guess, a trial as well.
2 Q. When you say "a fair amount of it," what's
3 your best estimate of the amount of time or
4 number of times you did that?
5 A. Oh, number of times I did that? Boy. I
6 might have been -- I might have done this eight
7 times, maybe, over the years.
8 Q. And what was the average length of those
9 sessions?
10 A. Oh, typically they would go the whole
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 morning, and then occasionally they would go for
12 an hour or two after lunch. But usually they
13 were done in a morning, it seemed like, it seems
14 like. Most of the time I think they would be
15 done by lunch.
16 Q. And how many lawyers would be participating
17 in that with you?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
19 A. That would vary. Usually it would just be
20 one, but there was at least one where there were
21 like four or five lawyers there.
22 Q. And what happened in the one where four or
23 five were there? What were all the lawyers
0042
1 doing? Were each of them asking you questions?
2 A. Yes, they were.
3 Q. Types of questions that the lawyer on the
4 other side may be asking you, like
5 cross-examination?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. And then would they critique your answers?
8 A. Yes. In a general sense, yes.
9 Q. In what way?
10
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
11 A. Oh, I don't know if I remember, you know, a
12 specific example. They would often tell me,
13 "Hey, tell them the truth" and, you know, "Be
14 short and concise as much as possible," which is
15 hard for historians to do.
16 Q. So they told you to tell the truth and to
17 be short and concise. What other critiques would
18 they have in these approximate eight sessions
19 that would take at least a half-a-day each? I
20 presume they said more than that. What else?
21
MR. COTTON: Objection to the form.
22 A. Maybe there was a particular area that I
23 hadn't done enough research on, I didn't feel
0043
1 comfortable with it; and they would just sort of
2 say, "Yes, maybe you need to look a little bit
3 more into that area as a general sense, in terms
4 of sources." Just, I guess you'd call it, a
5 brainstorming thing in terms of, you know,
6 research, research ideas and suggestions.
7 Q. What suggestions were you given as to what
8 to do if you were asked about or shown any
9 internal documents of the company?
10 A. I wasn't given any suggestions. I'm sorry.
11
MR. COTTON: I'll object to the form.
12 A. I wasn't given any suggestions about what
13 to do.
14 Q. So it would be your testimony that in the
15 approximate eight sessions that took at least
16 half-a-day, the subject of internal documents
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 that may talk about a plan to create controversy,
18 that subject never came up?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
20 A. Oh, it might have come up as an issue that
21 would be raised by people asking me questions.
22 Q. Tell me about that. How would that come
23 up?
0044
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. They would say that I might be asked about,
3 you know, these internal documents; and I said,
4 "Fine," and said, "Look, that's not where I did
5 my research. My research has been focused on
6 public awareness." And so I limited myself to
7 that. But I did look at -- you know, I did look
8 at the Legacy website because I said, "Look,
9 there are sources here that would bear on that
10 potentially." And so I tried to do that. It
11 turned out a lot of those ended up kind of just
12 confirming corroborating information that I found
13 elsewhere.
14 Q. Were any of these sessions, where you went
15 over potential questions that the lawyer on the
16 other side may ask, videotaped?
17 A. I don't think so, no. No, they weren't.
18 Q. Any written reports from those sessions?
19 A. Not that I know of.
20 Q. Any suggestions of things like if you're at
21 trial, look at the jury when you're answering the
22 question?
23 A. No, I don't remember anything like that.
0045
1 Q. Would all these lawyers, to your knowledge,
2 have been from Jones, Day, or did some of them
3 come from other law firms?
4 A. Philip Morris, and there might have been
5 somebody from another law firm. Maybe -- I don't
6 know. There might have been another company. I
7 know Phillip Morris was one of the other ones,
8 but I'm not sure what the other company was. It
9 was just maybe one meeting.
10
MR. COTTON: To clarify, when you're
11 talking about lawyers, outside counsel for those
12 companies?
13 A. Yes, outside counsel for those companies.
14 Q. So you have been at the sessions we've been
15 talking about where not only were attorneys for
16 R.J. Reynolds there, but attorneys also present
17 at the same meeting from Phillip Morris and
18 another cigarette company; is that correct?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, overly
20 broad.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Where would these meetings take place?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 A. It all runs together in my head. I think
0046
1 one of them was -- I mean, there were several.
2 Most of them were probably -- were in Atlanta,
3 but there was one at least that was somewhere in
4 Florida. I think that was in -- it might have
5 been in Miami.
6 Q. Do you know why it was in Miami instead of
7 Atlanta?
8 A. I don't know. I was doing research there,
9 but I don't know if they did it for that purpose
10 or not. It was after I was done doing some
11 research there.
12 Q. Did Dr. Norrell participate in any of those
13 sessions?
14 A. No.
15 Q. Any other historians or expert witnesses
16 attend any of those sessions?
17 A. No.
18 Q. Were you paid for your time when you were
19 at those training sessions?
20
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
21 A. Yes, the normal hourly rate.
22 Q. What else would you do in those training
23 sessions?
0047
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
2 mischaracterizes testimony.
3 A. That's about it.
4 Q. And when you say "that's about it," what do
5 you mean?
6 A. Well, I would apprise them of where my
7 research stood, how much more I felt I need to do
8 to be comfortable. As a historian, you're never
9 comfortable. And then also the questions, where
10 they would ask questions that I might be asked at
11 deposition or at trial. I think they were mainly
12 at depositions, because I haven't had trial yet.
13 Q. Did you find these training sessions --
14 regarding the part of it that dealt with the
15 questions you might be asked -- helpful in that
16 regard?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to the form,
18 mischaracterizes testimony.
19 A. Yes, I would say.
20 Q. How were they helpful?
21 A. It just gave me a sense of maybe the kinds
22 of questions I would be asked; you know, help to
23 be prepared.
0048
1 Q. How would it help to be prepared by the
2 kinds of questions you would be asked?
3 A. Well, I mean, it's always good when I go
4 into a situation, when I was preparing for
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 preliminary examinations, to get a sense of what
6 it was like, because I had never been deposed
7 before until recently.
8 Q. When you were deposed, had they covered a
9 lot -- had they accurately covered a lot of the
10 type of questions you were going to be asked?
11 Had they predicted well?
12
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
13 A. No. The last time, I guess, was sort of --
14 a lot of the questions I anticipated were not
15 asked, so there were always surprises. But they
16 anticipate, you know, some, but not everything,
17 because things are just unpredictable, I guess.
18 Q. After you were hired to do this work, were
19 you given any of the research materials that had
20 been done by Dr. Norrell or others, other
21 historians?
22 A. Not Norrell, but there was a historian that
23 I met with, I flew out and met with him, named
0049
1 Jim Martin. And I spent a lot of time with him,
2 and he gave me some materials. I mean, I said --
3 he showed me what he had, and I said, "I would
4 like copies of this and this and this," and he
5 had them sent to me.
6 Q. When you say you spent a lot of time with
7 him, how much, in your best estimate?
8 A. I guess it was a morning and maybe the
9 first part of an afternoon.
10 Q. More than one trip or one?
11 A. No, just one trip with him.
12 Q. Where was he?
13 A. That was in Houston.
14 Q. And what's his name?
15 A. Jim Martin, James Kirby Martin.
16 Q. Whose idea was it for you to go meet with
17 him?
18 A. I'm sorry? Excuse me?
19 Q. Whose idea was it for you to go meet with
20 him?
21 A. Oh, I don't remember. One of the lawyers
22 might have suggested that, you know, I might want
23 to meet with one of the other historians and, you
0050
1 know, we initiated contact. So it might have
2 been one of the lawyers who suggested it.
3 Probably was. But I initiated the contact with
4 him.
5 Q. One of the lawyers suggested that you
6 initiate contact with Mr. Martin and meet with
7 him, correct?
8 A. That I might want to, that I might find it
9 helpful, yes.
10 Q. Did you find it helpful?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 A. Yes, I did.
12 Q. In what regard?
13 A. Well, it was helpful to meet, you know --
14 like these sessions, it was helpful to meet
15 somebody who had been through the process, and he
16 had been through trial and so forth. He was a
17 fellow historian so, you know, we could compare
18 notes on how you go about doing research on this
19 topic. And he had some research -- he had copied
20 some material that was useful.
21 Q. In your discussions with him having been
22 through trials before and sharing his experience,
23 what did he tell you about what to expect at
0051
1 trial?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
3 foundation, assumes facts.
4 A. I don't remember the specifics, but I think
5 he just sort of gave me a general sense of, you
6 know, "Here are the kinds of questions you get."
7 A lot of it was talking over sources, what are
8 some good sources to get at issues of public
9 awareness, to get at issues such as, you know,
10 poll data and videos and audios, and that kind of
11 thing.
12 Q. When he talked to you about, "Here are the
13 type of questions you get," what did he talk
14 about in regard to they will ask you about
15 internal documents?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
17 A. I don't remember talking about that. I do
18 remember, though, him stressing, "Look, you're
19 doing research on awareness issues. And as in
20 any sort of historian, you play to your
21 strengths, your research strength." And that's
22 my research strength.
23 Q. What's your research strength?
0052
1 A. Well, hopefully that, you know, I've got
2 some experience and done some work, and I know
3 how to do research. But looking at the issues
4 of, in this particular situation I'm focusing on
5 the issues of awareness, and of course with
6 particular reference to Karen Whitney, awareness
7 of the dangers of smoking, the risks of smoking,
8 whether or not it's risky, whether or not it's
9 habit-forming. So as a general situation I've
10 looked at that, then as an individual I've looked
11 at Karen Whitney.
12 Q. Now, you said that in your meeting with
13 Dr. Martin that he said, "Look" -- he stressed or
14 emphasized, I think is the word, emphasized,
15 "Look, you're doing research on public awareness.
16 Play to your strength"?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 A. I don't know if he used those words. I'm
18 sort of putting words in his mouth, probably, in
19 some sense. But certainly that, I think part of
20 the thing was, you know, "You're not a doctor."
21 I am a doctor, but I'm not a medical doctor; I'm
22 not a pharmacologist, you know. I'm a historian,
23 and I'm looking at one particular set of topics.
0053
1 Q. And did you discuss with him that because
2 you're looking at this one specific set of
3 topics, that there was no need to go comb through
4 internal documents that may speak to any
5 agreement to create controversy or otherwise?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to the form.
7 A. No, I think the opposite was true. I mean,
8 as far as internal documents in general, you
9 know, he talked about the Legacy website. He
10 used it himself.
11 Q. Did you talk with him at all about
12 narrowing what you looked at in the Legacy
13 documents as opposed to going into internal
14 documents that talked about the company's, for
15 example, view on the addictiveness of nicotine?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
17 A. No, there was no need to narrow; because as
18 a historian, you know, I'm going to focus in on
19 the topic at hand. I'm going to do that in any
20 manuscript collection. He emphasized that it had
21 a relatively easy to use search mechanism, so I
22 made use of that to look at the areas I was doing
23 research on. As a historian, I focus in on
0054
1 issues of awareness, what reached the public,
2 what do they know about the dangers of smoking,
3 when did they know it or at least when were they
4 exposed to it, and issues such as the
5 habit-forming nature; is it a habit that's
6 difficult to break, that kind of thing. There's
7 plenty out there and I'm plenty busy doing that
8 work.
9 Q. What documents did he give you?
10 A. Oh, quite a lot. I think there were some
11 periodicals he gave me, such as Reader's Digest
12 was one. There was a magazine called Good
13 Health; he had some PSAs by the American Cancer
14 Society that he gave me. And I'm sure there was
15 other material. It was quite a bit of material,
16 but those are the ones that come to mind.
17 Periodicals and things like that.
18 Q. Were they on disc or hard copy?
19 A. No, they were all hard copy.
20 Q. Did he give you anything on disc, in
21 digital form from a computer?
22 A. Yes, some videos.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 Q. Anything else?
0055
1 A. It was just videos and I guess some -- I'm
2 trying to think if there were audios, but I don't
3 think there were audios. I think they were just
4 videos.
5 Q. So you did not get, for example, a flash
6 drive or an e-mail that contained attachments of
7 documents?
8 A. No, I don't think I did. He did send me
9 something that he had done, I guess, for a case
10 once. It was a background, sort of a historical
11 background of a case he had done. And that's the
12 only thing I think he sent me that was like an
13 attachment or something like that.
14 Q. With documents or just showing an outline
15 of what he did?
16 A. It was a document. It was a written paper
17 that he had done.
18 Q. A summary in a case?
19 A. Yes. It's been a long time since I read
20 it. I read it like 2008. But it was like expert
21 testimony or expert background on a particular
22 case. I'm not sure even what state it was or
23 anything.
0056
1 Q. Do you still have that?
2 A. I have it somewhere. I could dig it out.
3 Q. Please don't get rid of that. I would ask
4 that you do dig it out and --
5 A. Sure.
6 Q. -- I would like to attach that as Exhibit 1
7 to the deposition. Do you have a list of the
8 documents he gave you?
9 A. No, I don't have a list. He sent me some
10 boxes.
11 Q. Were they in boxes?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. How many boxes?
14 A. Oh, maybe four, four or five boxes.
15 Q. What size boxes?
16 A. I don't know what -- I guess -- they
17 weren't -- they weren't gigantic boxes. They
18 were book boxes. I don't remember what size
19 specifically, but they weren't those really big
20 ones that you fill up with books you can't lift
21 or anything. You could lift them.
22 Q. Were they shipped to you? How did he get
23 them back to you?
0057
1 A. They were shipped to me.
2 Q. Did you get documents from any other source
3 where someone else had gathered them and gave
4 them to you?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
6 A. Yes. The only other one that comes to
7 mind -- and we've traded documents, I've probably
8 given him more than he's given me -- is a
9 historian who's doing this kind of work at
10 University of Florida named Alan Petigny. And,
11 of course, in my research over the years, I've
12 gotten documents from other scholars who have
13 done research but are not, you know, doing the
14 same kind of consulting work I'm doing.
15 Q. How do you spell Alan Petigny?
16 A. P-E-T-I-G-N-Y.
17 Q. Is he new to this, too?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
19 A. Yes, he's new. He's newer than I am.
20 Q. Has he been deposed, to your knowledge?
21 A. I don't believe he has.
22 Q. Did you get any records from a Dr. Lacy?
23 A. Lacy Ford?
0058
1 Q. Yes.
2 A. I'm trying to think. No, I don't believe I
3 did. I may have had a conversation with him, but
4 I'm not even sure about that. I may have had a
5 conversation with him a long time ago. But, no,
6 I didn't get any documents from him.
7 Q. When you were training to do this, were you
8 given any transcripts of either trial testimony
9 or deposition testimony of other historians on
10 this subject?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
12 mischaracterizes testimony.
13 A. Yes, I was given some transcripts. They
14 were of historians being questioned --
15 Q. Was there a trial?
16 A. -- and I don't know if they were for trial
17 or deposition. I'm not sure.
18 Q. Approximately how many did you get?
19 A. Not many. Maybe three. Not too many.
20 Q. Do you remember who the historians were?
21 A. Oh, boy. I think one of them was Norrell;
22 one of them was Martin. And I don't know who the
23 third one was. It might have been Ford, but I
0059
1 don't know for sure.
2
(Whereupon, at this time a short break was
3 taken.)
4 Q. What was your understanding of your
5 assignment --
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 Q. -- in general, when you started doing this
8 work?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
10 A. My understanding was that I was going to
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 look at issues of public awareness, to what
12 extent that Americans know cigarette smoking was
13 dangerous, and issues of whether or not it was
14 addictive, and that I was going to use the same
15 methods that I used as a historian in my other
16 projects, my research over the years.
17 Q. All right. Let's talk about addiction.
18 What did you find in regard to addiction? What
19 conclusions did you reach?
20
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
21 A. Well, it's hard to sum that up, but that it
22 certainly was considered an issue way back to
23 when tobacco was first introduced into Europe.
0060
1 It was said at the time by observers that they
2 would observe the Native Americans and said it
3 almost had a -- as if it had a bewitching effect
4 on them. And you had terms such as "addiction"
5 used Nineteenth Century; you had a lot of
6 emphasis on how cigarette smoking -- tobacco in
7 general, but cigarette smoking as well, could be
8 a very difficult habit for people to break, and
9 "addiction" would often be used as a word to
10 describe that. Sometimes words like I said
11 "bewitching" or "slavery," words like that would
12 be used as well to describe that. And that this
13 was, you know, widely communicated through the
14 media, newspapers, television, slang,
15 expressions, and so forth; that this is a
16 dangerous habit, potentially, and that it is very
17 much habit-forming.
18 Q. So are you telling me that the information
19 you were reading was that the common experiences
20 described in the information you would be able to
21 access was one of a powerful addiction that
22 actually enslaved its user?
23 A. Sometimes expressions like that would be
0061
1 used. But even people that used terms like
2 "slavery" would usually say, "Look, you can quit
3 this. You can break the grip of this."
4 Q. Sure.
5 A. So that was always part of what was
6 emphasized as well as part of this. And we
7 certainly see that in the, you know, case of
8 Karen Whitney where, you know, this was discussed
9 in the newspapers that were subscribed to in the
10 home and publications that appeared in the
11 community, and so forth.
12 Q. I'm going to move to strike as
13 nonresponsive and ask you if you can answer my
14 question. I'd ask the reporter to please read
15 back my question.
16
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 portion of the testimony was read back by the
18 court reporter.)
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, asked and
20 answered. Answer it again, if you can.
21 A. That was -- that was often emphasized, but
22 then there was a proviso. Slavery is something
23 that can be, I guess you can break out of; but
0062
1 it's, you know, almost impossible. It was
2 emphasized very often that you can break free
3 from this, much more than you would have with
4 conventional slavery. It was phrasing to
5 illustrate how powerful the grip was.
6 Q. So your historical analysis was that many,
7 many people were reporting that this addiction
8 had a powerful grip? It's not impossible to get
9 free from, could get free from, but indeed was a
10 powerful grip. Is that correct?
11 A. Yes, that's true.
12 Q. And often referred to using the term
13 "addiction"?
14 A. Often you would see that, yes.
15 Q. In your investigation, did you come across
16 any data that would answer or help answer the
17 question if it was so prevalent that this was a
18 powerful addiction that would have a grip that
19 would be very hard to get free from, although not
20 impossible, why that didn't have more of a
21 deterrent effect to people doing it in the first
22 place --
23
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
0063
1 Q. -- assuming there was public awareness as
2 to that power?
3
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
4 A. That's a good question. I'm not a
5 pharmacologist, I'm not a psychologist. So when
6 you get into the issue of behavior in the sense
7 of, you know, psychological motivation, it's sort
8 of out of my area.
9 Q. I'm not asking you to tell me from a
10 psychologist's perspective. I'm asking you from
11 a historian's perspective, did you find any
12 information that would suggest why there was not
13 more of a deterrent effect?
14
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
15 A. Didn't really focus on that area as a
16 historian. I'm trying to think of -- certainly,
17 you know, people would often stress that, you
18 know, "I was warned it was addictive and, boy, I
19 didn't know how addictive it was," you know, that
20 kind of thing.
21 Q. Where would you see that?
22 A. I think just sort of general discussion
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 you'd see that in newspaper articles and that
0064
1 kind of thing.
2 Q. Can you cite me to any of them where they
3 said, "I was warned it was addictive, but I
4 didn't know it was going to be that bad"?
5 A. I can't recall any specific ones. But if I
6 went through, I think I would find them. You
7 also had people say, "It wasn't that difficult
8 for me to quit." So you have both sides of the
9 spectrum. I've seen a case like that as well.
10 Q. From a historical perspective, did you see
11 people that said, "I had no idea I was getting
12 into something that would be that addictive"?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
14 A. I don't know if they used those words.
15 Q. Let me be clear. I'm not asking about
16 those words. The gist of that type comment?
17
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
18 A. I think I would probably have come across
19 cases like that. I don't think that that was
20 incredibly common where I would see that, where
21 they would talk about, "Gee, I didn't know." The
22 usual comment people would make is, "Boy, this is
23 hard to quit." It wasn't so much like, "Gee,
0065
1 nobody warned me about it." It was like, "Gee,
2 this is hard to quit." That would be the general
3 thing I'd see. Occasionally you might see
4 somebody say something like that, too, but that
5 was not the norm. The norm would be just talking
6 about how difficult it is to quit.
7 Q. Was the norm to see words to the effect, "I
8 was warned it was addictive, but I didn't know it
9 was going to be this bad"?
10 A. No, I wouldn't say that was norm. The norm
11 was, "Boy, this is difficult to quit." The
12 second part of that, that's the norm.
13 Q. Would you agree that from your historical
14 assessment that a significant portion of
15 Americans were smoking cigarettes in the '40s,
16 '50s, and '60s?
17 A. Yes, I would.
18 Q. What percentage?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
20 A. Well, I've seen percentages -- I think
21 according to the Gallup poll it crested at about
22 45 percent around 1954. So that's about as high
23 as it got if you look at the total adult
0066
1 population.
2 Q. Now, do you know how many millions of
3 people that would have been?
4 A. No. But I don't know, what do you have
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 population-wise then, 130 million people.
6 Obviously, a lot of those were children, so I'm
7 not sure what numbers that would be in terms of
8 millions of people.
9 Q. So close to half of American adults -- not
10 adults. Close to half of Americans --
11 A. No, American adults.
12 Q. What was adult measured as? What was the
13 cutoff for an adult?
14
MR. COTTON: Objection. Objection to the
15 form.
16 A. I'm not sure. I think it would really
17 vary. Maybe 17, 18. I'm not sure. It might
18 have been 18, it might have been 17. I'm not
19 sure.
20 Q. But the 45 percent wouldn't include all the
21 13, 14, 15, 16-year-olds that were smoking?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
23 A. I don't think it would. But, again, I've
0067
1 got to look at what the age cutoff is, but I
2 don't think it would.
3 Q. You would agree that there was a very large
4 segment of teenagers that would have been smoking
5 at that time, at the time we're talking about,
6 '40s, '50s, '60s?
7
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
8 foundation, calls for speculation.
9 A. Yes. I haven't really done research on
10 those percentages. You know, what's the
11 distinction between somebody that just tries a
12 cigarette, like I did when I was nine years old,
13 and somebody who is a regular smoker. I haven't
14 looked into that, you know, the numbers of
15 people, you know, in that age group that would be
16 considered regular smokers.
17 Q. Did you see in the polls that there were a
18 vast number of teenagers that were smoking?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
20 foundation.
21 A. I saw polls, you know, indicating there
22 were teenagers who had -- you know, I don't know
23 about vast numbers, but there were significant
0068
1 numbers who had smoked. But as to whether they
2 were regular smokers or not, I didn't really look
3 into that.
4 Q. Why not?
5 A. Because my main focus was on awareness
6 issues; what reached the public, what reached
7 Karen Whitney about the dangers of smoking.
8 These awareness issues go back to the public
9 school system and start there, parents and family
10 and friends, examples.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 Q. So if it was being taught by parents and in
12 the public schools, and you were trying to get
13 the whole picture on awareness, wouldn't it be
14 significant, do you know, how many teenagers and
15 school-age kids were smoking?
16 A. I'm more interested in information that
17 reached people, information that reached the
18 public, about whether or not smoking was bad for
19 you, whether or not it was habit-forming. That
20 was my focus.
21 Q. Did you do any investigation to see what
22 role cigarette companies had in the black of more
23 deterrent effect, and if there was public
0069
1 awareness as to the power of this addiction?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
3 foundation.
4 A. I was certainly -- you know, as part of my
5 research, newspapers, television media, radios,
6 you would have the perspective of cigarette
7 companies being expressed in those publications,
8 and I took note of that.
9 Q. Such as?
10
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
11 A. Could you be more specific?
12 Q. Sure. What would they have said that could
13 touch on this subject of why there wasn't more
14 deterrent if there was public awareness that this
15 was a powerful addiction?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
17 foundation, assumes facts not in evidence.
18 A. Well, again --
19 Q. That it's very, very hard to stop, although
20 not impossible, if that's the general public
21 awareness, why there wasn't more deterrent, my
22 question is, did you find any information that
23 would shed light on that regarding the cigarette
0070
1 companies' public actions?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
3 A. I'm more interested in the result and what
4 is the result -- you know, throughout the 1950s
5 you get more and more awareness and more and more
6 belief over time. And that's consistent, the
7 percentage of the population that says they don't
8 know; the percentage of the population that says,
9 "No, it doesn't cause it" is in decline
10 throughout that period. So I think there's
11 plenty to look at there about what actually
12 happened; not looking at the sort of
13 machinations, internal machinations of the
14 American Cancer Society or tobacco companies in
15 those regards. I'm focused on what actually
16 reached the public and how is that reflected by
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 all sorts of things, including polling data.
18 Q. Right. And the difference between
19 awareness, meaning you heard, for example, of a
20 threat of cancer, versus belief, would be "I
21 believe that it actually is causing cancer,"
22 right?
23
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
0071
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. So when we use the phrase awareness and
3 belief in the context of polls, we're talking
4 about the difference between hearing and
5 believing; is that correct?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 A. Yes, uh-huh.
8 Q. Is that transition from awareness to belief
9 significant in your opinion?
10 A. I think it's very significant and it's very
11 rapid over time, if you track these polls to the
12 extent you can over time.
13 Q. Did you do anything to look into what
14 effect the actions of cigarette companies had on
15 the conversion rate from awareness to belief?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
17 A. No. I'm looking at the conversion rate,
18 which I think is quite impressive. Somebody
19 could try to do something or not try to do
20 something, and whatever they're trying, I've seen
21 a very rapid conversion rate from awareness to
22 belief.
23 Q. Would your question be "I did not do any
0072
1 investigation to see what effect cigarette
2 companies' actions had on the conversion from
3 awareness to belief"?
4
MR. COTTON: I'm sorry. Could you read
5 that back?
6
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
7 portion of the testimony was read back by the
8 court reporter.)
9
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
10 Q. Would that be your answer?
11
MR. COTTON: Same objection.
12 A. I certainly looked at the perspective being
13 expressed by the cigarette companies. I
14 certainly took note of that. And if there was
15 advertising, I took note of that. But I'm
16 focused on what reached the public, what did the
17 public see. You can lead a horse to water, you
18 know, and they were led to water, right, very
19 early. I'm sort of looking at were they led to
20 water, what was that, what was the awareness that
21 was out there; what was the level of information
22 that was out there?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 Q. Did you find any evidence in your research
0073
1 that anything cigarette companies said or did
2 slowed down the conversion rate from awareness to
3 belief?
4
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
5 A. I did not focus on that issue.
6 Q. Would the answer --
7 A. Well, let me say that I have certainly seen
8 poll data where people were asked, "Do you get
9 your information from cigarette companies?" And
10 the poll, the numbers on that are just incredibly
11 small; two, three percent, maybe. Even then, I
12 think that probably that would be asking
13 questions about like the Tobacco Industry
14 Research Council, or Tobacco Institute. It's
15 very small numbers. People, I don't think, get
16 their information from advertising, or they don't
17 look to tobacco companies for information. They
18 don't look to companies in general for
19 information about health. They look to other
20 sources. And I think the polling data does
21 reflect that. So yes, in that sense, yes, it's
22 reflective in the polling data. Yes, there are
23 questions about that.
0074
1 Q. Was the conclusion you reached that nothing
2 cigarette companies said or did affected the
3 conversion rate from awareness to belief?
4
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
5 A. To the extent I see poll data and, again,
6 that's what I'm looking at, I'm not seeing that
7 people are looking to tobacco companies or
8 tobacco institutes for information. It's just a
9 pathetically small group. I don't see any
10 evidence that that group gets any bigger over
11 time.
12 Q. Have you looked into see how the general
13 flow of information -- strike that. Did you
14 look -- do you believe that there was a
15 controversy in the public, very public
16 controversy, in the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, about
17 whether or not cigarettes cause cancer, whether
18 that was definitively proven? Was there
19 controversy over that?
20
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
21 A. I think very early on in the '50s, you do
22 see scientists who are saying, "Well, you know,
23 we're not sure yet what role this plays in lung
0075
1 cancer." But I think that that over time, to the
2 extent there's disagreement on that, that is very
3 early among scientists, anyway. Maybe a few
4 eyeball exceptions, but pretty much by the early
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 '50s, that's when that's there and rapidly sort
6 of goes into decline, I think.
7 Q. I'm not asking you about scientists. I'm
8 talking about basic public milieu. Do you
9 understand what I mean by "milieu"?
10 A. Public opinion? Certainly there --
11
MR. COTTON: I'm sorry. What was the
12 question?
13 Q. Do you understand that I'm talking about
14 the general information environment in the '50s,
15 '60s, '70s, and '80s included a subject whether
16 or not cigarettes cause lung cancer or other
17 serious disease was a controversial issue?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
19 A. Well, if you look again at the earlier
20 period, you see the belief is, you know, in the
21 range that it did, maybe 40 percent, by '60 it's
22 50 percent, it's going up and up and up. So
23 there are still people who aren't convinced. So,
0076
1 yes, I guess you could say there was a
2 controversy among some people. There is not
3 really a controversy that I've seen of any
4 importance in whether or not cigarettes are
5 harmful. If you look at the percentage who say
6 it's harmful, actually it's skyrocketing. I
7 think it gets up to 90 percent by the 1960s.
8 Saying it's harmful may not be lung cancer. It
9 may be other forms of cancer, et cetera.
10 Q. Let me go back to my question. Did you see
11 from your investigation that there was a
12 controversy in the public domain over whether or
13 not lung cancer was caused by smoking that went
14 on from the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s?
15
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, asked and
16 answered.
17 A. There were -- there was a percentage of
18 Americans who were not convinced. That
19 percentage is rapidly falling in the 1950s,
20 1960s, but there are Americans who are still not
21 convinced.
22 Q. I'm not asking whether people were
23 convinced. I'm asking, in the public domain, if
0077
1 you looked at news, if you looked at what was in
2 the press, if you looked in magazine articles, if
3 you walked down the street and talked to people,
4 was there in the public domain a debate or
5 controversy going on of whether or not cigarette
6 smoking caused lung cancer?
7
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
8 A. Yes, there were Americans who did not agree
9 with that. So if you want to call that
10 controversy, that's fine.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 Q. I don't. Actually, I don't. We keep going
12 back to there are Americans that don't believe
13 that.
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. I bet you I could go out and find somebody
16 on the street out there that says the world is
17 flat, somebody. And in answer to the question
18 whether there is an American out there that
19 thought that doesn't mean that there is a
20 controversy about whether the world is flat or
21 round out there in the public domain as a whole.
22 So I'm going to ask you not to answer that some
23 people might have felt that way. I'm asking you,
0078
1 as a historian, about the public domain in
2 general. Did the public domain in the '60s,
3 '70s, and '80s, and '50s include a controversy?
4 A. Could you define what you mean by
5 "controversy"? That might be helpful to me.
6 Q. Sure. What do you mean by controversy? It
7 means it's not -- yes, I'll be glad to define it.
8 Controversy means the jury is still out, no one
9 really knows for sure, there are two sides to
10 this story, we don't have a concrete conclusion.
11 A. Yes, you have people that think that,
12 certainly. You have Americans that think that;
13 diminishing number over time, but there are
14 Americans who think that, yes, who make that kind
15 of argument.
16 Q. Was the question of whether or not lung
17 cancer was caused by cigarette smoking a
18 newsworthy subject in the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
20 A. It was a newsworthy subject, but the news
21 was overwhelmingly saying, "Yes, we have
22 evidence, we have more evidence, we have more
23 evidence." And to the extent there were
0079
1 dissenting opinions, they were over time, to the
2 extent they appeared, were in a story but they
3 would be toward the end of the story; tobacco
4 industry response. And then over time -- most of
5 the time they weren't even there, but over time
6 those diminish. Over time, you see fewer and
7 fewer of those. So I wouldn't quite call that
8 controversy. Certainly, when you get into the
9 late '50s and '60s, I would say there are people
10 that don't agree yet, but does that rise to the
11 level of a controversy? As you said, you know,
12 you could have a disagreement, but that wouldn't
13 be a controversy necessarily. I guess what does
14 the word mean exactly? I guess that's sort of a
15 word that people might disagree about.
16 Q. Are you aware from any source that the
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 cigarette companies entered into a campaign to
18 intentionally create a controversy over whether
19 or not smoking caused lung cancer?
20
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
21 foundation.
22 A. That wasn't my focus. I'm certainly aware
23 of the arguments that they made in the press.
0080
1 That's what I looked at. And I certainly can
2 tell you what those main arguments were, based on
3 my reading of what reached the public.
4 Q. My question is, through any source are you
5 aware of an intentional plan from the cigarette
6 industry to get together, pool money, and
7 intentionally create a controversy about whether
8 or not smoking caused lung cancer, in order to
9 lower the threat level to the public?
10
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
11 foundation.
12 A. I've heard that argument, but I have not
13 done research in that area. As a historian, you
14 know, I hear all sorts of things about the
15 Kennedy assassination, and so forth, but I
16 haven't done research in those particular areas.
17 Q. You haven't been paid $300,000 to
18 investigate the Kennedy assassination, have you?
19 A. No. I --
20
MR. COTTON: Just answer the question.
21 A. No.
22 Q. Okay. So having investigated this question
23 about what the public believed regarding health
0081
1 threats, including lung cancer, wouldn't it be
2 important for you to know the whole story,
3 including what cigarette manufacturers were doing
4 to create a controversy to keep people from fully
5 believing it?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection.
7 Q. Wouldn't that be a worthwhile area for you
8 to look into?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
10 A. Well, again, what I see in the poll
11 data that is --
12 Q. Hold on. Can you answer the question?
13 Wouldn't that be a worthwhile area for you to
14 look into?
15
MR. COTTON: Keith, he was in the process
16 of starting to answer the question.
17
MR. MITNIK: Yes, but he wasn't answering
18 my question.
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form. Go ahead
20 and answer.
21 A. The message is overwhelmingly being taken
22 to heart by the public that this is a cause of
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 lung cancer, and that is changing over time.
0082
1 Now, if the industry was trying to do something,
2 I don't see much evidence in the realm of public
3 opinion that it was having any effect. But I
4 didn't do research on what the industry was doing
5 in terms of what you said.
6 Q. Wouldn't that be a valid area of
7 investigation for you to look into what the
8 cigarette companies were agreeing to do and what
9 they were saying about the success of doing in
10 trying to create a controversy to reduce the
11 number of people who converted to believing
12 smoking caused lung cancer? Would that be an
13 area of valid investigation?
14
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
15 foundation.
16 A. Yes, but my investigation is public
17 awareness. So certainly it would be a valid area
18 for some historian to look into. There are all
19 kinds of topics out there that are valid.
20 Q. How about a valid area for you to look into
21 in this process?
22 A. I don't think so, because I am focusing on
23 the issue of public awareness, and I see
0083
1 tremendous increases in public awareness and
2 belief over time.
3 Q. And if the cigarette companies --
4 A. If they're trying that, they're not being
5 very successful.
6 Q. If the cigarette company had an actual plan
7 to affect public awareness as to whether this is
8 a controversial subject or a known fact, smoking
9 caused lung cancer, would that be an area for you
10 to investigate for the sake of knowing the whole
11 story?
12
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
13 foundation.
14 A. I think private companies have all sorts of
15 marketing plans, hula hoops, you name it. What
16 I'm interested in is what reached the public,
17 what was the level of public awareness and
18 belief, and how did that change over time; in
19 particular, what did Karen Whitney know, or what
20 would she have been exposed to in terms of
21 information about the dangers of smoking; from
22 her schooling, you know, from her experiences as
23 an adult, and so forth, newspapers and those
0084
1 kinds of things, family, friends.
2 Q. Move to strike, nonresponsive. I didn't
3 ask you a word about Karen Whitney.
4 A. Well, that's the case I've been working on,
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 so I'm sort of focused on it.
6 Q. Hold on, hold on. I would ask you to
7 please listen to my question and do your best to
8 answer the question asked. Madam Court Reporter,
9 will you read back my question?
10
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
11 portion of the testimony was read back by the
12 court reporter.)
13
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lacks
14 foundation, asked and answered.
15 A. My whole story is to find out what was the
16 level of public awareness, how did that change
17 out at the time? And I'm --
18 Q. Do you know --
19
MR. COTTON: He's in the middle of his
20 answer, Keith.
21 A. I'm not looking at the internal documents,
22 internal debates of the American Cancer Society
23 or groups, you know, like that. I'm not looking
0085
1 at the tobacco industry either. I'm looking at
2 what did the public know, what was out there,
3 what was the level of public awareness and belief
4 as measured in all sorts of sources including
5 polls.
6 Q. So would your answer be, "I would not
7 consider it a valid area of investigation for me,
8 as I have been hired in this case to look at what
9 the cigarette companies were up to in regard to
10 trying to affect public awareness"?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
12 mischaracterizes testimony.
13 A. I would not consider it important to get an
14 understanding of public awareness, dangers of
15 smoking.
16 Q. How about what cigarette companies --
17 A. What actually, you know, were they exposed
18 to, that's what I'm -- and that's a big job in
19 and of itself. It's a massively big job.
20 Q. And you want to gather from every source
21 you can indication -- strike that. Polling is
22 one measure of conversion from hearing something
23 and believing something, correct?
0086
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. Yes, just one of many. Exactly.
3 Q. My question is, it's not the sole source
4 but it is a good source, fair enough?
5
MR. COTTON: Objection to the form.
6 A. It can be a good source. Yes, it certainly
7 can.
8 Q. There are other sources of information,
9 correct?
10 A. Certainly.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 Q. Would you consider it a valid area for you
12 to investigate if in fact, hypothetically, there
13 are internal documents of the cigarette companies
14 expressing the success rate or the success of
15 them influencing public awareness regarding
16 people converting from having heard smoking
17 caused lung cancer into believing it?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection.
19 Q. If they internally looked into that
20 question and have conclusions in that regard,
21 would that be a valid source for you to look at?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
23 foundation.
0087
1 A. I think you could look at all sorts of
2 companies and they draw all sorts of internal
3 conclusions. To me, what matters is what
4 actually happens on the ground. That's my focus.
5 Q. So would your answer be, if there is data
6 available as to the cigarette companies'
7 conclusions in regard to the success of affecting
8 public awareness in the conversion from hearing
9 to believing about lung cancer threats, that
10 would not be an area that you would be interested
11 in looking at?
12
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
13 A. It certainly would to the extent it would
14 be poll data, which I have looked at.
15 Q. Other than poll data?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
17 Q. Would that be something you have no
18 interest in, or would you have interest in seeing
19 if it exists?
20
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
21 A. I think that you want to look at where the
22 rubber meets the road, right, what is going on;
23 and poll data commissioned by the companies would
0088
1 be, certainly, part of that. It could shed light
2 on things, although I've found it tended to just
3 corroborate what you would see in Gallup and
4 other polls.
5 Q. Other than polling data, if there's other
6 information in internal documents of cigarette
7 companies assessing the effectiveness of their
8 efforts in regard to the conversion of people
9 believing from hearing -- strike that. If there
10 are internal documents in the company assessing
11 the success of efforts to keep people from
12 believing smoking causes lung cancer, aside from
13 polls, is that something you just would have no
14 interest in seeing, or you would want to see?
15
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
16 foundation.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 A. I'm not as interested in what a particular
18 person in a particular position assesses or what
19 their interpretation is. You know, we see that
20 over the years, right, companies miscalculating.
21 I think there's plenty to do looking at what the
22 polls actually show about what are the levels of
23 belief, and we see over time declining numbers of
0089
1 uncertains, declining numbers of people saying,
2 "No, it doesn't cause lung cancer"; more people
3 being put it in the "yes" category year after
4 year after year. So that is pretty powerful.
5 And there are many, many polls that point in that
6 direction, repeatedly point in that direction.
7 Q. Are you telling me that "no," you have no
8 interest in internal assessments from the
9 cigarette companies as to the beliefs of their
10 customers regarding smoking causing lung cancer?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
12 Q. You have no interest in seeing those
13 documents?
14 A. Other than looking at poll data and other
15 than looking at what reaches the public --
16 Q. Wait, hold on --
17
MR. COTTON: Keith, hold on.
18 Q. Great. I withdraw the question. I'll save
19 time. Question withdrawn. New question. Are
20 you telling me you have no interest in seeing any
21 internal documents of cigarette companies
22 assessing the beliefs of their own customers as
23 to whether or not smoking does cause lung cancer?
0090
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. Other than the poll data, no.
3 Q. I want to go back. We were talking about
4 newsworthy. In the late 1970s, was the subject
5 of whether or not smoking caused lung cancer
6 still a newsworthy subject, or was it old news on
7 something that already had been decided?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection to the form.
9 A. I would say it's old news by that time.
10 Q. Would you agree in general when there is a
11 controversial subject that is no longer
12 controversial, you know, the mass of people, the
13 general public domain has reached its conclusion
14 as to it, that news agencies, newspapers, TV
15 stations don't cover it with fervor because it's
16 old news? They're interested in breaking news or
17 current events; is that correct?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, outside the
19 scope of your expertise.
20 A. I would say based on the newspaper
21 coverage, you know, over the years I tend to see
22 more and more coverage because there are more and
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 more studies not just on lung cancer but on other
0091
1 problems, other health issues related to
2 cigarette smoking. So you're getting a lot of
3 stuff reappearing over and over again and a lot
4 of new studies. There's a lot of money going
5 into doing research, I think, and that's being
6 reflected by news coverage.
7 Q. Have you watched, by any chance, the video
8 clip of Mr. Dwyer from the Tobacco Institute,
9 where he is talking about Califano in 1979 and
10 statements about cigarettes causing lung cancer
11 and other serious diseases?
12 A. I may have. I looked at the network, a lot
13 of the network coverage, news coverage, and I
14 certainly remember seeing clips about Califano
15 and the reaction to that. But as to a specific
16 name of an individual, you know, I'd have to go
17 back and look at those again.
18 Q. If someone from the tobacco industry in
19 1979 was going to stand up and suggest that
20 public health officials were being zealous to
21 suggest that smoking caused lung cancer or other
22 serious diseases, you would not expect that to be
23 a massively covered huge interest? Assuming
0092
1 there was no significant controversy left in
2 1979, was there?
3
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
4 A. I would not expect that to be significantly
5 covered, and in the greater news coverage it was
6 not. The tobacco industry response is getting
7 less and less coverage. Generally, their
8 argument is not that so much, although he may
9 have made that argument; it's "We haven't proven
10 it" -- "We need more research," "Association does
11 not equal causation." Those are kind of the key
12 arguments I see coming over and over again.
13 Q. So what would your explanation, then, be
14 for -- strike that. So you don't remember that
15 news conference with Dwyer from the tobacco
16 industry in 1979 criticizing Califano and there
17 being a bank of microphones just covering the
18 screen packed with news media from all over the
19 place?
20
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lacks
21 foundation, mischaracterizes testimony.
22 A. I remember somebody from the tobacco
23 industry, Tobacco Institute, criticizing
0093
1 Califano. But the details, how many microphones
2 there were, who he was specifically, it's been a
3 lot of years since I've looked at that particular
4 clip. I've looked at a lot of clips of the news
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 coverage, so I do remember vaguely about somebody
6 from the tobacco industry -- the Institute
7 responding to that.
8 Q. Did you see lots of news stories into the
9 '70s, '80s?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. Hold on. Lots of news stories still
12 discussing the subject of whether or not lung
13 cancer or other serious disease was caused by
14 smoking?
15 A. Very rarely by the time you're getting
16 there, but you do occasionally see them. But
17 news stories or the news article itself, that
18 would be the thesis of the article or the
19 argument, very, very rarely. You would still
20 occasionally see industry comment tend to be
21 buried towards the end of an article that it
22 tended to be saying, "This is the industry,"
23 right, that kind of thing. But as to the stories
0094
1 making that argument, very rarely.
2 Q. When do you think publications or
3 broadcasts became very rare on the subject of
4 telling the American people that smoking caused
5 lung cancer and serious disease?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
7 mischaracterizes testimony.
8 A. I would say it was always very rare. I
9 would say to the extent you got industry coverage
10 of the industry position, that that really starts
11 to -- that's diminishing over time, but it's
12 always a minority position.
13
MR. COTTON: Are you saying that the
14 industry response was a minority position?
15
THE WITNESS: Yes. I don't know what I
16 said.
17 Q. I'm not asking you about the industry
18 response.
19 A. Okay.
20 Q. I'm talking about the broadcast or
21 publication telling the viewers or readers that
22 smoking causes lung cancer and serious disease,
23 when did those taper off to where they were
0095
1 barely existent?
2 A. Oh, I don't think that they -- I don't see
3 much evidence -- my focus is really in the period
4 up until the 1980s. I don't really see a
5 drop-off. I just see, "Here is another thing
6 that tobacco did," and then they'll mention the
7 lung cancer and they'll emphasize things like,
8 "If you even smoke one cigarette, it's going to
9 do this damage." So they've become much more
10 specific and much stronger, but I don't see
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 evidence that tapers off.
12 Q. Are you anticipating at the trial having a
13 slide show showing all kinds of news about the
14 dangers of smoking?
15 A. Yes, I think I will.
16 Q. Do you have a pretty good idea of the types
17 of things that will be in there?
18 A. I haven't gone to trial, but I assume it
19 would include things about the history of --
20 Q. You don't need to tell me. I just want to
21 know, do you have a pretty good idea?
22 A. I have general ideas about the kinds of
23 things that might be in there.
0096
1 Q. So you're not going to be expecting to be
2 showing anything in the '70s and '80s that would
3 show the public health side still trying to
4 convince people that smoking caused lung cancer
5 or serious disease --
6
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
7 Q. -- because it's your conclusion most
8 everybody has already figured that out, and that
9 would be a waste of time?
10
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
11 mischaracterizes testimony.
12 Q. Am I right?
13 A. No. It's continually, you know, people are
14 growing up, new kids are growing up, and it's
15 continually being broadcast out there. And I
16 think it's important, because it just reinforces
17 it over the decades more and more.
18 Q. But it wasn't in your conclusion because
19 there was still controversy and they were still
20 trying to convince people of the danger? It
21 would only be for the young kids coming up that
22 maybe haven't heard the message yet; is that
23 correct?
0097
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to the form,
2 mischaracterizes testimony.
3 A. And new dangers that might result, new
4 health problems that might result, newer more
5 specific information.
6 Q. I want to try to make sure I have a crisp
7 answer. The only news into the '70s and '80s
8 where they were talking about the dangers of lung
9 cancer or other serious disease from smoking
10 would be directed either at a new generation that
11 may not have already heard it or about new
12 dangers or more specific dangers, not the general
13 subject of causing lung cancer or disease,
14 because that had already been -- the jury was
15 back on that, had already resolved that in the
16 public's eye, right?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
18 mischaracterizes his testimony.
19 A. It would certainly be reported, yet again,
20 you know, "Cigarette smoking causes lung cancer,
21 but here is a new thing we found out about how
22 early it will cause it"; and when you can quit,
23 you know, strategies to quit; you know, will it
0098
1 do damage if you're young, that kind of thing,
2 what kind of damage will it do. So filling out
3 the picture. A lot of new studies are being
4 done. But I think it is, by researchers, at
5 least by scientists, it is sort of in a sense
6 taken for granted, but it's like we haven't told
7 the full story here because there are a lot of
8 details here. We don't know yet. We're trying
9 to find out about the specifics, so there's a lot
10 on that, I think.
11 Q. But the public, according to your research,
12 by the '70s and '80s had already reached its
13 conclusion, smoking caused lung cancer?
14 A. Yes, in a general sense they had; but, you
15 know, there's always going to be more research
16 and it's going to look at new angles. We've
17 still got biographies being done of Teddy
18 Roosevelt, right, that will look at new angles,
19 even though we have a general picture of him
20 perhaps.
21 Q. Hang on.
22
MR. COTTON: Should we go off the record,
23 Keith?
0099
1
MR. MITNIK: Yes, we can go off the record.
2 I don't know what happened. This just dropped
3 off.
4
(Whereupon, at this time a short break was
5 taken.)
6 Q. Let's resume. Let's talk a minute about
7 these polls. First off, before we do that, are
8 you familiar with the phrase, from your
9 investigation, that there was a cancer scare in
10 and around the early '50s?
11 A. Yes, I've heard that expression. Yes.
12 Q. Did there appear to be a significant
13 increased level and concern about smoking causing
14 lung cancer that occurred around that time in
15 conjunction with reports about mice pain studies?
16 A. Yes, and other things that came out. Yes.
17 Yes.
18 Q. Have you seen the forwarding memorandum
19 from Hill & Knowlton from around Christmas Eve
20 1953 that was done with meetings from the heads
21 of most of the major cigarette companies?
22 A. No, I have not.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 Q. Have you heard about it?
0100
1 A. Again, when I read some of the research,
2 like Kluger, they in a general sense discussed
3 some of that, but that's been a lot of years.
4 Q. And you have no interest in looking at that
5 now?
6 A. Again, I'm interested in what the public
7 knew and what --
8 Q. Hold on. You're telling me what you're
9 interested in. I'm asking, but you have no
10 interest in that document? I'm not asking --
11 A. In that particular document?
12 Q. Yes.
13 A. No, not particularly, because I don't think
14 it bears on the topic. I have --
15
MR. COTTON: You have answered the
16 question.
17
THE WITNESS: All right.
18 Q. Did you look at anything about cigarette
19 consumption or sales leading up to this point in
20 time, the early 1950s?
21 A. To the extent that was reported in the
22 press and that would be reflected in poll data,
23 certainly I did look at that.
0101
1 Q. And had cigarette sales been skyrocketing
2 over the last fifty years leading up to that time
3 period?
4
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
5 A. Well, some of it is spotty, but certainly
6 by World War I, we were seeing a big increase,
7 and that continues.
8 Q. Was there a significant dip in sales, an
9 appreciable dip in sales or consumption of
10 cigarettes, in the early 1950s, with the, quote,
11 "cancer scare"?
12
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
13 A. You know, some of the poll data is spotty.
14 I know, just looking at it a few days ago, that
15 it did crest in '54. But for some of those years
16 before that, you know, they're not necessarily
17 doing regular polls, so I'm not terribly sure
18 what it had been before that and how that
19 compares with what it, you know, had been in '54.
20 But I know in '54, my memory I think is right on
21 this, that it was 45 percent. And it was in the
22 40s in the 1940s, but I think it was lower than
23 that, actually. So it may have gone up and then
0102
1 back up again. I don't know.
2 Q. In 1954, when do you say there was no real
3 debate or controversy left in whether or not
4 cigarette smoking caused cancer? What timeframe
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 do you say, "Now we've got a consensus from the
6 perspective of public awareness"?
7
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
8 A. I think that the preponderance of the
9 scientific community quite quickly, early '50s,
10 bought into this idea. I think there were still
11 some people, respected people who disagreed with
12 it. But I think, really, mid to late '50s.
13 Again, you know, I'm not doing the kind of
14 looking at the medical journals and that kind of
15 thing, but it seems like there are far fewer sort
16 of scientists, a lot of credentials that are
17 coming forward and saying, "Hey, I disagree with
18 this."
19 Q. How about the public domain in general, the
20 public awareness? Not scientists in
21 laboratories, the general public awareness of
22 Americans --
23
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
0103
1 Q. -- when do you say the subject of whether
2 smoking caused lung cancer was no longer a
3 controversial subject?
4
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
5 A. I would say -- it depends on what you mean
6 by controversial. If you look at what percentage
7 say they believe, I think you're talking about
8 late '60s it's something like 70 percent. And,
9 of course, a lot of the people that would be on
10 the other side are people that aren't convinced
11 yet, in addition to people that are just saying
12 no. So there are people that aren't convinced
13 yet. And I would say that, you know, by the
14 1980s or so, it's getting pretty much close to
15 universal saying, "Yes, it does." And that
16 undecided group and that "no" group has dropped
17 off.
18 Q. Your understanding from your research, what
19 happened in the early '50s that increased
20 people's concern about the dangers of smoking
21 cigarettes?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
23 A. Well, there were statistical studies; there
0104
1 were studies by doctors, pathology, that kind of
2 thing; people like Wynder and Graham, their work
3 came out in 1950 from the American side showing
4 an association. There were people like Hammond
5 showing statistical association, and then there
6 were scientists in England again showing
7 evidence, like Doll and Hill. So '49, '50,
8 you're really getting a lot of work coming out on
9 lung cancer, and that just builds over time.
10 Q. And from your investigation, did that take
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 a general concern that cigarettes may be bad for
12 your health and increase the level of public
13 concern or awareness with a specific disease
14 being linked, through doctors and publications
15 that were making the public, to lung cancer?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
17 A. It certainly enhanced the menu of things
18 that could be regarded as deadly, as dangerous.
19 But if you look at the message being communicated
20 through high school textbooks, and so forth, in
21 the period before that it's very much emphasized
22 that this could shorten your life; it could kill
23 you. You have expressions like "coffin nail"
0105
1 already being out there, "cancer stick" in the
2 '50s, certainly, being out there. So that
3 perception that this is deadly goes all the way
4 back to the beginning of cigarettes.
5 Q. So basically, you would not, from your
6 investigation, conclude that when we got to the
7 early 1950s, that there was any significant
8 change at all in public awareness as to the
9 deadliness of cigarettes, that it was consistent?
10 A. I think it takes it to a new level. So is
11 there change? I would say it probably does take
12 it to a new level. Lung cancer, as people find
13 out about it, is, you know, very scary, right?
14 But it was already out there in a big way, being
15 communicated to the public that this is a deadly
16 habit; it could take years off your life. You
17 had Raymond Pearl do a study in the late '30s,
18 for example, which was picked up by the media and
19 a lot of the textbooks showing that cigarette
20 smokers didn't live as long as other people do.
21 Q. What do you mean "take this to a new
22 level"? What does that mean?
23 A. Of just specificity of, oh, boy, this is a
0106
1 specific disease, that cigarette smoking is a
2 horrible disease, and a lot more information
3 about that.
4 Q. And what's the difference between -- when
5 you use the word "deadly," it's your
6 understanding smoking kills you, it can kill you?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. What's the difference between "smoking can
9 kill you" and "smoking can cause cancer that can
10 kill you"?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
12 A. Well, other than more detail, more
13 specifics, you know, about the kind of death you
14 would suffer.
15 Q. And before the early '50s where there was
16 this taking to a new level because of lung
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 cancer, what do you say everyone thought was
18 going to kill them from cigarettes before? How
19 were they going to die from your investigation?
20
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
21 A. Well, cancer in a general sense is
22 certainly emphasized; heart conditions is
23 something you see a lot; you see that it could
0107
1 cause amputations from circulatory problems, that
2 kind of thing.
3 Q. And what about cancer?
4 A. Certainly, cancer is out there from the
5 beginning as one of the dangers of smoking. You
6 know, President Grant, when he died there was a
7 lot of commentary on the fact that he died from
8 cancer because of his smoking.
9 Q. What kind of cancer, from your -- what
10 would you tell the jury, before 1950, what your
11 investigation says the public was aware that
12 smoking caused cancer, what kind?
13 A. What cancer?
14 Q. What kind of cancer?
15 A. Well, certainly you do see work arguing
16 lung cancer, but you see stomach cancer, I've
17 seen that mentioned. A whole kind of -- mouth
18 cancer, I've seen that, and then a lot of
19 emphasis on the heart, bad for the heart, bad for
20 the heart conditions.
21 Q. Okay. Was there any controversy in the
22 1930s --
23 A. Well --
0108
1
MR. COTTON: Hold on. Were you finished
2 with your question?
3
MR. MITNIK: Yes.
4 Q. Was there any controversy before 1950 about
5 whether or not smoking caused lung cancer?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 Q. Or is that a matter of public awareness,
8 everybody pretty much knew that?
9 A. You know, a lot of it was taken for
10 granted. Like you will see in Three Stooges, you
11 know, where they had the Coffin Nail Cigarette
12 Company and they won a prize for it, or
13 commentary in the movies. I don't see a lot of
14 examples of people saying, "Gee, this isn't going
15 to do me any harm." To the extent I see it, it's
16 negative. When they discuss the health issue,
17 anyway, it's negative. I've not seen a lot of
18 people say, "Gee, I don't think it's bad for
19 you."
20 Q. From your investigation, why -- are you
21 still there?
22 A. Yes.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 Q. I heard a click.
0109
1
(Off-the-record discussion.)
2
(Whereupon, at this time a lunch break was
3 taken.)
4 Q. I think where we left off, we were talking
5 about before the early 1950s, that you would tell
6 the jury that there was a general public
7 awareness that smoking was powerfully addictive
8 and deadly and cancer-causing, am I right?
9 A. Certainly, that it was deadly. I think
10 cancer was one of many things that were
11 identified as aspects, you know, that could kill
12 you. So I would say deadly, yes.
13 Q. I want to make a distinction between
14 something you may have read here and there and
15 what I understand you're using the term "public
16 awareness."
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. Was there a general public awareness,
19 according to you in your research, before the
20 1950s that smoking caused cancer?
21 A. I don't know if I would go that far. I
22 think there was a general awareness that smoking
23 could shorten your life, that it was a deadly
0110
1 habit, and that it was very much habit-forming.
2 As to whether cancer was singled out, you know, I
3 think there were a lot of health problems that
4 were identified from smoking, and that was one.
5 Q. How about before the 1950s -- let me back
6 up. Would you say at the turn of the century,
7 there was general public awareness that smoking
8 would kill you?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection.
10 Q. Could kill you?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
12 A. I would say so. We already have terms such
13 as "coffin nails" just becoming common
14 occurrence; and we have a lot of stories about
15 cigarette feigns and, you know, that it could
16 kill you.
17 Q. How about at the turn of the century that
18 there was general public awareness that based on
19 the experience that smokers reported in the
20 matters you reviewed, that smoking was powerfully
21 addictive?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
23 A. Yes. I mean, you are getting terms around
0111
1 that time, such as "little white slaver," and
2 terms like "addiction." "Addiction" is certainly
3 used quite a lot in the popular media.
4 Q. Did cigarettes get banned in states as part
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 of the, kind of, fallout from the prohibition and
6 the temperance movement?
7
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
8 A. Yes, it did. It got banned in several
9 states.
10 Q. Do you know how many?
11 A. Oh, I think we're talking about -- just a
12 guess, I think twenty-something states, maybe.
13 Q. From your investigation, how did they get
14 out of that? How did they get back to being
15 legal in those twenty states?
16 A. I think that -- I think your linking it
17 with prohibition makes a lot of sense. I think
18 there was a general feeling that developed over
19 time that it's hard to enforce a law like this,
20 more of an emphasis on putting restrictions in
21 for youth, that sort of -- a general sense that
22 prohibition wasn't going to work, and also a
23 sense, too, "We've tried this prohibition. We've
0112
1 got enough on our hands here without trying
2 another one."
3 Q. In your investigation, did you reach any
4 conclusion as to how it was that mainstream
5 America was using -- such a high percentage of
6 Americans were using a product that there was
7 public awareness was highly addictive and killed?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
9 A. Again, I haven't studied, you know, the
10 psychology of why people made the decisions they
11 did. Perhaps there was a fatalism in that era
12 that maybe didn't exist later, but I haven't
13 really studied that enough to say. I know that
14 might be one possibility.
15 Q. What do you mean "fatalism"?
16 A. Oh, again, I'm just speculating. People
17 thinking, "Oh, life is short anyway." You know,
18 "Life is nasty, brutish, and short; we're not
19 going to live long anyway," that kind of thing.
20
MR. COTTON: Mr. Mitnik doesn't want you to
21 speculate.
22
THE WITNESS: Okay.
23 Q. So would the answer be minus speculation --
0113
1 A. Speculation.
2 Q. Would the answer be you've done no
3 investigation to explain why so many Americans
4 would have been doing something if indeed there
5 was a public awareness that it would kill you and
6 was highly addictive?
7
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
8 A. No investigation of that issue per se.
9 Q. How about let's move past the early 1950s
10 and forward. Did you do any investigation to see
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 why, if there was indeed general public awareness
12 that smoking caused lung cancer and was deadly
13 and highly addictive, why so many people
14 continued to both take it up and continue to
15 smoke?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
17 A. Again, that's not an area I really looked
18 at as part of my research.
19 Q. Did you look to see what cigarette
20 companies were doing that may have an impact on
21 why so many people were still picking up
22 cigarettes, even though according to you, there
23 was a general public awareness that it can cause
0114
1 lung cancer and was highly addictive?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
3 A. Again, I certainly looked at ads, and I
4 looked at poll data about people's opinions of
5 cigarette smoking -- cigarette companies. But
6 other than that, no, I didn't look at that issue
7 as such. I focused on awareness. That's the
8 issue, awareness and belief about the health
9 dangers of smoking in the general public. There
10 was plenty to do with that.
11 Q. From your investigation, what were the
12 percentage of people that believed smoking caused
13 lung cancer before the early 1950s?
14
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
15 A. Well, we don't really have any poll data
16 from that period. We know that there were polls
17 about harmfulness, whether or not it's harmful,
18 but even very few of those. It's hard to say,
19 based on the lack of poll data.
20 Q. When did the polling start in earnest?
21
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
22 A. I would say it really starts in earnest in
23 the mid '50s.
0115
1 Q. And didn't the polling show somewhere in
2 the ballpark of 50 percent of people in the mid
3 '50s believed that smoking caused lung cancer?
4
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
5 A. Yes. 40, 50, yes, and then moving up.
6
(Off-the-record discussion.)
7 Q. Did those polls show a significant
8 difference in the belief of whether lung cancer
9 was caused by smoking, between smokers and
10 nonsmokers?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, vague.
12 A. Smokers -- fewer smokers said that they
13 believed, a smaller percentage.
14 Q. Wasn't that about twenty percent difference
15 in general, average, between smokers and
16 nonsmokers through the '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
18 foundation, calls for speculation.
19 A. What I would see, it would usually be less.
20 Maybe, you know, you might have 50 percent of the
21 public in general, and then smokers might be
22 closer to 40. But those are just sort of rough
23 guesses based on my memory.
0116
1 Q. Well, roughly, if you took the whole and
2 then looked only at the smokers, the smokers
3 tended to be about ten percent less than the
4 number for the whole when it came to believing
5 lung cancer was caused by smoking, right?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 A. Yes, I would say roughly that's correct.
8 But again, I would need to re-review the polls to
9 be more precise, but that sounds about right.
10 Q. If there was a general acceptance at the
11 turn of the century that smoking would kill you,
12 how do you account for only 50 percent of all
13 people and 40 percent of smokers in the '50s
14 believed it caused lung cancer?
15
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
16 A. Well, it killed you in other ways. If you
17 see polls on harmfulness, that gets up to
18 70 percent in the '50s, then by the mid '60s it's
19 up to 90 percent.
20 Q. Yes, but harmful doesn't mean it kills you,
21 does it?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
23 Q. Not necessarily?
0117
1
MR. COTTON: Calls for speculation.
2 Q. That's not what they're told?
3
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, vague,
4 calls for speculation.
5 A. Yes. Again, I would be speculating on
6 that. I certainly know that the message was
7 being communicated in many venues that it
8 shortens your life, coffin nails, you know, it's
9 going to kill you.
10 Q. Hold on. You're moving into other things.
11 I'm talking about polls only, not coffin nails
12 and Smoke Smoke Smoke, and all that stuff. I'm
13 talking about polls. When someone polls it's
14 harmful, that includes it short -- cuts your wind
15 so you don't have as good wind if you're an
16 athlete; it makes you cough; it can make your
17 throat scratchy. All of that's included in the
18 subject "could be bad for your health," correct?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
20 foundation, calls for speculation.
21 A. Again, I would be speculating about what
22 that means, because I don't know to what extent
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 the pollsters had a clear definition of what that
0118
1 means, if they laid it out, if they had a clear
2 standard.
3 Q. When I talk about those polls that talked
4 about being harmful to your health, the answer
5 is, you don't know whether they were polling it
6 would shorten your life or kill you?
7 A. They didn't ask that specific -- I didn't
8 see questions asked about that specific issue.
9 Q. Now, let's move to what do you account that
10 only 50 percent of the people in general and
11 40 percent of the smokers believed smoking would
12 cause lung cancer in the polls in the '50s?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection.
14 Q. How come it isn't more, if everybody knew
15 all this at the turn of the century?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, calls for
17 speculation.
18 A. It's a specific issue, and the literature
19 was very recent, and it took time for people to
20 take it all in, and there was still something of
21 a debate in the early '50s. But you're seeing a
22 very rapid movement, very rapid movement in
23 belief levels over time. I think you could view
0119
1 it as really quite rapid. You could view it from
2 that perspective, not that it's going slow.
3 Q. Roughly, how many Americans were there in
4 the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s?
5
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
6 A. This is just guessing. I mean, I guess in
7 the '50s there were maybe about 120,000,000
8 130,000,000 people.
9 Q. How about in the '80s?
10 A. '80s, what, 200,000,000-plus.
11 Q. So you would say very rapidly there became
12 a virtual "everybody knew it would kill you"?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
14 Q. Cancer?
15 A. I think it was part of the culture long
16 before that, you know, coffin nails, all the
17 slang expressions.
18 Q. I withdraw the question. You would say
19 very quickly the polls showed that everybody
20 accepted and believed smoking caused lung cancer.
21 Have I got that right?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
23 mischaracterizes testimony.
0120
1 A. I would say that the polls show a rapid
2 movement in that direction over time. So we're
3 talking more the '70s and '80s when it becomes
4 close to universal. But it's rapidly moving in
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 that direction. And the people saying "no" on
6 the doubters rapidly diminish.
7 Q. Actually, sir, wasn't it the '90s before it
8 got to be where you were up into the 90 percent
9 believed it? It wasn't until the '90s?
10
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
11 A. Again, I'd have to review the poll data
12 again.
13 Q. Well, you're the expert. You can't answer
14 the question that it wasn't until -- you're the
15 one that told me very rapidly, very rapidly.
16
MR. COTTON: Keith, if you're asking --
17 Q. Are you telling me --
18
MR. COTTON: What he said was, if you're
19 asking about specific numbers, he would need to
20 look at the data.
21
MR. MITNIK: I don't want you to tell me
22 what he said. Hold on. I don't want you to
23 testify for him.
0121
1
MR. COTTON: That's what he said. I'm
2 repeating what he just said.
3
MR. MITNIK: Well, you don't need to repeat
4 what he just said.
5
MR. COTTON: Well, perhaps you didn't hear
6 it.
7 Q. Are you telling me you don't know, as you
8 sit here as the expert that has come into this
9 case, when the polling showed that 90 percent of
10 Americans believed lung cancer was caused by
11 smoking?
12
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
13 A. I would need to review the polls, but I
14 know it was rapidly moving in that direction. By
15 the '80s, it was getting up there, '70s, '80s,
16 you know. And then the numbers of "no's" is
17 rapidly declining as well.
18 Q. Well, would you agree, sir, that if it
19 took -- would you say 90 is getting close to
20 almost everybody?
21 A. Yes, it certainly is, and you have even
22 more people regard it as a bad habit that is
23 dangerous, harmful.
0122
1 Q. I'm not asking about a bad habit. We're
2 not talking about bad habits.
3 A. Dangerous habit.
4 Q. Would you agree that 90 is when you pretty
5 much have a consensus where when you're north of
6 90, you're in virtually everyone believes it's
7 causing lung cancer?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
9 A. I am not an expert on polls. That sounds
10 pretty close to a consensus to me, though.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 Q. Assume for me that the polling numbers on
12 that were not until 1990.
13
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
14 A. And I need to review the polls.
15 Q. Assume for me that.
16
MR. COTTON: To be clear, what are we
17 assuming?
18
MR. MITNIK: We're assuming that it was not
19 until 1990 that the polls reached into the
20 90 percent.
21
MR. COTTON: 90 percent? Objection to
22 form, vague.
23 Q. To what do you attribute it would take that
0123
1 long to have a virtual consensus when you started
2 at around 40 percent in -- let me back up. Do
3 you agree that the number in 1954, or thereabout,
4 of people that believed it caused lung cancer,
5 according to Gallup, was about 40 percent in
6 1954?
7
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
8 A. That sounds about right.
9 Q. And the number of smokers would have been
10 approximately 10 percent less than that?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
12 A. Probably about right, yes.
13 Q. Let's move forward a decade. Do you know
14 where it was a decade later?
15
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
16 A. I believe it gets up to around 70 percent
17 by the late '60s.
18
MR. COTTON: He's not asking you to guess.
19
THE WITNESS: I know. That's just a guess.
20 A. You know, I need to have the stuff in front
21 of me to look at it.
22 Q. Just assume for me that in the mid '60s
23 it's about 60 percent and about 10 percent less
0124
1 for nonsmokers, all right?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
3 A. Again, I don't have the polling data in
4 front of me.
5 Q. Okay. That doesn't sound off, does it?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection.
7 Q. You're the expert that's looked at all
8 this, and you've referred to polls over and over
9 and you've said repeatedly that it happened
10 rapidly. Are you not ready to answer these
11 questions today?
12
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
13 mischaracterizes his testimony. He has said it
14 already a couple times now, if you want to have
15 specific numbers, he'll have to look at the
16 numbers.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 Q. Is that your answer? "I'm comfortable
18 saying it happened rapidly, but if you're going
19 to ask me what the numbers were along the way, I
20 can't answer that without looking at the polls."
21 Is that your answer?
22 A. To be precise, I'd have to do that. That
23 doesn't sound too far off, what you said, based
0125
1 on my memory of the polls.
2 Q. So we now have the cancer scare in the
3 early '50s, and we've started out with about
4 40 percent of people thinking or believing it
5 caused cancer, and about 10 percent less for the
6 smokers. If we move about a decade later and now
7 we're into the mid '60s, and assume for me it's
8 now only at 60 percent, with about 10 percent
9 less for the smokers. So we're at about 50-50
10 for the smokers. Does that jibe with your
11 investigation that half of the smokers in America
12 by the mid '60s still were not convinced that
13 smoking caused lung cancer?
14
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
15 A. They were convinced it was harmful.
16 Q. That's not my question, sir. Please quit
17 changing my question, honestly.
18
MR. COTTON: Keith, he's not changing the
19 question. He's answering your question.
20
MR. MITNIK: No, he is not. When I asked
21 about cancer and he changes it, the first thing
22 out of his mouth is "They knew it could be
23 harmful," that does not answer my question.
0126
1 A. Which would include cancer, it would
2 include various kinds of cancer.
3 Q. The question is simple. Does that jibe
4 with what you're planning to tell this jury in
5 your investigation, that half of the smokers in
6 America in the mid '60s were still not convinced
7 that smoking caused lung cancer?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
9 A. They were either convinced that the
10 evidence wasn't quite there yet or they didn't
11 think it would or did.
12 Q. So you would agree that about half of the
13 smokers in America in the mid '60s still were not
14 convinced that smoking caused lung cancer? Do
15 you agree?
16 A. Again, you're asking me to speculate, and I
17 don't have the polls in front of me so it's all
18 speculation. I need to have the polls in front
19 of me to look them over carefully. I don't have
20 them in front of me.
21 Q. Does that square with your investigation in
22 general for that timeframe?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
0127
1 A. I really would need to look at the poll
2 data.
3 Q. So it was your impression that in the mid
4 '60s, virtually all smokers believed that it
5 would -- and I'm not limiting it to the polls.
6 Your entire investigation, that virtually all
7 smokers in the mid '60s were convinced that
8 smoking caused lung cancer?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
10 A. No, I never said that. No.
11 Q. You would agree that a significant
12 percentage of smokers in the mid '60s were still
13 not convinced that smoking caused lung cancer?
14 A. Yes, but they were convinced that it was
15 harmful; that it caused other problems, heart
16 problems, emphysema, other kinds of cancer.
17 Q. Really? Your review of the polling data
18 would show you that people became convinced
19 sooner that smoking caused heart disease and
20 emphysema than they were convinced that it caused
21 cancer? That was your conclusion?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
23 mischaracterizes his testimony.
0128
1 A. There's a wide menu over time of health
2 problems that are identified with smoking. So it
3 would depend on the particular individual as to
4 what particular kind of thing they would
5 emphasize. Or just generally that it's going to
6 shorten their life, that it's a coffin nail, it's
7 a cancer stick, that it's going to shorten their
8 life, that it's going to kill them.
9 Q. Sir, you just said to me, "No, they were
10 not," a significant number were not aware that it
11 would cause lung cancer, but they were aware it
12 would cause heart disease and emphysema.
13
MR. COTTON: Objection.
14 Q. My follow-up question is, do you believe --
15 A. Or cancer, other kinds of cancer.
16 Q. Do you believe that people became
17 convinced, according to the polls, sooner about
18 heart disease being caused by smoking than when
19 they became convinced that lung cancer was caused
20 by smoking?
21 A. No, that is not my testimony. Just a menu
22 of different health problems were identified with
23 smoking.
0129
1 Q. Okay. Let's go back to it. Your overall
2 assessment was that a significant number, up to
3 half of the smokers in the mid '60s were still
4 not convinced that smoking caused lung cancer; is
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 that correct?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 A. Again, it's spec- -- I really would like to
8 have the poll data in front of me to speak
9 authoritatively, somewhat authoritatively about
10 it.
11 Q. So as we sit here today, you can't tell me
12 whether or not a significant number, as much as
13 50 percent of the smokers in the mid '60s, still
14 were not convinced that smoking caused lung
15 cancer, right?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
17 A. There were a lot of people that were not
18 convinced yet that it caused lung cancer. But I
19 would want to review the polls to get a sense of
20 the percentages.
21 Q. Now let's move into the '70s, another
22 decade later. I'm now moving from the mid '60s
23 into the mid '70s. Are you aware from your view
0130
1 that the polls indicate around, in the ballpark
2 of 70 percent of people as a whole, and about
3 10 percent less than that of smokers, were now
4 finally convinced that smoking caused lung
5 cancer? Did you know that?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 A. Again, I need to have the poll data in
8 front of me. I certainly know that the
9 progression is rapidly moving up into the "yes"
10 category.
11 Q. So if you assume that the number of smokers
12 who believed it, now into the mid '70s, is in the
13 ballpark of about 60 percent --
14 A. Again, I would like to have poll data in
15 front of me.
16 Q. Just assume it for me. Would you call that
17 rapid if we started out with nonsmokers at about
18 30 percent in the mid '50s, and we're now up two
19 decades later --
20 A. You said nonsmokers in the '50s?
21 Q. I'm sorry. Smokers in the '50s were around
22 30 percent, and it had gotten to around
23 60 percent in two decades, leaving approximately
0131
1 40 percent of smokers in America still weren't
2 convinced, you would characterize that, assuming
3 that to be correct, as rapid?
4
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
5 A. I would. And even more rapid, I think, the
6 percentages saying it's harmful. That has just
7 skyrocketed over time.
8 Q. Really? When did harmful skyrocket?
9 A. Harmful was 60 percent in 1949, and then by
10 the mid '60s, according to the national
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 clearinghouse, I believe it was in the range of
12 90 percent.
13 Q. So you do know those polling data?
14 A. I don't have a photographic memory, but --
15 Q. But you remember those polling data?
16 A. I remember that the percentages in the mid
17 '50s, I remember in a general sense it was moving
18 up rapidly.
19 Q. Okay. But you don't know --
20 A. And the levels of awareness were post
21 90 percent in the '50s.
22 Q. But in 1949 -- what year did you say it was
23 49 percent that it could be harmful?
0132
1 A. I think it was something around 1949.
2
MR. COTTON: I'll object to the form.
3 Q. Okay. In 1949 you're telling us that only
4 half of Americans believed smoke to be harmful?
5
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
6 mischaracterizes his testimony --
7 Q. According to the polls?
8 A. It's 60 percent, including the majority of
9 smokers.
10 Q. And with the smokers, it was about
11 50 percent?
12 A. I think I remember 51, 52 percent, in that
13 range.
14 Q. So I thought you told me that everybody
15 knew it could be harmful since the turn of the
16 century. Did I hear that wrong?
17 A. Well, there could be -- I mean, there's a
18 lot of folks who were, you know, in the uncertain
19 category, and a lot of those folks, you know, it
20 might not show up in a poll necessarily. They
21 may believe there's a level of harm, but it may
22 be a certain threshold. Maybe they're not
23 familiar with the science on it.
0133
1 Q. Bottom line is, according to the poll that
2 you've just cited me, in 1949 around 50 percent
3 of the smokers did not believe smoking caused
4 them harm?
5 A. No. They were either unconvinced, you
6 know, or they did not believe it. So a lot of
7 them were not convinced that it did. Or that it
8 had been scientifically -- they didn't perhaps
9 feel qualified to comment on the science.
10 Q. How do you swear virtually everybody had
11 public awareness that smoking was bad for your
12 health at the turn of the century, but fifty
13 years later a poll shows that only 60 percent of
14 Americans thought it was, quote, "bad for your
15 health," and around 50 percent of smokers?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 Q. How do you square those two opinions?
18 A. Sure. Polls are one source among many, but
19 you could certainly look at popular culture,
20 expressions that are taken for granted, comments
21 in the movies, comments in the news. And when
22 those comments discuss whether or not it's bad
23 for you, overwhelmingly they're stating it's bad
0134
1 for you in one form or another. That's the
2 message that's being communicated. You look at
3 high school textbooks, you look at junior high
4 textbooks, overwhelmingly that's the message. I
5 don't see anybody saying, "Oh, gee, it's not bad
6 for you." People say, "We're not convinced that
7 it causes" this particular problem or that
8 particular problem, but the emphasis is on harm
9 over and over again.
10 Q. So an overwhelming message is not the same
11 thing as people believing, correct?
12 A. No, not necessarily. No, they would not
13 necessarily be the same thing.
14 Q. In fact, the polls showed like 90 percent
15 of people had heard, heard, smoking could be bad
16 for you, right?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
18 A. No, it could cause lung cancer.
19 Q. Could cause lung cancer. So 90 percent had
20 heard it in the early '50s, but only 40 percent
21 believed it. So there's a substantial gap often
22 between hearing and believing, correct?
23 A. Yes --
0135
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. -- true, and the gap is narrowing quite
3 rapidly over time.
4
MR. COTTON: If you would allow me to
5 object before you answer.
6
THE WITNESS: Sure.
7 Q. When you said virtually everybody believed
8 that smoking was harmful to your health at the
9 turn of the century, the polling data is contrary
10 to that, correct?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
12 foundation.
13 A. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't say that. I mean,
14 you have a lot of people that might not have --
15 you know, might have said they were uncertain
16 because they weren't -- they didn't feel that
17 they understood the science enough. They might
18 have felt it was bad for them, but they didn't
19 understand the science and feel qualified to
20 comment on it.
21 Q. Well, now, aren't you stating -- a moment
22 ago when we talked about the polls, you told me
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 that would be speculating what the pollster
0136
1 meant. Wouldn't that be speculating?
2 A. No, it would be informed opinion based on
3 what you see communicated over and over again in
4 the popular culture, and in textbooks and by the
5 scientific community. There's all sorts of
6 sources out there. Polling data is really one of
7 many sources.
8 Q. Are you discounting the polling data --
9 A. No, no.
10 Q. -- that you just cited to me in 1949 that
11 said approximately 50 percent of smokers were
12 convinced that smoking was harmful to their
13 health? Are you now discounting that poll you
14 just cited?
15
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
16 A. No, I'm not discounting it. It's one
17 source among many. And it indicates --
18 Q. Well --
19
MR. COTTON: He's in the middle of an
20 answer.
21 A. It indicates people that are willing to go
22 on the record and say, "Hey, you know, I think
23 this is harmful." Even the majority of smokers
0137
1 are saying that, at a time when nearly half the
2 population is smoking, half the adult population.
3 Q. Okay. Which position do you stand by, turn
4 of the century virtually everyone believed
5 smoking was harmful to them, or in 1949 only half
6 of the smokers were convinced it was harmful,
7 believed it was harmful to them? Which of those
8 positions are you going to be taking at trial?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
10 A. I stand by the position that it was widely
11 believed in the general population that smoking
12 was bad for you. And there's not just polling
13 data, there's all sorts of other sources that
14 back that up from the period. Uh --
15 Q. What percentage would you put on it? What
16 does "widely" mean?
17
MR. COTTON: Were you finished with your
18 answer?
19 Q. When you said "widely accepted," what does
20 that mean?
21
MR. COTTON: Excuse me. Were you finished
22 with your last answer?
23 Q. "Widely accepted," is that 50 percent,
0138
1 90 percent, 100 percent, 2 percent? What does
2 "widely accepted" mean to you?
3
MR. COTTON: One second. Can you read back
4 the last answer, please? Question and answer.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
6 portion of the testimony was read back by the
7 court reporter.)
8 A. Well, I don't think there's enough
9 information to give it a precise number, but I
10 just know it was taken for granted in the
11 culture, expressions such as "coffin nail."
12 Every comment I see, nearly every comment I see
13 is, to the extent it even mentions the health
14 issue, emphasizes it's bad for you. That would
15 indicate, I don't know about universal but a
16 significant, overwhelming percentage of the
17 population, when they discuss it, when it is
18 discussed in popular culture and other sources,
19 it's emphasizing heart.
20
MR. COTTON: Keith, just to make this run
21 more smoothly, I think it's helpful to give him
22 an opportunity to finish the answer before
23 jumping into your next one.
0139
1 Q. When you say "widely believed," I'm not
2 asking you about discussed. I'm talking about
3 widely believed. Do you understand the
4 difference between discussion and belief? Do you
5 understand the differences?
6 A. Between discussion and belief?
7 Q. Yes.
8 A. If somebody uses the expression "coffin
9 nail," that's pretty powerful to me, expression.
10 Q. Do you understand -- I move to strike, and
11 I'm about to take this to the judge. When I ask
12 you do you understand the difference between
13 believe, widely believed and widely discussed,
14 when you start the answer out "coffin nails,"
15 that can't possibly be responsive to that
16 question. Do you understand the difference
17 between widely believed and widely discussed, yes
18 or no?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
20 A. I understand that it was widely believed
21 from -- it was taken for granted whenever the
22 issue came up.
23 Q. I'm asking you a general question. Do you
0140
1 understand the distinction between widely
2 discussed and widely believed?
3 A. I'm not sure there is necessarily a
4 distinction. It would depend on the particular
5 case.
6 Q. Okay. "Discussed" is "believed" in your
7 mind?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection.
9 Q. If people discuss a subject a lot, then it
10 must be believed by everybody?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
12 mischaracterizes his testimony.
13 A. If the discussion states an opinion, I
14 would say that indicates belief.
15 Q. By the person stating it, correct?
16 A. Yes, uh-huh. And if that's all you see.
17 It's very powerful evidence.
18 Q. ***It sounds to me like you're telling me
19 that by -- at the turn of the century, and
20 certainly by 1949, virtually everyone believed
21 smoking was bad for you, bad for your health?
22 A. ***Well, certainly Karen Whitney's parents
23 believed it. She did not smoke around them. And
0141
1 I think that that was replicated in millions of
2 homes where it was just something you don't do,
3 you shouldn't do it.
4
MR. MITNIK: Mark that, please, Madam Court
5 Reporter.
6 A. And I think that that is one powerful
7 indicator of how widespread this belief was, that
8 it's bad for you, you shouldn't do it.
9 Q. When you say "widespread belief," do you
10 mean close to 90 percent?
11 A. I don't have a percentage that I could
12 assign to it. You know, it's not that precise.
13 Q. Would widespread belief include 50 percent?
14
MR. COTTON: He just said he doesn't have a
15 number.
16 Q. I'm not asking for your number. Would it
17 include 50 percent? To be widespread, would it
18 include -- if they were 50-50, would that be
19 widespread?

MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
21 A. I would say no. I would say more than
22 that, but I don't have a precise number. You
23 know, we have a shortage of statistical evidence.
0142
1 Q. If it was 75 percent believed it and 25
2 didn't, would that be widespread?
3
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
4 A. Again, I'm not a statistician, I'm not a
5 pollster, so I don't know how they would define
6 that.
7 Q. I'm not asking how they would. I'm asking
8 how you would.
9 A. I'm not an expert in that.
10 Q. Hold on, I'm not done. In your definition
11 when you say "widespread," would that include
12 25 percent of the people don't believe it?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
14 A. So widespread that it seems to be taken for
15 granted whenever the subject comes up, that's
16 widespread. The precise number, again, I don't
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 have a precise number that I can throw out to
18 you.
19 Q. I'm asking you whether with that definition
20 where it's taken for granted, include 25 percent
21 of the people don't believe it, would that rise
22 to the level of it's taken for granted as
23 widespread, in your discretion?
0143
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. That's outside of my area. I don't know
3 how pollsters define these things. I'm not a
4 pollster. I believe there's some sort of
5 standard.
6 Q. I'm not asking you about a poll. I'm
7 asking you if 75 percent of the people believed
8 it and 25 didn't, would that meet your definition
9 of widespread belief?
10
MR. COTTON: Objection to the form.
11 A. If this is purely a hypothetical, sure,
12 that would be widespread.
13 Q. But 50 percent, 50-50 would not be under
14 your definition?
15
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
16 A. I'm a layman. I'm not an expert on polls.
17 Q. I'm not asking you about polls. I'm asking
18 you, if 50 percent of Americans believed
19 something and 50 didn't, would you consider that
20 widespread belief?
21 A. Again, you're asking me as somebody that's
22 not an expert on polls about, you know, what I
23 say is widespread and what isn't. My guess is as
0144
1 good as a lot of folks, I guess, about that.
2 Q. Is the bottom line -- just hear the
3 question. When you use the word "widespread,"
4 would it include half of the people believe it,
5 your answer would be what?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 A. Again, the same answer as before. I don't
8 really feel qualified. I'm not a pollster, to
9 what their standards would be and what is
10 widespread and what isn't widespread, et cetera.
11 Q. So if I stand up in front of the jury and
12 ask you this question, "Sir, you would include --
13 if half of America believed something and half
14 didn't, you would consider that to be widespread
15 belief," your answer is going to be "Yes, I do,"
16 or "No, I don't," or "I can't answer the
17 question"?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
19 A. No. I was saying the sources of
20 information indicating that, you know, it's
21 widespread goes far beyond the polls and include
22 popular culture. Whenever this subject is
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 brought up, I just don't see people saying, "Gee,
0145
1 that's not bad for me." I don't see that happen
2 very often. I see overwhelmingly the other side
3 that indicates almost a consensus, something bad
4 here. Parents prohibit it like Ms. Whitney's
5 parents prohibited it for a reason. They didn't
6 want their kids smoking.
7 Q. I'm going to try again. If I ask you in
8 front of the jury when you used the phrase "It
9 was widespread belief," and I ask, "Would that
10 widespread belief include half the people believe
11 it and half don't," what would your answer be?
12
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
13 A. Again, I would point out what I know. What
14 is the historical evidence? The historical
15 evidence is that it's overwhelming, that it is
16 almost taken for granted that it's bad for you,
17 that it can kill you, that it can shorten your
18 life. That's the answer I would give them, and I
19 would point out Ms. Whitney's experiences.
20 Frankly, they seem to be pretty typical in my
21 experience. Parents don't want their kids to
22 smoke, whether it's 1950 or later, for a reason.
23 Q. One more time. Would you include in your
0146
1 definition of widespread belief, half the people
2 believe it and half not, regardless of polls,
3 generally speaking, whatever the subject?
4
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
5 A. Whatever the subject?
6 Q. Yes.
7 A. Again, you know, my area is public
8 awareness. What is the level of public
9 awareness? And again, for this earlier period,
10 you have to rely on a lot of different sources,
11 for the later period as well. And it's just
12 taken for granted that this is bad for you.
13 Q. So does why they believe include mere
14 50-50, in your opinion?
15
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
16 A. Again, I don't really feel qualified to
17 express an opinion. I'm not a pollster. It's
18 not my area of expertise.
19 Q. To what do you attribute that -- just
20 assume for me what I'm telling you is correct in
21 the polls, that -- let's leave smokers out.
22 Let's just take the whole. 40 percent in '54 and
23 somewhere around 60 percent believed smoking
0147
1 caused lung cancer, so there's only been a
2 20 percent increase in ten years. Why isn't it
3 90 percent in the mid '60s, from your
4 investigation?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5
MR. COTTON: I'm sorry. Can you read that
6 back, please?
7 Q. I'll restate it. Assume for me that the
8 polls show 40 percent of people from Gallup said
9 in 1954 that they think cigarette smoking caused
10 lung cancer, that was 40 percent, and moving ten
11 years later into the mid '60s that it was
12 60 percent, so it's gone up 20 percent. Are you
13 with me so far?
14 A. (Witness nodded yes.)
15 Q. Okay. From your investigation, why would
16 it not be 90 percent a decade after 1954?
17
MR. COTTON: I'll object to the form. Can
18 you read that, please?
19
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
20 portion of the testimony was read back by the
21 court reporter.)
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
23 foundation, calls for speculation.
0148
1 A. I'll say I don't know, and I also say that
2 the information about the dangers of smoking
3 during that entire period is rolling at a rapid,
4 rapid rate from multiple sources.
5 Q. Would you say that -- assume the data is
6 that in the mid 1960s that 60 percent of people
7 as a whole believed that smoking caused lung
8 cancer, and only 50 percent of smokers believed
9 it in the mid '60s, would you say the controversy
10 is over or still ongoing --
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
12 Q. -- at that point?
13 A. Again, it depends on how you define things
14 like "controversy." I'm more interested in what
15 was the information that was being made available
16 to the public, and that is just growing rapidly,
17 and the levels of awareness are growing rapidly.
18 Q. Okay. And is there still, from your
19 investigation, is it a done deal in the
20 majority -- strike that. Do you have an opinion
21 one way or the other as to whether the
22 controversy over whether or not smoking caused
23 lung cancer is ongoing or done with by the mid
0149
1 '60s?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, beyond the
3 scope.
4 A. There are still people that don't buy into
5 it, but they are becoming a smaller and smaller
6 group, and the media has taken it for granted.
7 The stories are expressing the dangers of
8 smoking. And certainly we have the percentage of
9 the population saying it's harmful is
10 skyrocketing as well.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 Q. And from your entire investigation and all
12 sources, you have no explanation for why in the
13 mid '60s approximately only 60 percent of the
14 people were convinced that smoking caused lung
15 cancer?
16
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
17 A. Again, it depends on how you view it. I
18 think there's a rapid increase in people moving
19 in that direction, but I'm not studying
20 motivations. I'm studying -- I'm not studying
21 psychology. I'm studying what I see, and what I
22 see is overwhelming information out there
23 becoming more and more overwhelming as time goes
0150
1 by.
2 Q. I'm going to try again, then I'm going to
3 ask the court reporter to mark it, unless I get
4 an answer. Then we'll move on. From your
5 investigation, using all sources, did you form
6 any opinion as to why only 60 percent,
7 approximately 60 percent of all people in the mid
8 '60s, were convinced that cigarette smoking
9 caused lung cancer? Have you reached a
10 conclusion as to why?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
12 A. No, I did not form an opinion on that.
13 Q. How about let's move to the mid '70s. If
14 the polling showed 30 percent of all people
15 polled and 40 percent of smokers now out in the
16 mid '70s are not convinced that smoking causes
17 lung cancer, did you reach any conclusion as to
18 why the numbers were higher at that time, based
19 on all of your information?
20
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
21 A. Again, that's not a question that I was
22 looking at. I was looking at what was the level
23 of awareness, and I just included among smokers
0151
1 it's becoming very, very high. Karen Whitney,
2 for example, read the warning label at an early
3 point, created conflicts in her own mind at an
4 early point, and the label came out in 1966.
5 Q. I move to strike. I didn't ask you a word
6 about Karen Whitney in that question. Did I ask
7 you a word about Karen Whitney in that question?
8 A. You were asking about -- I was pointing out
9 the high levels of awareness over time.
10 Q. My question was, did you form an opinion
11 one way or the other as to why the numbers
12 weren't higher?
13 A. No, I did not.
14 Q. Assume for me that in 1970 -- I'm sorry, in
15 1987, that's pretty late in the game, right?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 A. Late in the game? You know, it's a period
18 that is pretty late after a lot of the research.
19 Q. How many people would you say in 1987 still
20 were not convinced that smoking caused lung
21 cancer, in 1987?
22 A. Again, I would want to look at the poll
23 data to confirm this, but you're talking about
0152
1 that time -- you know, again, this is just based
2 on my memory -- I think less than 10 percent
3 you're talking about, that range.
4 Q. Would you be surprised if it was
5 approximately 20 percent?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 A. Again, I'd have to look at the poll data.
8 Q. Would you be surprised if it was
9 approximately 20 percent?
10 A. I don't know. I need to look at the poll
11 data. That's the answer I should have given you
12 initially, because it's been awhile since I've
13 reviewed some of those later polls.
14 Q. Have you reached any opinion, based on the
15 totality of your investigation, to explain why in
16 1987, 20 percent of the people polled still were
17 not convinced that smoking caused lung cancer?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
19 A. No, I have not, but I know the levels of
20 people saying it was harmful were certainly
21 higher by that period. But I have not, no. I
22 need to review the polls to see what precisely
23 they say. It's been awhile.
0153
1 Q. And you were not interested in your
2 investigation, having been hired by the defense
3 in this case, of looking into what you could find
4 as a historian to explain why these polls didn't
5 rise more dramatically more quickly?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 Q. Is that fair?
8
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
9 A. I think they are rising dramatically, but
10 I'm not an expert on polling, and I am trying to
11 look at what reached the public, in this case
12 what reached Karen Whitney in terms of
13 information about the dangers of smoking; and the
14 information that was conveyed was that it could
15 kill you, it could shorten your life, it was
16 habit-forming once started, and that you
17 should -- her parents. She was getting that from
18 a number of different sources, that this is
19 something they disapproved of.
20 Q. Move to strike. Let me go back to my
21 question. Did I ask you in that question about
22 Karen Whitney?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 A. I was telling you what my research was.
0154
1 You were asking me about my research, and I told
2 you what my research was.
3 Q. Just so we're clear, because I know you
4 haven't done this much, and I just want to make
5 sure you understand. Do you understand the
6 purpose of this is for me to ask questions and
7 you to answer them? It is not a quorum for you
8 to tell me the things you want to say. Do you
9 understand the distinction?
10 A. I do, yes.
11 Q. Okay. Would it be fair to say that you
12 were not interested, in your investigation, to
13 find out why it took from January of '54 to
14 January of '87, that it had gone from 40 percent
15 to 80 percent that believed cigarette smoking
16 caused lung cancer?
17
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
18 Q. That's over thirty years to reach even
19 80 percent. Were you interested in getting an
20 answer to that question or not?
21
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
22 A. Again, I don't know that I would agree with
23 the premise of the question. I think there's
0155
1 rapid movement. Having said that, that's not my
2 focus. That is not my focus as a researcher.
3 Q. And by "not my focus," would you agree you
4 weren't interested in getting an answer to that
5 question?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
7 A. As part of my research, I'm interested in
8 answering the research questions I've tackled, as
9 would be true in any case of historical research.
10 Q. But can you say, "I was not interested in
11 getting an answer to that question"?
12
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
13 A. I don't know that I'm not interested in it.
14 It's not something I've thought a lot about.
15 Something I'm focusing on is what actually is
16 happening on the ground, and what you see is an
17 overwhelming amount of information being
18 conveyed, including to Karen Whitney.
19 Q. Did you in your investigation reach any
20 opinions or conclusions as to why less smokers
21 believed at various times, according to the
22 polls, that smoking caused lung cancer than
23 nonsmokers?
0156
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. No, I did not. I --
3
MR. COTTON: You've answered the question.
4
THE WITNESS: Okay.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 Q. Did you see from your investigation that
6 cigarette companies publicly using phrases like
7 "enjoyment" and "choice" when talking about --
8 A. Enjoyment, and what was the second one?
9 Q. Choice, when talking about public health
10 claims that nicotine was addictive?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
12 foundation.
13 A. I don't -- I mean, certainly that is -- you
14 know --
15
MR. COTTON: He's asking if you recall
16 anything like that.
17 A. Oh. If I recall seeing them say things
18 like, "You will enjoy smoking this brand"?
19 Certainly, yes.
20 Q. No. In response to allegations from public
21 health that nicotine was addictive, did you see
22 cigarette companies respond by saying, "This is
23 an enjoyable or pleasant activity, and it is a
0157
1 matter of choice"?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
3 foundation.
4 A. I don't know to what extent they would
5 argue it was a matter of choice. Certainly, they
6 would say a lot of people smoke because they
7 enjoy it. I don't know if it was in response to
8 anything in particular, other than them saying,
9 "Hey, you know, a lot of Americans enjoy this,"
10 enjoy this. I don't see anybody denying that
11 it's a habit, that it could be a difficult habit
12 to break. I don't even see that coming -- maybe
13 I need to look harder, but I don't see it even
14 coming from cigarette companies. That's almost
15 taken for granted.
16 Q. All right. If you believe that there was
17 widespread belief that smoking was addictive, all
18 the way back at the turn of the century, how do
19 you square that with the surgeon general in the
20 '60s saying smoking or nicotine was not
21 addictive?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
23 A. Well, also the World Health Organization, I
0158
1 believe, says the same thing, but they say it's a
2 habit, and they emphasize that it's a habit
3 that's very difficult to break. "Addiction" is
4 one of those terms where there's a popular use of
5 it, there's a pharmacological use of it. They're
6 not denying it's a habit, and they're not denying
7 that it's a very difficult habit to break. In
8 fact, the surgeon general is often emphasizing
9 that, Mr. Luther Terry, Dr. Terry.
10 Q. From your investigation, do you think
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 there's any difference in the deterrent effect
12 between calling something a mere habit and
13 calling it a drug addiction?
14
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, calls for
15 speculation, beyond the scope of expertise.
16 A. Again, I'm not a pharmacologist. I don't
17 recall them saying "mere habit." You know, the
18 emphasis was this is a habit that's very
19 difficult to break. But I don't know what went
20 into their minds as to why they used one term or
21 another, because I'm not a specialist on the
22 definition of addiction from a medical
23 pharmacological standpoint and how that has
0159
1 changed over time.
2 Q. My question is, from your investigation,
3 were you able to reach any conclusions or
4 opinions as to the difference between calling
5 something a habit or a drug addiction from the
6 perspective of deterrence for teenagers?
7
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, beyond the
8 scope of expertise.
9 A. No, that's not an area that I've looked at.
10 Q. Tell me what evidence you're planning to
11 talk about at trial specific to Karen Whitney.
12
MR. COTTON: Objection, form, overly broad.
13 A. Okay. Well, some examples would be
14 textbooks that were assigned in science, biology,
15 health classes; newspapers in areas where she
16 lived, both in Florida and Illinois; news
17 reports. She was somebody that, you know,
18 followed the news, the main networks and popular
19 culture, TV shows that were on, movies. You
20 know, those are some of the sources. The smoking
21 cessation program that she attended, the one at
22 Hialeah Hospital, 1970, '71, that's certainly an
23 area, you know, that I've looked at and that I
0160
1 plan to present information about. And I don't
2 know if I should bring this up now, this stuff.
3
MR. COTTON: Whatever is responsive to the
4 question.
5 A. This is additional material that we found,
6 but her high school was a model school, along
7 with two other schools in Dade County, was
8 considered a model school for the President's
9 Council on Physical Fitness. So there's some
10 interesting literature on that during the period
11 which indicates that that program put a lot of
12 emphasis on smoking. So those are some, as I sit
13 here today thinking about it, those are some of
14 the main sources. I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot,
15 but those are some of the main ones.
16 Q. Well, I don't want to forget a lot. And
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 I'm not talking about the history showed turn of
18 the century coming all the way forward in that.
19 I'm talking about specific to Karen Whitney.
20 A. Right.
21 Q. You've told me textbooks, newspapers where
22 she lived, news reports, TV shows, movies,
23 smoking cessation at Hialeah in '70 and '71, and
0161
1 this model school, high school. What else
2 specific to her do you plan to present evidence
3 on?
4
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
5 A. Well, again, I need to look at my list
6 again. I don't recall everything. Those would
7 be, I guess, the main things, but there's more
8 stuff I've got on the list that would relate to
9 her.
10 Q. Well, then look at whatever --
11 A. Well, school board minutes for Dade County,
12 Florida, in which the school board emphasizes
13 shortly before she started attending school
14 there, that they've taught the dangers of tobacco
15 for decades and continue to teach it in each
16 grade. So that would be an example, again, about
17 how this was very much stressed in her schooling
18 as an issue, both in textbooks and other aspects
19 of her schooling.
20 Q. Okay. What else?
21 A. Let's see. I said newspapers, such as the
22 Miami papers, the Herald, and the Reader's Digest
23 would be an example of a periodical that was in
0162
1 the home. Life magazine was also mentioned as a
2 periodical that was read. But as I'm sitting
3 here right now, those are the only ones that
4 really come to mind. But I'm sure there's more
5 as I review my list and the list that already has
6 been presented, that would directly relate to
7 her.
8 Q. I don't care what you reviewed. I need to
9 know what you consider the evidence you're going
10 to present specific to my client.
11 A. Well, that's all I recall at the moment.
12 Q. Well, this is my chance --
13
(Off-the-record discussion.)
14 Q. This is my chance to know. I don't want to
15 hear, "That's some of it; but, you know, there's
16 some more, but I don't remember." Now is my
17 chance, and I don't care what you look at or what
18 you do. If you plan to talk about it at trial
19 and it's specific to my client, I need you to
20 list it for me.
21 A. Again, you know, there is a reliance list.
22 I don't -- at this particular moment, I can't
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 recall everything. I don't have a photographic
0163
1 memory. I wish I did, but I don't.
2 Q. Well, look at whatever you need to. I'm
3 going to move on in a minute. If you're telling
4 me, "That's all I can tell you," then I'm going
5 to accept that's all, and on the record I'm going
6 to object to anything else.
7
MR. COTTON: Objection.
8 Q. It's not my job to go through your reliance
9 list that it's --
10 A. Well, there would be -- I think there would
11 be a lot of material that might have been things
12 that her -- you know, if you're talking about the
13 earlier period, that her parents read, that her
14 grandparents read; what were some possible
15 reasons why they didn't want her to smoke, for
16 example. So I think that material is relevant.
17 It would be relevant to people she knew, to
18 siblings. For example, one of the sources that
19 we often use is the stars and stripes. Well, she
20 wasn't in the military, but she had family
21 members who were. She's getting this from a lot
22 of different sources, from people in a lot of
23 different areas; doctors, you know, siblings,
0164
1 older people in the family. I think it's
2 important -- for me at least, context matters --
3 to get a sense of how that context that she grew
4 up in was shaped.

MR. COTTON: Did I hear you say "warnings"?
6
THE WITNESS: Excuse me?
7
MR. COTTON: Did I hear you say "warnings"?
8 A. Warning labels would certainly be an
9 example of that, what was going on in terms of
10 public policy; the surgeon general's reports,
11 statements in surgeon general's reports, that
12 kind of thing. So there's a lot of different
13 sources. You know, I can't remember all of them
14 right now.
15 Q. So we're clear, I'm not asking about some
16 surgeon general report that everybody -- unless
17 you're planning to say she specifically saw it.
18 Are you?
19 A. No, I'm not.
20 Q. Okay. I'm asking --
21 A. She certainly was aware of the warning
22 labels, though; but there's no evidence she was
23 aware of the report.
0165
1 Q. I'm asking you specific to my client that
2 you believe she either -- you have direct
3 evidence she saw or you believe circumstantially
4 she would have seen it.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
6 Q. Specific to my client, not the general
7 things that everybody in the population would
8 have been exposed to.
9
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
10 A. I've given you what I specifically remember
11 that would be specifically things that would have
12 either been in the home and introduced to her in
13 some way; not necessarily that she read
14 everything or that she read a particular article
15 or whatever, but newspapers that were in the
16 home, for example.
17 Q. I'm going to move on unless you have
18 something else to add to the list.
19 A. As I'm thinking here today, I can't think
20 of anything offhand.
21 Q. Okay. Did you review polls that talked
22 about the vast number of smokers who wished they
23 had never started smoking?
0166
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. Not specifically. I have certainly seen
3 those polls, that there are a lot of smokers that
4 say that, yes. I know that in a general sense.
5 But I haven't reviewed those myself.
6 Q. Did you see in the polls the large
7 percentage of smokers who would like to give up
8 smoking?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
10 A. In a very general sense, I've seen that,
11 that a lot of smokers will say that in poll
12 responses.
13 Q. In some of the polls that were in your
14 reliance materials, there were big chunks
15 missing, like it skipped a hundred or two hundred
16 pages. Was that taken out by you or given to you
17 in a form it wasn't already in it?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
19 foundation.
20 A. It would depend on the poll, but what I was
21 looking for in polls were questions about health,
22 health and habit-forming nature of smoking, that
23 would touch on the awareness issues. That's what
0167
1 I focused on. So I would look at the polls and I
2 would look at questions on those issues.
3 Q. So you may very well have left out of the
4 materials that you put on your reliance list
5 pages of the poll?
6
MR. COTTON: Objection to the form,
7 mischaracterizes testimony.
8 A. I would -- you know, you would have even a
9 taller mountain of material. As a historian,
10 when I copy something, a source, I don't copy
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 that source.
12 Q. I'm not asking why. I'm just asking, did
13 you?
14 A. Sure. It's a standard practice as a
15 historian, you focus in on the topic at hand,
16 yes.
17 Q. Polls that you would have included in your
18 reliance list, I assume by the word "reliance,"
19 are matters that you relied on in your
20 investigation. Is that fair?
21
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
22 A. I would see it as more -- yes, in some
23 sense. Products of my investigation, I guess, I
0168
1 kind of would see it.
2 Q. What do you mean when you call it the
3 "reliance list"?
4 A. Again, I'm not a lawyer, so --
5 Q. Well, you just used the phrase, sir. A
6 little while ago you said, "I'd have to look at
7 my reliance list." What do you mean by "reliance
8 list"?
9 A. What do I mean? I mean material that are
10 indicators, evidence of public awareness, both in
11 general and in reference to Karen Whitney.
12 Q. Did you reach any conclusions or opinions
13 as to whether people believe filters make smoking
14 safer?
15 A. I think that Karen Whitney had the right
16 word when she described a belief that some people
17 had, including much of the public health
18 community, that they were a lesser evil. I think
19 that is a word that better describes it because
20 the emphasis is, this is bad for you; this causes
21 cancer. It's got the same warning label as other
22 things. So I think "lesser evil" is a more apt
23 way to put it as to how it is viewed, how filters
0169
1 are viewed.
2 Q. Did you see polls that talked about whether
3 or not people thought filters made smoking safer?
4 Didn't use the word evil, safer. Did you see
5 that in your investigation?
6 A. I don't remember specific poll questions
7 that used the word "safer," no.
8 Q. So your answer would be "No, I don't recall
9 that being used in any of the polls"?
10 A. The word "safer"?
11 Q. Yes.
12 A. I don't recall that offhand, no.
13 Q. Did you see polls in your reliance material
14 talking about what people considered to be more
15 dangerous, comparing smoking to other activities?
16 A. I've seen those kinds of polls, yes.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 Q. Did you see a poll where people talked
18 about what was more dangerous; swimming in a
19 lake, driving a car, riding in an airplane,
20 climbing out of a bathtub, smoking a cigarette?
21 Did you see that?
22 A. I may have, but I don't recall it
23 specifically.
0170
1 Q. Does it square with your opinions you plan
2 to give to the jury, if people had danger to life
3 for smoking way down to climbing out of a
4 bathtub --
5
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
6 Q. -- does that square with the opinions
7 you're giving about how much people appreciated
8 that it would kill you?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
10 A. I'm not an expert in, I guess it's called
11 risk perception, I'm not an expert in that
12 particular field and how you would weigh these
13 things.
14 Q. How does that square with what you're
15 telling the jury?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
17 A. I don't recall seeing that specific
18 question. I'll have to look it over.
19 Q. Well, if you assume that's what it says,
20 would you agree that generally speaking, that
21 doesn't seem to square with what you're telling
22 the jury about how much people appreciate smoking
23 would kill them?
0171
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. I would have to see the question, and I
3 would have to see the context of the question to
4 give an informed answer about that.
5 Q. Did you see where people thought that in
6 the poll that you had attached to your reliance
7 list, that breathing air in the city was more
8 dangerous to one's life than smoking a cigarette?
9 Did you see that poll?
10 A. I don't recall seeing that poll. It could
11 have been there, but I don't recall seeing that.
12 Q. Would that seem to square -- let me just
13 ask you this question. From your research, would
14 people have considered breathing air in a city
15 more of a risk to their life than smoking
16 cigarettes?
17
MR. COTTON: Objection, form.
18 A. I would have to look at it, I'd have to
19 know when it was, I'd have to know a lot of
20 things about it; and I'm not an expert in risk
21 perception.
22 Q. I'm actually leaving out of this question
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 the poll. I'm asking you, in 1959, if I just
0172
1 asked you the question, would people consider,
2 based on your investigation, that they're more
3 likely to die from just breathing the air in a
4 city than smoking a cigarette, what would your
5 answer be?
6
MR. COTTON: Could you read that back?
7
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
8 portion of the testimony was read back by the
9 court reporter.)
10
MR. COTTON: Do you understand that
11 question?
12
THE WITNESS: I think so.
13
MR. COTTON: I'll object to the form.
14 A. You know, again, I'm not an expert in this
15 area. Certainly, there's a lot of emphasis on,
16 during that period, a lot of emphasis on smog;
17 but, again, I need to look at it and get a look
18 at the full context, all the questions that were
19 asked and that kind of thing, to get a good sense
20 of what's going on.
21 Q. Okay. Move to strike. I'm going to ask
22 the question again. Without regard for the
23 poll -- I'm just asking you a general question --
0173
1 in 1959 based on your conclusion, do you believe
2 people think that they had a greater chance of
3 dying from smoking a cigarette than simply living
4 in the city with the smog in the air?
5
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
6 A. It would just be speculation on my part. I
7 need to have the poll in front of me to look at
8 it, to think about it. And I'm not an expert in
9 risk perception. There's a whole field there of
10 people, and that's not what I'm looking at.
11 Q. You referred to polls that indicated,
12 talking about the Tobacco Institute or the
13 Tobacco Industry Research Council, often called
14 TIRC, and that a very small percentage of people
15 would list them as most believe, if they said
16 there was no connection between lung cancer and
17 smoking. Do you remember that?
18
MR. COTTON: I'm sorry. Can you repeat
19 that?
20 Q. Do you remember a little while ago talking
21 to me about people weren't believing what
22 cigarette companies were saying or the Tobacco
23 Industry Research Council?
0174
1 A. Yes, I remember there was a poll in the
2 late '50s that asked about that.
3 Q. Did you see on the external information
4 that tobacco companies changed the name of TIRC?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 Did you see they actually changed the name of the
6 Tobacco Industry Research Council?
7 A. I think it had several different names over
8 the years.
9 Q. Do you know whether or not the cigarette
10 companies, from your investigation, used that
11 very polling to tell them they better change
12 their name so we don't have "tobacco industry" in
13 the name?
14 A. I don't recall.
15 Q. Do you know?
16 A. I don't recall reading that, no.
17 Q. Did you see that the cigarette industry was
18 polling a lot, through professional pollers,
19 about people's attitudes or beliefs regarding
20 dangers of smoking?
21
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
22 A. I don't know what "a lot" would be.
23 Certainly, there were -- there were quite a few
0175
1 polls, and usually I think that they dealt with a
2 lot of things, not just health issues.
3 Q. Did you investigate why the cigarette
4 industry was polling that subject?
5 A. No. They were polling a very wide range of
6 subjects. No, I didn't look at why they looked
7 at that one as opposed to asking about all sorts
8 of other things they asked about typically, or at
9 least in some of these polls it was just a wide
10 range, a profile of the smokers.
11 Q. You considered the results of their polls
12 to be reliable sources of information?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, overly
14 broad.
15 A. It would depend, but these were polls that
16 were generally -- the ones I paid most attention
17 to were the ones that were done by mainstream
18 polling firms, sometimes for the industry, like
19 Gallup and Roper.
20 Q. Did you see polls that talked about
21 people's belief in smoking causing lung cancer or
22 serious disease being tied to whether or not
23 someone was a heavy smoker, moderate smoker, or
0176
1 light smoker?
2 A. I don't know to what extent that -- there
3 probably were questions like that, but there were
4 certainly questions about whether someone was a
5 heavy smoker or light smoker. As to whether they
6 were tied to their beliefs about lung cancer
7 specifically in the poll, I don't recall seeing
8 that. It could well have happened.
9
(Whereupon, at this time a short break was
10 taken.)
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 Q. Are the materials involved in the model
12 school that you referred to not on your reliance
13 list?
14 A. Some of them are, some of them aren't. The
15 information about Hialeah High School being a
16 model school is reported in the home news, which
17 is on the reliance list. The specific material
18 about smoking and the President's Council on
19 Physical Fitness is something new, and that's
20 right here. That is not on the list.
21 Q. I want to attach that as the next exhibit
22 to the deposition. Summarize for me what that
23 says.
0177
1
(Whereupon, Plaintiffs' Exhibit Number
2 2 was marked for identification, a copy of which
3 is attached to the original of the transcript.)
4 A. Well, it's called A Complete Exercise Plan
5 for Girls 12 to 18. It's titled VIM, the one for
6 boys is titled VIGOR. It was 19 -- I'm not sure
7 when this was published, but it was published
8 sometime before May 19, 1964, sometime after
9 Kennedy's assassination. Then they lay out all
10 the tests, and then they have some commentary
11 here about smoking on page 22.
12 Q. And what's that commentary?
13 A. Okay. Let's see. It talks about personal
14 habits. "The things you don't do can be just as
15 important as the things you do do. Smoking is
16 one of the things no young person should do. It
17 reduces endurance and breathing capacity, and
18 research indicates that it is a factor in some
19 forms of cancer and heart disease. You may hear
20 someone say that not smoking is one of the
21 sacrifices you have to make for physical fitness
22 and good health. This is nonsense. The people
23 who make sacrifices are those who start smoking."
0178
1 Again, I would like to do a little bit more
2 research in that area of the President's Council,
3 but this is what I've found so far.
4 Q. Well, if you come up with anything else, we
5 need to be told, and we'll decide how to react --
6 A. Sure.
7 Q. -- and what's the appropriate way to
8 proceed. But I would hope to be told immediately
9 if you come up with anything else.
10 A. Sure.
11 Q. Understood?
12 A. Understood.
13 Q. From your research, what were cigarette
14 companies saying about addiction in the '50s and
15 '60s?
16
MR. COTTON: Objection, form, lack of
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 foundation.
18 A. Well, the source I've got, you know, would
19 reach the public, but I see them say very little
20 about it one way or the other. It's not
21 emphasized.
22 Q. How about -- I said '50s and '60s. How
23 about in the '70s, what were they saying?
0179
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. Again, if what appears in the popular media
3 that reaches the public is any indication, very,
4 very little.
5 Q. How about in the '80s?
6 A. I would say the same thing.
7 Q. How about in the '90s?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection, form.
9 A. To the extent I've looked at the '90s and
10 that really hasn't been the focus, you know, I
11 don't see any difference in the, you know, level
12 of emphasis.
13 Q. Have you looked in the '90s?
14 A. Yes, I have. But that has not been the
15 major focus, but I certainly have looked at
16 newspapers and some other sources for that
17 period.
18 Q. How about 2000?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection, form.
20 A. Not very much. A little bit, but not very
21 much. The focus has been pre-1980.
22 Q. How about currently?
23 A. Very little. Very little.
0180
1 Q. What have you looked at?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection, form.
3 A. Oh, it's hard to say. I guess -- probably,
4 you know, see an occasional news story or
5 something like that. But that's -- there really
6 isn't anything systematic that I've done. I did
7 go through the New York Times. I think that took
8 me towards the end of the '90s. That was a few
9 years ago.
10 Q. Did you use any particular newspapers and
11 try to go through and run a percentage of
12 articles that had comments from public health
13 versus comments from the cigarette industry?
14 A. No. Just gained a kind of rough impression
15 based on what I saw over the years, but I didn't
16 do a precise kind of -- I guess you'd call that
17 content analysis.
18 Q. Did you look at any polls in 2000 or up to
19 the current?
20 A. If I did, I just saw one in a newspaper, or
21 something, glanced at it, but no. The focus was
22 on polls for the earlier period; really, as much
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 as possible the pre-1980s period up to the early
0181
1 '80s.
2 Q. How come?
3 A. Because, you know, I believe, again, that
4 the information had become so overwhelming at
5 that point, that it was very difficult to --
6 becoming even more difficult to avoid it. I
7 think there just had been a level of information
8 that had reached a certain saturation point.
9 Q. Did you do any investigation into the
10 effects of advertising?
11 A. No. No, not per se.
12 Q. Any investigation as to -- let me back up.
13 From the turn of the century on, everybody --
14 knowing that nicotine was a highly addictive
15 drug, did you look into whether people realized
16 there was actually an addictive drug in
17 cigarettes?
18
MR. COTTON: Objection. Objection to form.
19 A. Excuse me. Could you repeat that?
20 Q. Yes. Did you look to see about public
21 awareness that nicotine was an addictive drug in
22 cigarettes? As opposed to smoking being
23 addictive, there's something about it,
0182
1 specifically that there was a drug in tobacco
2 called nicotine that was an addictive drug, did
3 you do any investigation as to the cause of that?
4 A. I've seen that it shows up in the popular
5 culture, that in the newspapers nicotine is
6 emphasized. You see movies like Hitchcock movies
7 from the 1940s, Salvador, where the guy talks
8 about he's a nicotine addict. Nicotine is
9 emphasized as the aspect of smoking that has --
10 creates -- enhances the habit, creates the habit,
11 creates the addiction.
12 Q. But that would be true throughout the 1900s
13 up to 1960?
14 A. Yes, yes. Even going back further that
15 nicotine is emphasized.
16 Q. Any opinions on warning labels?
17 A. I'm sorry. Any opinions on warning labels?
18
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19 Q. Yes. Other than saying, "Here they are,"
20 something you can see, any other opinions about
21 them?
22 A. You mean poll data on warning labels?
23 Q. Anything.
0183
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. Certainly, there was poll data by, you
3 know, groups like the National Clearing House on
4 Smoking and Health would ask about who had seen
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 warning labels and that kind of thing, sure.
6 Q. Did you look at polls that -- did you look
7 at FTC reports or government reports that talked
8 about whether or not warning labels were
9 effective?
10 A. Yes. I looked at some of those FTC reports
11 that had discussion on that.
12 Q. And what was the conclusion as to whether
13 or not the warning labels were effective?
14 A. I think it kind of depended on which
15 report. I think some of them -- some of the
16 reports -- again, I need to review those, because
17 I have looked at those -- argue they weren't very
18 effective, but then you have others that, you
19 know, sort of emphasize it's getting out there.
20 In fact, smokers are more likely to be aware of
21 warning labels than nonsmokers, that there are
22 warning labels on cigarettes.
23 Q. Did you look at the question throughout the
0184
1 turn of the century up through 2000, why if
2 everybody knew nicotine was a highly addictive
3 drug, that there was no FDA regulations? Did you
4 look into that subject?
5
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
6 A. No, I didn't look into that subject.
7 Q. Did you look into the subject of risk
8 reduction, what's out there on risk reduction
9 from a perspective of what information was
10 available?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
12 A. Could you be more specific?
13 Q. Sure. Do you know when we talk about risk
14 reduction, what I'm talking about?
15 A. Could you tell me?
16 Q. No. I'm not being a smart aleck. If it's
17 something you have opinions on, you'd know what
18 I'm talking about.
19 A. No, I don't have an opinion on that as
20 such. My focus is awareness.
21 Q. Did you do any investigation into the
22 effects of advertising, on why people take up
23 smoking or keep smoking?
0185
1 A. No, other than I would consider the ads
2 when I saw them, and I include those.
3 Q. Did you look at any government records or
4 documents that talked about the amount of money
5 being spent by cigarette companies, and how that
6 compared to what public health was able to spend?
7 A. I've certainly seen -- I've seen those
8 documents mentioned; but, you know, that hasn't
9 been a focus of my research.
10 Q. Did you reach any conclusions in that
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 regard?
12
MR. COTTON: Objection, form.
13 A. Again, I'm looking -- you know, my focus is
14 on awareness issues. I'm not an expert in
15 advertising methods or internal industry
16 discussions or psychology.
17 Q. Have you seen the letter that was written
18 to Lacy Ford by Frank Newport, editor and chief
19 of Gallup, in 1998 --
20 A. That doesn't ring a bell. That doesn't
21 ring a bell.
22 Q. -- voicing dissatisfaction with what
23 Mr. Newport was saying, saying that Ford was
0186
1 misusing Gallup polls in cigarette litigation?
2 You're not aware of that?
3 A. No.
4 Q. The level of addiction that you say was in
5 the public awareness since the turn of the
6 century regarding nicotine, your investigation
7 would be that that level of nicotine addiction
8 where it enslaves somebody, that they can get off
9 of it, but that's a perception or a description,
10 would be much more significant of an addiction
11 from the perspective of public awareness than,
12 say, drinking coffee; is that correct?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection to the form.
14 A. Yes, I think it is emphasized, certainly in
15 the textbooks that is communicated; and in the
16 newspaper articles, it is emphasized that this is
17 a much stronger -- this is a much stronger habit
18 or addiction.
19 Q. And would that be also true of what you're
20 able to read that is an expression of people's
21 experience that made it into the public domain?
22 A. Yes. Yes.
23 Q. And you would say that that public
0187
1 perception of nicotine being a highly addictive
2 drug, much more so than, say, drinking coffee,
3 would be in the public awareness and perception
4 today; would you not?
5
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
6 A. Again, I haven't looked at recent poll
7 data, but I think people are often using
8 expressions like "nicotine fit" and that kind of
9 thing, so that would indicate that it's pretty
10 pervasive, even though nicotine is --
11 Q. You have no reason to think suddenly people
12 started thinking nicotine addiction -- after the
13 turn of the century up through 1990, suddenly
14 started thinking less of it as an addiction, do
15 you?
16 A. That doesn't square with my impression.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 But, again, I haven't done a lot of research on
18 recent views on that.
19 Q. There is a document that is labeled Claims
20 that Cigarettes are Addictive Irresponsible and
21 Scare Tactics, 1988, that was released by the
22 cigarette industry, and it's responding to the
23 surgeon general's report that said nicotine was
0188
1 as addictive as heroin. Are you familiar with
2 that surgeon general report?
3 A. Yes, in a general sense, Everett Koop --
4
MR. COTTON: Object to the form of the
5 preceding question.
6 A. -- came up and switched that. I think it
7 was Everett Koop, was the one that switched that
8 definition.
9 Q. In your investigation, did you come across
10 the cigarette industry having any response to
11 that surgeon general's assertion that nicotine
12 was addictive as heroin?
13 A. Like I said, I don't recall -- you know,
14 again, my focus has been -- before the 1980s that
15 they said much of anything about it. Of course,
16 that was determined, as you said, later. So I
17 didn't really do a lot of research on that, what
18 their response was; but I certainly don't see
19 much of a response to that issue of addiction,
20 habit, et cetera. They're concerned with other
21 issues. The cigarette industry is making
22 arguments about association, arguments about we
23 need more research with reference to lung cancer,
0189
1 mainly. Those are the two things, it's like you
2 hear them over and over again, those two
3 arguments. I don't really see much --
4 Q. What two arguments did you hear over and
5 over again?
6 A. Again, I'm looking at the pre-1980s period,
7 it had not been proven that cigarette smoking
8 causes lung cancer, that association does not
9 equal causation, that we need more research.
10 That kind of arguments, they're stressing. And
11 those --
12 Q. And when you say "over and over again,"
13 what do you mean? Where at?
14
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
15 A. When there is, you know, an industry
16 comment in newspapers; but as I said, that's
17 becoming less and less significant over time,
18 you'll see that argument made.
19 Q. How about on TV?
20 A. On TV, yes, certainly.
21
MR. COTTON: I object to the form,
22 belatedly, of that question.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 Q. Did you ever see when the heads of the
0190
1 cigarette companies testified before Congress, in
2 that famous clip where they all raised their hand
3 and said, "I, too, do not believe that nicotine
4 is addictive"? Have you seen that?
5
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
6 A. Yes, I've seen that.
7 Q. What did you make of that?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
9 A. In what -- in what respect? Could you be
10 more specific, please?
11 Q. Does that seem to be consistent with what
12 you say everybody had figured out by then, that
13 it was a highly addictive drug?
14 A. Again, my recollection of that is, I don't
15 think there was a denial that it could be a
16 habit, it could be difficult to break. I think
17 they were -- I don't know what was in their minds
18 as to why. You know, maybe they had a quibbling
19 with the use of terminology such as addiction
20 versus habit.
21 Q. Did you look at all to see what kind of
22 impact that denial by the cigarette company had
23 on public opinion in regard to the addictiveness
0191
1 and how addictive nicotine was?
2 A. Generally, the press coverage I've seen was
3 very hostile to the industry, very much
4 belittling the industry. In fact, I think the
5 congressmen were very much trying to get them to
6 go on record, and it was made light of. It was
7 satirized. It was a general response.
8 Q. Did you see anything in your investigation
9 to indicate that the cigarette companies would
10 intentionally employ satire to make light of the
11 dangers of smoking?
12 A. No, I don't think they were being
13 satirical. I think that media commentators were
14 saying, you know -- were portraying them in a
15 very negative light and were using serious
16 criticism and also sort of sarcastic, you know,
17 satire to belittle them.
18 Q. Would it be your conclusion that those
19 denials in front of Congress had no impact on the
20 public opinion regarding the serious addictive
21 nature of nicotine in cigarettes?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
23 A. I've never looked at that, but certainly
0192
1 the tone of media coverage is not positive.
2 Q. Have you ever seen any indication the
3 cigarette companies throughout the time period of
4 the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, would employ
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 contacting the media to get the satirical, light
6 coverage of dangers of smoking to make light of
7 it?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
9 A. No, I haven't seen that specifically. I've
10 been focusing on what actually reached the
11 public.
12 Q. Did you see any public comments back in
13 1988 following when Koop said nicotine was as
14 addictive as heroin, from the cigarette industry?
15
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
16 A. I don't recall any specific comments on
17 that issue.
18 Q. Are you saying there were none, or you just
19 don't recall as you sit here today?
20 A. I don't recall, and I think there was a lot
21 of -- there was some discussion out there, I
22 don't know from the industry, about what's an
23 addiction, what's a habit. You know, a lot of
0193
1 people might use the term "habit" and they might
2 be talking about what others would interpret as
3 an addiction.
4 Q. From your investigation, did you conclude
5 that the people's experiences as reported in
6 public documents indicated that the level of
7 nicotine addiction was in the same grip level as
8 heroin?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection, form.
10 A. Not specifically, but certainly I've seen
11 people compare cigarettes, early stage in
12 textbooks, and so forth, to other drugs, and it
13 was often grouped under narcotics in the school
14 books when they were discussing the issue.
15 People used the term "addicts" like they would
16 use the term "drug addicts" occasionally, so I
17 think they really vary. I see that out there
18 early on.
19 Q. Early on seeing it being associated with
20 the same type of group of addiction as hard
21 drugs?
22 A. Yes. And I haven't done a systematic thing
23 to say what percentage of the population believed
0194
1 that, or anything. But you see that a lot in
2 commentary, newspapers, textbooks.
3 Q. Did you look at scholastic polls, Senior
4 Scholastic polls?
5 A. Yes, I did. There was a poll done by
6 Senior Scholastic, I think, in the early '60s of
7 teenagers, I believe.
8 Q. And did you see in 1960 that when these
9 teenagers were asked, "What do you think about
10 cancer and cigarette-smoking," that 19 percent --
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 I'm sorry, almost 20 percent said they think you
12 only -- "I think only heavy smoking puts you at
13 greater risk for lung cancer than a nonsmoker,"
14 and that another 32 percent said they think it
15 may have a connection, but there's no conclusive
16 proof?
17
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
18 Q. And another 2 percent thought there was no
19 connection?
20
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
21 Q. Did you see that?
22 A. Yes. But again, I don't have it in front
23 of me. I remember being impressed by that poll
0195
1 by the high levels of belief that there was an
2 association, and younger people -- you know,
3 there's evidence that the younger people took
4 this to heart a lot faster, probably because they
5 were getting more and more emphasis in their
6 schooling. So I was impressed by how they were
7 kind of ahead of the public in some sense.
8 Q. Well, did you make a distinction when you
9 were saying that there was this widespread
10 understanding that smoking caused lung cancer,
11 was that only for people that smoked heavy, or
12 just in general?
13 A. I think I said, you know, as you were
14 pointing out, that the early polls indicate
15 40 percent, gets up to 50 percent, and the
16 scholastic poll impressed me because the
17 percentages were much higher of belief in that
18 poll than in the polls for adults during the
19 period, or just adults in general.
20 Q. That didn't have anything to do with my
21 question. My question is, when you said that
22 there was widespread belief that smoking caused
23 lung cancer, were you making a distinction
0196
1 between heavy smokers getting lung cancer versus
2 any smoker?
3 A. No. I was just talking about was there an
4 association, was there a causal factor, not
5 breaking it down into heavy versus light smokers.
6 Q. So if only 45 percent, less than half of
7 the high school seniors, believed that smoking in
8 general, including light smokers as well as heavy
9 smokers, caused lung cancer, does that square
10 with your conclusions that there was this
11 widespread belief that smoking caused lung
12 cancer?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
14 A. That smoking was the cause of lung cancer,
15 I think that poll also showed that a very high
16 percentage thought there was a link, which is
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 much higher than the general public at the time.
18 So the younger people seemed to be moving in that
19 direction a lot faster in making this
20 association.
21 Q. Well, 32 percent thought there might be a
22 correlation but didn't know. That's a pretty
23 high percentage, isn't it?
0197
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2 A. Might be? I mean, I think if you add
3 might, is, and so forth, again, it impressed me
4 as a much higher percentage than the general
5 population.
6 Q. You didn't see polls that the general
7 population said 90 percent thought it might,
8 might cause?
9
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
10 A. I don't know if I recall seeing a poll that
11 said in that period where 90 percent say it --
12 you know, I don't recall that terminology being
13 used. Poll questions are probably asked -- at
14 least the ones I've looked at, the Gallup polls,
15 the emphasis is on "is it" or "doesn't it."
16 Q. So if 32 percent of the kids said, "There
17 may be a connection, I just don't know," would
18 you consider that widespread?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection, form.
20 Q. Widespread belief that lung cancer is a
21 result of smoking?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection, form.
23 A. Well, again, as I pointed out, in that
0198
1 earlier period we both talked about that, you
2 know, the polls in 1960 say 50 percent total of
3 adults say there is a link, and this poll is
4 breaking it down into various sub categories.
5 But if you add them up, it is a higher percentage
6 than the public as a whole. I remember being
7 impressed by that. Now, the methodology of the
8 polls are obviously quite different.
9 Q. Sir, that isn't remotely close to what I
10 asked you. Could you read the question back,
11 please?
12
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
13 portion of the testimony was read back by the
14 court reporter.)
15 A. Yes. And if you add that to the percentage
16 that says it is a cause, which I think you'd want
17 to do, that would create an impressive percentage
18 compared to the percentage in the general
19 population.
20 Q. So is your answer the fact that 32 percent
21 didn't believe there was conclusive proof, add to
22 that another 2 percent didn't believe there was a
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 connection at all, didn't even consider it a
0199
1 possibility, so you're up to almost 35 percent of
2 these high school kids weren't convinced, would
3 you say --
4 A. Well, there's a difference between "might"
5 and "isn't," I think. "Might" is, you know, it
6 could be a cause.
7 Q. My question is, assume for me that
8 32 percent of those kids thought it may have some
9 connection, but there's no conclusive evidence
10 which links the two together. Is that number
11 consistent with what you would describe as
12 widespread belief that it in fact is to blame?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
14 Q. Not could be, is.
15 A. Taken alone, I would say compared to other
16 polls, no. But taken with the percentage who
17 says it is a cause, I would say yes.
18 Q. And if we add to that another 19 percent,
19 almost 20, 19.6, rounded to 20, who think it's
20 only causally related if someone smokes two or
21 more packs a day?
22
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
23 Q. So that means that if it's less than two
0200
1 packs a day, it's not related, right?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection to form. The
3 document speaks for itself, calls for
4 speculation.
5 A. I don't know. I mean, I'd have to see the
6 poll, but it certainly indicates a belief that
7 there's an association, which I again think the
8 young people are ahead of the adults on this, in
9 linking these issues, which I think is
10 significant.
11 Q. I'm going to quote it for you. "I think
12 only a heavy smoker (one who smokes two or more
13 packs a day) runs a greater risk of lung cancer
14 than a nonsmoker." That means if you're smoking
15 less than two packs a day, you're at no greater
16 risk for lung cancer than a nonsmoker. Nearly
17 20 percent of these kids believe that. Is that
18 consistent with widespread belief that smoking
19 causes lung cancer without regard for having to
20 smoke two packs a day to be a risk?
21
MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
22 foundation.
23 A. Well, again, we're on a semantics issue.
0201
1 If I said that the belief was widespread in 1960,
2 I guess that is open to interpretation of what
3 widespread is. But as I said, 50 percent of the
4 population says -- sees any association or
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 specifically goes on record for an association.
6 If you add those up together, this is a higher
7 percentage than that. So we're moving in that
8 direction, given what, ten years of research on
9 the issue, basically, that has been publicized
10 heavily anyway.
11 Q. So do you include 50-50 believe and aren't
12 convinced to be widespread belief? Would that be
13 included in your definition of "widespread"?
14
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
15 A. As I've said before, I'm not a pollster. I
16 don't know how a pollster defines "widespread,"
17 even if they have a definition of that. It's
18 rapidly growing over time. I consider that, the
19 polls point in that direction.
20 Q. But I'm not asking you for pollster
21 expertise. I'm asking you, when you use the word
22 "widespread," there's a widespread belief that
23 smoking causes lung cancer, if half the people,
0202
1 hypothetically, believed it and half weren't
2 convinced, would that meet your definition of
3 widespread belief?
4
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
5 A. Well, if one out of two people believe
6 something, that is -- you know, by some
7 definitions that would be widespread. But I
8 don't have a precise definition of what
9 widespread is versus non-widespread. It's
10 rapidly growing, large numbers believe it, and
11 we're moving more and more in that direction.
12 And that's as early as 1960, which is ten years
13 after this research started to hit.
14 Q. You said some people would consider 50-50
15 to be widespread. I'm not interested in some.
16 I'm interested in you. Would you consider that
17 to be widespread?
18 A. I don't have a precise definition of
19 "widespread." I mean, I'm not a pollster and,
20 you know, I'm not a statistician, I'm not a
21 quantifier in terms of my training. I'm sure
22 they have some sort of definition of that.
23 Q. When you use the phrase "widespread," I'm
0203
1 simply trying to determine is that a real loose
2 phrase that could include everything from
3 25 percent of the people? Or is that something
4 that means, you know, I'm talking about 80
5 percent, 90 percent of the people? I'm trying to
6 get a feel for what "widespread" means when you
7 use it, which is a fair question. I need to know
8 what it means for you. I'm going to make one
9 more run at it. Do you -- in your use of the
10 phrase "widespread belief," would that include
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 half of the people?
12
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
13 A. I would say yes, that's widespread. I
14 wouldn't call that necessarily pervasive, I
15 wouldn't necessarily call that overwhelming. But
16 widespread? I don't know. We're talking about
17 semantics here. That would mean one out of two
18 people in every household, I guess, would believe
19 that, would have that belief. That's
20 significant.
21 Q. You said that wouldn't be pervasive. At
22 what level would you consider it, in your phrase,
23 pervasive?
0204
1 A. I certainly think, you know --
2 Q. Go ahead.
3
MR. COTTON: I'll object to the form.
4 A. I would certainly say that in 1954 with
5 90 percent awareness, that's significant. If
6 you're getting to that level, you know, it's
7 pervasive. But, again, I'm not a pollster, so
8 this is all sort of seat of the pants, you know,
9 what's the definition -- if you ask most folks
10 what's widespread, what's pervasive, what's
11 overwhelming, you're going to get all sorts of
12 different answers. And it's off-the-cuff here to
13 try to parse the distinctions between these, at
14 least for me anyway.
15 Q. Having said all that and not referring to
16 what other people may think, when you use
17 "pervasive," you're talking about around
18 90 percent; is that fair?
19
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
20 mischaracterizes his testimony.
21 A. I would certainly call that pervasive.
22 Q. And what I'm asking is, for it to be
23 pervasive, is that kind of your rough threshold,
0205
1 90 percent before I would call it pervasive?
2
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
3 mischaracterizes testimony.
4 A. I don't know if I have a specific threshold
5 that I'm looking at. I certainly know there's
6 high levels of awareness, and maybe some folks
7 wouldn't consider 90 percent high, but I
8 certainly would and we know those levels of
9 awareness were there as early as 1954, which is
10 four years after the research really started
11 hitting in a big way.
12 Q. We know that you would consider 90 percent
13 pervasive. Would you consider 80 percent to be
14 pervasive?
15
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
16 A. Again, I don't have a precise threshold on
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 pervasive. I haven't thought about that, and I
18 don't have a precise threshold. That's certainly
19 pretty overwhelming, I would say; but I don't
20 have a precise threshold.
21 Q. Are you familiar with Tex Williams, Smoke
22 Smoke Smoke?
23 A. Yes, I am.
0206
1 Q. Do you plan to talk about Smoke Smoke
2 Smoke?
3 A. Yes. As a matter of fact, I was thinking
4 about additional sources that didn't come to mind
5 when you asked me initially, and that would be
6 one. Popular song would be one.
7 Q. Tell me what you think the relevance to
8 your opinions are of Smoke Smoke Smoke.
9 A. Well, it's a song that is very popular,
10 recorded by a lot of different people including
11 Tex Williams, Lawrence Welk, Sammy Davis, Jr., et
12 cetera, and it communicates that, you know,
13 smoking is, you know, a deadly -- first of all, a
14 very strong habit, "slavery" is used, and a
15 deadly habit that can kill you. So that would be
16 certainly an example, and Karen Whitney said she
17 was familiar with the song, and other people in
18 her family, so it would be relevant to that, I
19 think.
20 Q. Was that a very popular song?
21 A. Oh, yes. I think it was number one on the
22 charts, and it's been re-recorded so many times
23 by so many different artists over the years.
0207
1 Q. I mean, is that the kind of song you would
2 expect to be played in the household? That
3 wouldn't be some adult song the kids couldn't
4 listen to; that's something everybody could sing
5 along with around the dinner table if it was on
6 the radio, right?
7 A. Yes. I would expect it to be something
8 people heard. You know, in these cases often
9 people ask about it, and over and over again they
10 say, "Yes, I've heard of that," especially if
11 they grew up during that era, it was out there.
12 Q. And in that same era in your research, were
13 you aware of any other song that dealt with hard
14 drug addiction that would have been acceptable
15 around the family dinner table for everyone to
16 play and sing as a perfectly acceptable household
17 song that made light of, in kind of a funny way,
18 addiction to any hard drugs?
19 A. I don't know if it was making light of it.
20 I would disagree with that. I guess it used
21 sarcasm. It used humor, so I guess you could say
22 that flippant humor could be pretty devastating
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 and unsettling. I'm not aware of any songs about
0208
1 drug addiction during that period, per se.
2 Q. What do you make of when somebody hears
3 this song -- have you watched the song? Do you
4 have a collage of different people singing it?
5 A. I don't have a collage, but I've seen,
6 certainly, many of the different people sing it.
7 I've listened to it, different renditions.
8 Q. And you're suggesting this is a
9 dead-serious song? It's not a light-hearted
10 song, making fun of --
11 A. It uses humor, but humor can be used -- is
12 often very unsettling. The humor against the
13 Vietnam war, for example, MASH, right, something
14 like that, very unsettling.
15 Q. Do you know of any other songs involving
16 hard drug addiction that would have been
17 acceptable to sing around the family table in
18 this timeframe -- back in that timeframe, that
19 used humor, talking about --
20 A. Songs that are specifically clearly about
21 drug addiction, I can't think of many songs at
22 all. You've certainly got people who have
23 theories "This song meant that," and so forth.
0209
1 But songs that are very explicit like this, I
2 can't think of any examples offhand. I'm sure
3 they're there, but I can't think of them. As to
4 whether they're around the dinner table, again, I
5 can't think of any songs that would fit that
6 definition.
7 Q. But this song certainly is discussing,
8 regardless of the tone of the song, a powerful,
9 nearly impossible addiction to give up, right?
10 A. Yes. They use the term "nicotine slaves"
11 in it, sure. "Slave" is a pretty strong
12 expression.
13 Q. And you say this also suggested it's
14 deadly?
15 A. Yes. He's talking about -- again, I need
16 to listen to it again, but he's talking about
17 meeting St. Peter, right, and he says, "I just
18 want another cigarette."
19 Q. Do you recall it actually saying it's not
20 harmful to your health?
21 A. I think he makes an offhanded thing, like
22 "I reckon it hasn't done me any harm," then he
23 goes into all this harm that it does.
0210
1 Q. Really? What other harm does he go into?
2 I'm curious.
3 A. Well, again, stressing that it's like
4 slavery. Nicotine slave, that's certainly
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 addiction.
6 Q. I'm talking about other than being
7 addictive. I'm talking about health harms aside
8 and separate from addiction.
9 A. Well, I need to review the song, but I know
10 it's certainly the thing in there about
11 St. Peter, you know, he's going to meet
12 St. Peter.
13 Q. What does he say about St. Peter that
14 suggests -- is he suggesting that the cigarettes
15 caused him to die from lung cancer or disease?
16 Is that the way you read it?
17 A. Not lung cancer but, yes, I think it is
18 suggestive that the cigarettes, you know, killed
19 him. And he's going to see St. Peter and look,
20 he still wants another cigarette.
21 Q. "I'm a fellow with a heart of gold in the
22 ways of the gentleman I've been told, kind of a
23 guy that wouldn't even harm a flea. But if me
0211
1 and a certain character met, the guy that
2 invented that cigarette, I would murder that son
3 of a gun in the first degree. It ain't cause I
4 don't smoke 'em myself, and I don't reckon it'll
5 hinder your health. I've smoked them all my
6 life, and I ain't dead yet." Let's stop there.
7 Does that sound like he's saying they're lethal
8 to your health?
9 A. It sounds like it's portraying this is a
10 guy that's, to use the expression, sort of in
11 denial.
12 Q. "It ain't cause I don't smoke 'em myself,
13 and I don't reckon that it'll hinder your health.
14 I've smoked them all my life, and I ain't dead
15 yet. But nicotine slaves are all the same at a
16 pettin' party or a poker game. Everything gotta
17 stop when they have a cigarette." Now, does that
18 sound like it's about addiction, or these things
19 will kill you because they're dangerous to your
20 health?
21
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
22 Q. Which does that sound like to you?
23 A. Well, again, the part about St. Peter is
0212
1 the part that I --
2 Q. We're going to get there.
3 A. That sounds like -- I think you could
4 portray that as somebody that is maybe in a bit
5 of -- he's poking humor, using humor to say, you
6 know, "I'm a nicotine slave, but it hasn't done
7 me any harm." You could see that as somebody
8 who's sort of in a little bit of denial and
9 making fun of that in a certain sense.
10 Q. Of course, "Smoke smoke smoke that
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 cigarette, puff puff puff until you smoke
12 yourself to death. Tell St. Peter at the golden
13 gate that you hate to make him wait, but you just
14 got to have another cigarette." Is that the
15 St. Peter's part you're talking about?
16 A. Yes. "Smoke smoke smoke yourself to
17 death," yes. Death.
18 Q. "Tell St. Peter at the golden gate that you
19 hate to make him wait, but you just gotta have
20 another cigarette." He's telling "When I die,
21 St. Peter can wait because I've gotta have
22 another cigarette," isn't he?
23
MR. COTTON: Object to the form. That's
0213
1 not all that he's saying in that verse.
2 Q. Isn't that what he's saying? Maybe I'm
3 wrong.
4
MR. COTTON: Object to the form. The song
5 speaks for itself as far as what it says.
6 A. "Smoke smoke smoke yourself to death."
7 Q. "I don't reckon that it will hinder your
8 health. I've smoked them all my life, and I
9 ain't dead yet." But he's going to smoke until
10 he's dead; and when he gets there, he's going to
11 tell St. Peter, "Hold on until I get another
12 cigarette"?
13 A. Because it's so powerful --
14 Q. All that to say, this is a song about
15 cigarettes are bad for your health and kill you,
16 as opposed to a song about nicotine addiction?
17 That's how you read it?
18
MR. COTTON: Object to the form. Dr. Beito
19 doesn't have the entire song in front of him.
20 Can you read the chorus back to him, please?
21 Q. I just read the whole thing. I'll start
22 from the beginning, if you want.
23
MR. COTTON: What is the chorus of that
0214
1 song?
2 Q. I'm asking you when you get up in front of
3 the jury, do you intend to tell them this is a
4 song telling everybody how cigarettes are bad for
5 your health and kill you, as opposed to a song
6 making fun of addiction?
7
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
8 A. "Smoke smoke smoke yourself to death," I
9 think that's a very telling line. And he's also
10 sort of saying, "Look, it's like people we know,
11 they have to have a cigarette even though they
12 know it's going to kill them." They just keep
13 smoking because it's so powerful. That is
14 another thing he's communicating. Okay? "This
15 has got me in its grip here; and even if I'm
16 going to die, I'm going to keep smoking."
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 Q. And that would be your understanding from
18 your research of what smokers' experience with
19 nicotine had been, and it had made it into the
20 public domain through songs like this; is that
21 correct?
22
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
23 A. That would be one example, yes.
0215
1 Q. Are you aware that the same side that hired
2 you has got an addiction expert who is going to
3 come in and treat nicotine addiction as some
4 very, very, very light addiction nowhere, no
5 shape related to serious addictions like our
6 drugs? Are you aware of that?
7 A. I'm not a pharmacologist. I haven't done
8 research on that issue. I'm not aware of that.
9 Q. If he were to do that, that would not
10 square with your investigation as to the actual
11 experiences that smokers have with cigarettes,
12 would it?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection, form, beyond the
14 scope. You're asking now about a medical issue.
15 Q. No. I'm just asking hypothetically, if
16 someone were to say that, that doesn't square
17 with your investigation as to the experience
18 expressed of actual smokers that made it into the
19 public domain, correct?
20
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
21 A. I'm talking about certainly smokers are
22 often saying that this is a very powerful habit.
23 Again, I don't know the distinctions in the
0216
1 literature between habit and addiction. I think
2 there are people that would argue habits can be
3 very overpowering and addiction is more a
4 pharmacological term that doesn't apply, and so
5 forth. But I'm not an expert in that area.
6 Q. I'm not asking you to give me your opinion
7 on whether it's addictive or a habit or anything
8 like that.
9
MR. COTTON: Well, no, you are. You are
10 asking him to critique his opinion as a historian
11 compared to a medical opinion.
12 Q. Let me just ask you a hypothetical. If
13 someone were to say this is some lighthearted
14 addiction that is nothing serious like any of the
15 hard drug addiction, nowhere near as hard to
16 quit, not remotely, shouldn't be compared at all,
17 just hypothetically if someone were to say that,
18 that would not be consistent with the experience
19 of actual smokers that you've found from your
20 investigation that made it into the public
21 domain, would it?
22
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 A. I'm not somebody who is qualified to
0217
1 comment on how addictive heroin is versus
2 cocaine, to what extent stress plays in those
3 addictions and people getting off of it. I
4 certainly know there are a lot of people that
5 have quit smoking. There are a lot more
6 ex-smokers in the United States now than smokers,
7 so it is a habit that people can quit.
8 Q. Okay. But that's not remotely close to
9 what I asked. Let me just ask you a different
10 question. You told me before, your experience
11 from all of this was that people were expressing
12 an experience with smoking that was an addiction
13 to a drug that was in the same realm as hard
14 drugs, and that's what made it into the public
15 domain from your investigation. You've already
16 told me that in this deposition, did you not?
17 A. I said that the textbooks would often make
18 that comparison, that it would group it under the
19 category. They wouldn't necessarily argue it was
20 as addictive, but they would put it in the
21 category of narcotics.
22 Q. And I asked you also, was that the
23 experience of smokers that was being reported
0218
1 into the public domain, and you told me, "Yes,"
2 did you not?
3 A. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. There were
4 people, including in the depositions and with
5 this family, who said, "I quit." You know, it
6 wasn't that hard, wasn't that big a deal. There
7 are others who said, "Boy, it was hard." So you
8 get a mix of responses. You get some people, you
9 know, that are able to quit pretty easily. My
10 father was an example of that.
11 Q. We're not talking about individuals. I'm
12 not asking you to critique an individual. I'm
13 talking about what you found the pervasive belief
14 in the public was, that it was a powerful
15 addiction that had a grip on you that was very
16 hard to get off, not impossible, equivalent to
17 that of hard drugs, and that was a public
18 perception based on experience, that you found in
19 general. Did you not tell me that?
20
MR. COTTON: Objection to form,
21 mischaracterizes testimony.
22 A. I said it was grouped under narcotics. I
23 don't know that I quite said it was equivalent.
0219
1 If I did, I'm not an expert on that. I'm not a
2 pharmacologist. I haven't looked into whether
3 it's equivalent to heroin, opium, whatever, in
4 terms of the power of the habit.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 Q. And from your reading, that was the
6 impression that the general public had of
7 nicotine addiction, starting all the way through
8 the turn of the century up?
9
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
10 Q. To currently, right?
11
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
12 A. I wasn't necessarily comparing it to other
13 drugs. I was saying that they thought this is a
14 very difficult habit to break, but I can break
15 it. Others have done it, but it is a very
16 difficult habit. I wasn't really looking at it
17 with reference to other drugs or anything, and
18 how they do with other drugs. Except it was
19 grouped under narcotics in the textbooks, and
20 sometimes they run comparisons.
21 Q. Sir, I'm curious. You, without
22 equivocation, told me earlier in the deposition
23 how powerful an addiction this was in the minds
0220
1 of the public from your investigation, how they
2 thought it had a powerful grip, not impossible to
3 stop but a powerful grip, very strong addiction
4 and an addiction to a drug known as nicotine, and
5 that was the general understanding of the public
6 from the turn of the century. Did you tell me
7 that?
8 A. I also told you early on --
9 Q. Did you tell me that? Sir?
10 A. -- that there were people that found it
11 easy to quit.
12
MR. COTTON: Object. You have to let
13 him --
14 Q. Did you tell me that? I want an answer to
15 my question.
16
MR. COTTON: Keith, stop. Keith, you need
17 to let him answer your question; and then if you
18 have another question, you can ask the next one.
19
MR. MITNIK: He can answer and then he
20 can explain.
21 Q. Did you not --
22
MR. LEPPERT: Will you try not to talk over
23 each other, please?
0221
1
MR. MITNIK: Yes. Sure.
2 Q. Read my question back, and I'd like you to
3 answer it, please.
4
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
5 portion of the testimony was read back by the
6 court reporter.)
7
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
8 A. I said that, but I also emphasize there
9 were people that said, "Hey, you know, it wasn't
10 that hard to quit." So people are different.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 But it certainly was perceived and warnings were
12 repeated often, this can be a very difficult
13 habit for people. But not all people necessarily
14 found it difficult to quit smoking. Some found
15 it hard, some didn't find it as hard, so I think
16 people vary. But there was a belief that it
17 could be very habit-forming; that you better be
18 careful with this.
19 Q. What conclusions did you reach in your
20 investigation as to why so many people were
21 picking up smoking when it was a common knowledge
22 and understanding that it could be powerfully
23 addictive and kill you?
0222
1
MR. COTTON: Object to form, beyond the
2 scope.
3 A. Again, I didn't look at that issue. I
4 looked at, you know, what was the level of
5 awareness. You can make information available to
6 people. If they want to take that information,
7 that's ultimately their choice, I think.
8 Q. But smoking was taking off skyrocketing in
9 the turn of the century. Did you do anything in
10 your list, as a historian looking into it, how
11 would I swear that everybody basically knew this
12 stuff is powerfully addictive and kills you, yet
13 it was skyrocketing in sales? Did you try to
14 square those two in any way, shape, or form?
15
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
16 A. It's an interesting question; but, again,
17 that was not the area that I did the research in.
18 As I said, it might be there was a more
19 fatalistic attitude; but, again, this would be
20 off-the-cuff, seat of the pants.
21 Q. So the answer is, no, you did not
22 investigate that question at all to test the
23 validity of your opinions that everybody knew
0223
1 they would kill you and they were highly
2 addictive?
3
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
4 Q. Did you look into that to test the validity
5 of your opinion?
6
MR. COTTON: Object to form, beyond the
7 scope.
8 A. For me, the important question was
9 awareness. And I think the evidence is
10 overwhelming that Americans were well aware that
11 it was a deadly habit, it could kill you, and
12 were presented with that information over the
13 years, and that that information was presented in
14 environments where Karen Whitney lived by a
15 number of different sources.
16 Q. My question is, did you look into that to
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 test the validity of your conclusions?
18
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19 A. No.
20 Q. Huh? No?
21 A. No.
22 Q. At some point did the number of smokers
23 quit rising and start declining?
0224
1 A. I think as I said before, according to
2 polls I've seen, it peaked at 45 percent of the
3 adult population in '54, and then the numbers
4 don't ever get that high again as far as I saw.
5 They're moving downward.
6 Q. And did you investigate why?
7 A. No. I'm focusing on public awareness.
8 Q. Did you see in your investigation as to the
9 cigarette industry attacking the credibility of
10 the surgeon general and public health officials?
11
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
12 A. I've certainly seen what reached the press;
13 and to the extent there were industry statements,
14 I saw those. You know, again, they would tend to
15 emphasize association. Often the response to the
16 '64 report was, they would try to sort of -- not
17 attack Luther Terry, they would just sort of say,
18 "Well, he said more research is needed, and we
19 agree with him," you know, things like that.
20 Q. Did you read the Frank Statement?
21 A. Yes, I did.
22 Q. What was your impression of what that
23 document was? What was the purpose of it?
0225
1
MR. COTTON: Object to the form, calls for
2 speculation.
3 A. Well, the document appears in --
4 Q. Let me strike that. Not what the purpose
5 of it was. What the result of it was.
6 A. I don't see much evidence that it had much
7 of a result at all. It appears on one day in
8 newspapers -- I forget what the circulation had
9 to be, or the size of the metropolitan area, a
10 certain number, at least 50,000, something like
11 that. So it appears on one day across the
12 country in a newspaper. Certainly, if you look
13 at the depositions, I don't know if there was a
14 single person that had ever heard of it. That's
15 my general experience, I don't think it made much
16 of an impression.
17 Q. Do you think that there are things that can
18 be widespread that actually get into the fabric
19 of the basic information out there at the time
20 that you don't have to actually see it or hear it
21 specifically to know it?
22 A. What would be an example of that, do you
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 think?
0226
1 Q. I'll give you an example. Do you think
2 someone had to hear the surgeon general speak or
3 read his report in 1964 to have it reach them --
4 because the effects of it would have trickled out
5 into society, and you would have been hearing,
6 "Goodness gracious, they're saying that there's a
7 direct link between smoking and -- lung cancer
8 and smoking," without actually visually --
9 hearing him or reading the report?
10 A. Sure, that could be the case.
11 Q. What do you call that phenomenon?
12 A. I don't know what the name for that
13 phenomenon would be. Information trickling down
14 thirdhand, fourthhand, et cetera, multiple
15 sources of information.
16 Q. Do you believe that the cigarette
17 companies' counter message to the public health
18 officials that smoking caused lung cancer, the
19 counter message that started with the Frank
20 Statement saying it hasn't been true, but we need
21 more research, after the trickle down secondhand
22 effect where you didn't have to actually read it,
23 but that together with the push of the cigarette
0227
1 companies would have trickled down for second and
2 thirdhand knowledge, that cigarette companies
3 were debating and contesting and there was a
4 controversy about whether or not it actually
5 caused lung cancer?
6
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
7 A. Again, that's a hard thing to prove one way
8 or the other, but if poll data is any indication,
9 if the news coverage is any indication, there was
10 more emphasis in the coming years, the late '50s,
11 mid to late '50s, on the dangers of smoking, and
12 belief level increased.
13 Q. There was a secondhand or trickle down
14 effect of things like the Frank Statement that
15 most people in society would have heard that
16 cigarette companies are contesting this?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to form, calls for
18 speculation, lack of foundation.
19 A. I don't know if they would need the Frank
20 Statement for that, because you certainly will
21 see -- although it's dwindling numbers, you do
22 see the articles -- if you work your way all the
23 way to the end of the article, you may see an
0228
1 industry comment. You know, if you're a close
2 reader of the newspaper, you may see that if you
3 work your way down beyond the headline and beyond
4 the body of the story.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 Q. How about Meet the Nation? Do you have to
6 work your way to the bottom to see cigarette
7 executives on Meet the Nation?
8
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
9 Q. Or other various widely watched TV shows
10 back when we only had three TV stations?
11
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
12 A. No.
13 Q. Do you think a lot of people would have
14 been subjected to that?
15
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
16 A. Certainly. But those shows are
17 overwhelmingly communicating the message that
18 cigarette smoking is dangerous, it's bad for you,
19 and, you know, it's deadly. Sure, they're going
20 to be out there, but they're going to be very
21 much a minority position compared to what you're
22 seeing with the public health experts, government
23 officials, you name it, who are going on those
0229
1 shows.
2 Q. My question is, do you believe there was
3 enough -- whether it be in newspapers, magazines,
4 press releases, public statements in front of
5 banks of microphones, or on television shows, was
6 there enough coming from the totality of the
7 information being put out by the cigarette
8 industry or by TIRC or any of these other
9 industries that came from the cigarette industry
10 to create a general understanding that there was
11 another side to this story?
12
MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
13 foundation.
14 A. I don't see the evidence for that. I don't
15 see the evidence for that.
16 Q. So you would say, "No, it did not; there
17 was not enough information out there for there to
18 be a general understanding that there was another
19 side to this story"?
20 A. Because it's so overwhelming on the other
21 side, and the other side is becoming even more
22 overwhelming over time.
23 Q. Then how do you account for polls that show
0230
1 in the mid '60s so many Americans were still not
2 convinced --
3
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
4 Q. -- that smoking causes lung cancer?
5
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
6 A. Well, it's an interesting question. But
7 certainly, if the argument is that it's industry,
8 industry -- the industry is a very low estimation
9 as a source for information. And again, I think
10 that the levels of both awareness and belief are
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 increasing quite rapidly over time, so we have a
12 different opinion.
13 Q. We're going to just have to agree to
14 disagree that you think taking 30, 40 years to
15 reach 90 percent is like rocketship fast, and I
16 frankly don't agree. Let me ask you this. Have
17 you ever seen any polls, by any chance, on how
18 many people believe that there are aliens, that
19 there are spaceships?
20 A. I've certainly heard of polls like that.
21
MR. COTTON: Have you seen any polls about
22 that?
23 A. Yes, I've seen polls like that.
0231
1 Q. About 50 percent, right?
2
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
3 A. I don't remember what the percentage is.
4 Q. Whatever it is, do you think if aliens --
5 suddenly the U.S. government came out and we had
6 aliens landing on the front yard of the White
7 House and all the press coverage was there, and
8 everybody saw it and everybody knew it, do you
9 think if you polled America a year later, it
10 would still be out without 10 percent, now it's
11 going from hypothetically 50 to 60; or do you
12 think we'd be in a 95 percent, maybe there's a
13 handful of people that just won't? But wouldn't
14 you expect it to go up pretty quick if there was
15 a unified absolute message being addressed?
16 Wouldn't you?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to form, beyond the
18 scope, lack of foundation, calls for speculation.
19 A. If you want my speculation, certainly. If
20 you see aliens land on the lawn of the White
21 House, you're going to have a rapid spike in
22 those numbers.
23 Q. And how about if suddenly out of that anger
0232
1 that they say there's spacemen out somewhere in
2 the desert, the governor went on TV and President
3 Obama went on TV and said, "Look, we're sorry,
4 they've been hiding all these years, but there
5 really, really, are. We've got an alien craft
6 and an alien body out there." Do you think the
7 percentage would shoot up almost immediately?
8
MR. COTTON: I'm sorry. Can you read that
9 back, please?
10 Q. No, we don't need to read it back. Here is
11 my question. Do you think if suddenly the
12 government came out and admitted that we had an
13 alien and a spaceship out in the desert somewhere
14 that we had been concealing, and "Yes, we do have
15 it," and admitted it, that the poll would go way
16 up quickly, as to the number of people who
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 believe that there are UFOs and aliens?
18
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
19 A. Sounds logical.
20 Q. Why in this case, if your conclusions and
21 testimony are accurate that virtually everybody
22 believes smoking caused lung cancer, why did the
23 polls take twenty years to go up 20 percent, from
0233
1 less than 50 percent to somewhere around 70? Why
2 do you think so?
3
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
4 Q. Twenty years, two decades, why do you think
5 so?
6
MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
7 foundation, calls for speculation.
8 A. You know, it would be speculation on my
9 part. I haven't studied this issue.
10
MR. COTTON: He doesn't want you to
11 speculate.
12 A. Well, I haven't studied this issue. It's
13 outside of my research focus.
14 Q. Would your answer be, "I don't know why it
15 took twenty years"?
16 A. Sure. I do not know why it would take
17 twenty years. Well, could you repeat that again?
18 You know, what were you asking when I just
19 answered that?
20 Q. Sure. You don't know why it took -- you
21 don't have an opinion as to why it took twenty
22 years to rise 20 percent in people that believed
23 smoking caused lung cancer, given, according to
0234
1 you, there was really no contest left, it was a
2 foregone conclusion?
3
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
4 A. As to why it took twenty years, I have not
5 studied that.
6 Q. Okay. But you call that very rapid?
7 A. Yes, I do. You know, again, I think the
8 comparison between aliens and something like this
9 is -- well, I'm not sure that that works.
10 Q. Why not?
11 A. Well, aliens coming from outer space, I
12 mean, I'm just not sure it works as a comparison.
13 But in any case, my point is I have not studied
14 this issue.
15 Q. How does it impress you?
16 A. It impresses me as a rapid increase given
17 how recent the research was on the issue, the
18 recent findings were.
19 Q. Let me take cell phones. Have you heard
20 that using that cell phone, there are some people
21 that say that will cause a brain tumor?
22 A. I've heard that, yes.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 Q. Are there others that disagree?
0235
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. Is that a controversial subject?
3 A. I don't see it as a controversial subject.
4 Q. Why not?
5
MR. COTTON: Object to the form, way
6 outside your experience.
7 A. I haven't done research in that area. I
8 haven't done research in that area, and I think
9 that there have been some studies that have come
10 out, but then there have been other studies that
11 disagree with it. It's not getting the kinds of
12 coverage and kinds of emphasis and kinds of
13 credible people behind it, like the American
14 Cancer Society. It's not getting people like
15 these leading public health organizations,
16 surgeon general. It's not getting, you know, the
17 emphasis in the media. It's not getting the
18 emphasis from leading scientists of kind of
19 uniformity. So I think it's a big difference.
20 Now, if you got that same kind of emphasis, you
21 know, that would be a different matter. But
22 again, I haven't studied that issue, but that's
23 my sense, that it hasn't gotten that kind of
0236
1 credibility behind it.
2 Q. But if it did, hypothetically, tomorrow you
3 pick up every newspaper in America, AT&T,
4 Verizon, whatever the other phone people, all
5 came forward and said, "It's true, it's true,
6 they cause brain tumors," and the surgeon general
7 and the American Cancer Society --
8
MR. COTTON: Hey, we lost your sound,
9 Keith.
10
(Off-the-record discussion.)
11 Q. Where we left off is, if suddenly AT&T and
12 all the other major phone manufacturers came out
13 and said it does cause brain tumors, and public
14 health and the American Cancer Society all said
15 it does, and there was a unified message from the
16 industry as well as public health, and you polled
17 it, would you expect a very rapid as in within a
18 month, days, certainly within a year, that you
19 would be hearing 90-plus percent would believe
20 the phones caused brain tumors? Everybody from
21 industry and the health side all agree and said
22 it publicly.
23
MR. COTTON: Object to form, calls for
0237
1 speculation.
2 A. It's just speculation, and I certainly
3 would expect the belief levels to go up under the
4 circumstances or everybody is coming out. But
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 then again, people are very dependent on their
6 cell phones as well, and a lot of people might
7 just keep using them regardless.
8 Q. I didn't ask you about whether they kept
9 using them. I didn't ask a word about whether
10 they quit using them or not. My question is,
11 would they accept and believe it's true that they
12 cause brain tumors if everybody, including the
13 manufacturers and the healthcare, public health
14 side, all announced it in unity, would you expect
15 ten years later for it to go from 40 percent to
16 50 percent believe?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
18 foundation, calls for speculation.
19 A. Again, this is speculation. I would expect
20 it would rapidly increase. I don't know what
21 level it would reach, but the percentage of
22 people that believe it would go up; although, you
23 might have some countervailing people that just
0238
1 want to use their cell phones and don't want to
2 believe it.
3
MR. COTTON: Mr. Beito, he doesn't want you
4 to guess or speculate.
5 A. I'm guessing there, and I'm not going to
6 guess. That's what I'm doing, really. It's
7 speculation, guessing.
8 Q. So here it took thirty years to get into
9 the 90 percent believe it, you would call that
10 rapid?
11
MR. COTTON: I'm sorry. Can you repeat it
12 or have her read it back?
13 Q. Under that hypothetical, you would consider
14 it taking thirty years to go from 40 percent to
15 90-plus percent to be a rapid movement to
16 believe?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
18 A. I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. I guess
19 it just depends on -- you know, I haven't faced
20 that -- we haven't faced that situation. It's
21 completely a hypothetical, and people are very
22 dependent on their cell phones, far more, I
23 think, than they were dependent on tobacco. So I
0239
1 don't know how they would respond. There might
2 be a lot of people -- there probably would be a
3 lot of people that would just not want to believe
4 it.
5 Q. When is the first time the cigarette
6 industry publicly acknowledged smoking caused
7 lung cancer?
8 A. It was around the turn of the century.
9 2000, around there. 1999, 2000.
10 Q. What took them so long, in you research?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
12 A. I haven't researched that. I haven't
13 studied that.
14
MR. COTTON: Calls for speculation.
15 Q. Well, if everybody out in the street
16 (unintelligible) that everybody knew, wouldn't
17 you think they knew too?
18 A. Yes. I haven't done research on that.
19 Q. I'm just asking. You think everybody knew
20 but the cigarette industry that they cause lung
21 cancer?
22
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
23 A. Well, I wouldn't quite say everybody knew
0240
1 it, but it was an overwhelming percentage of the
2 population.
3 Q. Do you think the overwhelming percentage of
4 the population excludes the cigarette companies?
5 A. No. I can't read people's minds, and I've
6 not -- what I'm doing is looking at levels of
7 awareness, and I see a tremendous increase in
8 levels of awareness by the general public, by
9 people -- Whitney's family, by, you know, all
10 these venues. I see this increasing over time.
11 That's what I've looked at, levels of awareness,
12 and I'm not a mind reader. I haven't done
13 research on the industry, so I don't have the
14 kind of empirical basis to make an informed
15 judgment.
16 Q. But you are making a judgment about the
17 population as a whole, are you not?
18 A. Based on a lot of different sources, yes.
19 But not any -- I'm not looking at, you know, why
20 people move in a particular direction. I've
21 pointed out mainly that they're being exposed to
22 this information on a massive level, and that is
23 being reflected by increasing belief. But I'm
0241
1 not doing psychology, I'm not doing internal
2 industry analysis.
3 Q. I'm not asking you to. I'm asking you,
4 when you talk about the public as a whole, this
5 being widespread.
6
(Off-the-record discussion.)
7 Q. When you talk about the public as a whole,
8 do you have any reason to not consider the
9 individual people that work at the cigarette
10 companies and are executives at the cigarette
11 companies to somehow be excluded from mainstream
12 America as far as the usage you've expressed? Do
13 you have any reason in your research to treat
14 them any differently than anybody else who was
15 living in mainstream America to die, as far as
16 public awareness?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
18 A. No, I don't. But again, my focus is not on
19 why does somebody believe something, why don't
20 they believe it. I'm looking at what they're
21 exposed to. And what we see is the public is
22 being exposed to this high and intense level of
23 information that cigarette smoking is dangerous,
0242
1 that it could kill you, that it's extremely
2 habit-forming for many people, and that this is
3 increasing in intensity over time. That's what I
4 did research on, quite a bit of research.
5 Q. Move to strike. Nonresponsive. I'll ask
6 you to read the question back, please.
7
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
8 portion of the testimony was read back by the
9 court reporter.)
10
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
11 A. As I think I said, no, I don't have any
12 reason. They're part of the public.
13 Q. And from your research, did you see any
14 explanation for why the cigarette companies were
15 not admitting smoking caused lung cancer?
16 A. My research focused on awareness, so what
17 reached the media, what reached the public, those
18 are the issues I was looking at, so I was not
19 looking at that issue. You know, certainly there
20 are historians that could look at that that could
21 specialize in history of the industry, and so
22 forth, but that wasn't what I was doing.
23 Q. Move to strike, nonresponsive. I'll ask
0243
1 the court reporter to read the question back.
2
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
3 portion of the testimony was read back by the
4 court reporter.)
5
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
6 A. In the media sources I looked at, I didn't
7 see -- you know, I didn't see that issue
8 analyzed. I didn't see that issue studied. I
9 mean, I was focusing on what levels of public
10 awareness were.
11 Q. Do you have an opinion one way or the other
12 as to whether anything the cigarette companies
13 were doing was an explanation for why the
14 percentage only rose 10 percent from the mid '50s
15 to the '60s in the number of people who believed
16 lung cancer was a result of smoking?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
18 A. I didn't study internal tobacco documents
19 and what the industry was doing in terms of
20 strategy.
21 Q. Do you have an opinion -- strike that.
22 Please, I move to strike the answer, and I would
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 ask Madam Court Reporter to read the question
0244
1 back.
2
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
3 portion of the testimony was read back by the
4 court reporter.)
5
MR. COTTON: Again, I'll object to the
6 form. It's been asked and answered. He just
7 said he didn't look at that question.
8 A. I do not have an opinion because I have not
9 looked at the question. As a researcher, I want
10 to do the research. And my research is focused
11 on awareness.
12 Q. Do you have any opinion, if it was not
13 something the cigarette companies were doing, as
14 to why it took so long to reach 90 percent of the
15 people who believed smoking caused cancer?
16
MR. COTTON: Object to form, out of scope.
17 A. As I said, no, I didn't look at that issue;
18 and that issue as well, I did not look at.
19 Q. From your investigation, was it big news, a
20 significant news item when the surgeon general in
21 1988 said nicotine addiction -- how nicotine was
22 addictive, was an addictive drug?
23 A. It was a big story, top of the hour.
0245
1 Q. If everybody had known that since the turn
2 of the century, what is your conclusion as to why
3 it was such a big news story?
4
MR. COTTON: Object to form, calls for
5 speculation.
6 A. Well, again, I'm not a pharmacologist, but
7 a habit, people use the term "habit," people use
8 the term "addiction," and sometimes when you're
9 using the term "habit," you may say, "Look, this
10 is a powerful habit," so people knew that.
11 Addiction is something that is -- I'm looking at
12 the popular use of it, which was usually used to
13 describe a habit that was extremely difficult to
14 break; but you had people, you know, using the
15 term "habit" as well to describe it. I'm not
16 looking at the pharmacological definition, as I
17 believe Koop was driving at. I'm not an expert
18 in that. I'm looking at more how it appeared to
19 be used in the popular press.
20 Q. How did the public react to it, from your
21 investigation? What was the public's attitude or
22 reaction towards that release of information?
23 A. Well, again, my focus has been on the
0246
1 earlier period, but I think the public had always
2 believed that it was a very difficult habit to
3 break. So was it more of a difference of just
4 terminology? I mean, those terms are almost used
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 interchangeably by people. And I think that's
6 still the case, by and large. When people use
7 the term "addiction," they're not necessarily
8 thinking about the pharmacological aspects of
9 that. When they use the term "habit," they're
10 not necessarily dismissing that as well.
11 Q. Did you look into the public reaction to
12 this big news item of the surgeon general saying
13 it was as addictive as heroin?
14 A. Not specifically, no. I certainly took
15 note of that, and I read the publication -- some
16 of the leading publications that discussed that.
17 But I'm, again, focusing more on the issue of
18 awareness. That story was already widely
19 believed that this was an overpowering habit for
20 many people, very difficult; and the term
21 "addiction" versus the term "habit," you know,
22 again, I'm not a pharmacologist, but I know that
23 that's what people meant when they used that
0247
1 term. Or, you know, what they would say they
2 meant.
3 Q. That big news story when the surgeon
4 general in '88 made the announcement that, in
5 fact, nicotine was addictive and is as addictive
6 as heroin got a lot of follow-up media, did it
7 not? It was a hot news story?
8 A. It was a big news story. Not as big, I
9 think, as when the surgeon general's report first
10 came out, but it was big.
11 Q. How do you swear that would be such a big
12 story if since the turn of the century, as you
13 told me, people saw nicotine as an addictive,
14 powerfully addictive drug?
15
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
16 Q. From the perspective of public awareness.
17 I don't want to talk about pharmacology. Purely
18 public awareness.
19
MR. COTTON: I'll object to the form.
20 A. Well, I think, you know, again, he's trying
21 to make a distinction between a very strong habit
22 and addiction. And I'm not so sure people
23 necessarily made that distinction. They were
0248
1 kind of interchangeable. So here is a guy
2 saying, "Oh, there's this distinction, and you've
3 got something here, addiction, that's much more
4 serious," and people probably took notice of that
5 more because he was going on the record. But I'm
6 speculating here, really, because that term
7 "addiction" was used a lot, the term "habit" was
8 used a lot, and they were used often
9 interchangeably before that.
10 Q. So would the answer be that in your
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 investigation you were unable to swear that being
12 such a hot news item when the surgeon general
13 said this is a real addiction in 1988, and your
14 conclusions that the public awareness since the
15 turn of the century was that everybody knew this
16 was a highly addictive drug that they were using?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to form, completely
18 mischaracterizes his testimony.
19 A. Again, the surgeon general is coming
20 forward and making this distinction, that a lot
21 of people maybe had not necessarily thought about
22 before, maybe not necessarily assumed was a
23 distinction between extremely strong habit and
0249
1 something that has a pharmacological definition,
2 which I think is what he was driving at. You
3 know, even now I think there's -- I've heard
4 people use the term "dependence," you know, for
5 rejecting addiction. So there's big debates
6 about terminology that are out there. What is
7 the proper terminology to use even today; should
8 it be dependence, should it be addiction, should
9 it be habit? But, you know, the important thing
10 I take away from it is people understood that
11 this could be very difficult, to quit smoking.
12 People joked about it, they commented on it all
13 the time, it was emphasized. The song Smoke
14 Smoke Smoke is an example of that.
15 Q. Let's go back. Are you now saying that the
16 public awareness before this announcement by the
17 surgeon general in 1988 was that this was a habit
18 that could be hard to break, but not necessarily
19 a drug addiction?
20
MR. COTTON: Objection, form,
21 mischaracterizes his testimony.
22 A. You get both. You get both. I'm talking
23 about the popular use of it, and the popular use
0250
1 of it isn't necessarily where they're thinking
2 about all the scientific implications. They just
3 say, "Hey, it's difficult to break that."
4 Q. I'm not asking about scientific
5 implications. I'm asking about, you told me that
6 the public awareness from the turn of the century
7 was that this was a highly addictive drug, did
8 you not?
9 A. That it was -- that it was a habit that was
10 very difficult to break, certainly.
11 Q. That's what I'm trying to get at.
12 A. And sometimes "addiction" would be used as
13 shorthand. Other people would use the term
14 "habit." And again, I'm not a pharmacologist,
15 okay. "Is it really an addiction, or is it a
16 habit," you know, what is the distinction between
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 them? I haven't done research on that. I look
18 at the popular use.
19 Q. I'm going to ask you the following
20 questions, and I'll ask you to please stop adding
21 "I'm not a pharmacologist." I want to make it
22 perfectly clear so there's no confusion. I know
23 you're not a pharmacologist, I'm not asking you
0251
1 expert pharmacology opinions. I'm not asking
2 about scientific distinctions between terms. I'm
3 asking about something you're here opining on,
4 which is public awareness. And you do know
5 public awareness, right?
6 A. Yes. And the public, I think, did not
7 necessarily make a distinction between the two.
8 Addiction would probably be emphasized as a word
9 really underlying how difficult it is, but that
10 they would use the word, you know, "overpowering
11 habit" as well. They'd use words like "slaves."
12 They'd use all sorts of words. I don't know how
13 much thought they gave into these fine
14 distinctions between them.
15 Q. I just want to know your opinion. Is it
16 your opinion that from the turn of the century --
17
MR. COTTON: If you want his opinion, why
18 don't you just ask him what his opinion is?
19
MR. MITNIK: Because goodness gracious, I
20 don't want to sit here for 30 minutes. I want to
21 get some answers.
22 Q. Is it your opinion from the turn of the
23 century that there was public awareness that
0252
1 there was a drug in cigarettes called nicotine
2 that was highly addictive, or that people
3 thought, as a general public awareness, "This is
4 a habit that could be hard to break"?
5
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
6 Q. Which is it?
7
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
8 A. I think so. And I would even say, you
9 know, earlier than the turn of the century. As I
10 said, Columbus observes that the Native Americans
11 are bewitched, which sounds a lot to me like kind
12 of an addiction argument, if you want to use
13 that. Or at least the term that this is a really
14 difficult habit for them to break.
15 Q. Move to strike, and ask you to read my
16 question back.
17
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
18 portion of the testimony was read back by the
19 court reporter.)
20
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. That's an either-or. "Yes" doesn't work.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23
MR. COTTON: Well, he doesn't have to
0253
1 articulate his opinion either-or the way that you
2 framed it.
3 A. I think it was both. I mean, I think
4 people believe both things.
5 Q. Okay. So which --
6 A. I guess I didn't understand the question,
7 because I didn't see it as either-or.
8 Q. From a perspective of public awareness, is
9 it your opinion that people by the turn of the
10 century believed that nicotine was a highly
11 addictive drug as a matter of public awareness?
12 Not an individual matter, a matter of overall
13 public awareness.
14
MR. COTTON: Now I'll object to the form.
15 A. Or, you know, the property or the drug in
16 cigarettes that helped to create the habit. You
17 know, people believed both things, and they used
18 the terms "addiction" and "habit" often
19 interchangeably. So it's hard to say if you were
20 to ask someone in 1900, "Is it an addiction or a
21 habit," it's a very good chance they would say
22 both at different times, right, and they would
23 use "addiction" to describe kind of a shorthand
0254
1 of an overpowering habit, or vice versa. I don't
2 think they made these absolute, you know,
3 gradations here.
4 Q. When you say there was public awareness,
5 what do you mean?
6 A. I mean that the information was very much
7 out there; that scientists, that people who --
8 just ordinary people had found cigarettes to be a
9 very difficult habit to break. I think people's
10 family members would inform them. They would get
11 this from textbooks; they'd get this from the
12 media; they'd get this from a popular song;
13 they'd get this from a lot of different sources.
14 They'd get it from slang phrases like "little
15 white slaver," or Henry Ford distributing his
16 pamphlet, Little White Slaver, at all of his auto
17 dealerships. They would get it from all sorts of
18 different sources. Anti-cigarette leagues that
19 were formed during the late nineteenth, early
20 twentieth century would be disseminating that
21 message. So this was very much out there from a
22 lot of different sources.
23 Q. Maybe I misunderstood your public
0255
1 awareness. Let me be clear. When you say there
2 was general public awareness, you just mean there
3 was information out there sufficient enough that
4 you had heard it, not necessarily that the public
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 had agreed with the message. Is that right?
6 A. I just don't -- I don't know if I've ever
7 seen anybody really say, "Well, that's not a
8 difficult habit for anybody." They might say, "I
9 could take it or leave it as an individual," but
10 I've never heard anyone actually say that is
11 not -- you know, if you were to bring it up, "Is
12 that an overpowering habit for many people?" "Is
13 it an addiction for many people?" I don't know.
14 We don't have poll data, but I don't see anyone
15 disputing that when they discuss this issue.
16 Q. I'm talking about a general term here, sir.
17 I'm not even talking about addiction right now.
18 Listen to my question. I'm asking you about what
19 you mean generally when you talk about public
20 awareness. It sounds like when you say "public
21 awareness," you don't mean that there's a general
22 acceptance by the public. You mean there's
23 general exposure to the public. Am I right?
0256
1
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
2 A. Yes, in general, although I think on this
3 particular issue as to whether it's
4 habit-forming, you know, can be habit-forming for
5 many people, again, we don't have poll data, but
6 I just see it as almost taken for granted by
7 people; that this is -- I just haven't seen
8 people saying, "Gee, this is not a habit," you
9 know. I've heard people say, "Well, it's not
10 difficult for me."
11 Q. Right. We can agree that for purposes of
12 this question, hypothetically, I accept your
13 premise that there was a general understanding
14 that smoking could be a habit that was hard to
15 break, okay? Are you with me so far?
16 A. Okay.
17 Q. What I want to know is, do you believe
18 there was a general understanding that it wasn't
19 just a habit that could be hard to break, but
20 that it was a strong -- strike that -- that it
21 was a powerful drug addiction?
22 A. I think there is an under- -- yes, I would
23 say so in terms of nicotine being emphasized.
0257
1 People talk about nicotine all the time as the
2 active ingredient that is drawing people in.
3 Now, how powerful, I guess people might have some
4 degrees of that, but certainly I believe that it
5 could be very powerful in individual cases and
6 it, you know, could be difficult to break.
7 Q. So using a definition of the public having
8 a general acceptance or belief that nicotine was
9 a powerfully addictive drug, is that your
10 opinion?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11
MR. COTTON: I'm sorry. Will you repeat
12 that?
13 Q. I'll rephrase it. It's a little awkward
14 question. Is it your opinion that there was a
15 general public acceptance or belief that nicotine
16 was a powerfully addictive drug?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
18 A. I don't know if they used the term "drug"
19 so much, but they were certainly aware that
20 nicotine was -- there was a general belief that
21 this was the source of why there's a habit here,
22 right? It has a lot to do with it, the nicotine,
23 and it can be very powerful. Was it put on the
0258
1 same level necessarily as heroin, and so forth,
2 you know, that's a different question. But
3 certainly it was emphasized that this could be a
4 very powerful habit, very difficult habit to
5 break, and the nicotine was seen as the kind of
6 source of it, the main source of it.
7 Q. Was it on the same level as hard drugs, in
8 your investigation? Is that your opinion?
9
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
10 A. Some people would say that. I don't know
11 if that would be the general case. You know, I
12 think people would disagree on that. But
13 certainly nobody -- very few people would shrink
14 from saying, "Boy, this person has really got a
15 problem here, they've got a habit." It's
16 difficult to break, that nicotine has something
17 to do with it.
18 Q. Would you say that it was a generally
19 accepted belief in society at the turn of the
20 century that nicotine was powerfully addictive?
21 A. Or habit-forming, I think that that's a
22 fair statement, based on what I've seen. Again,
23 we don't have a lot of poll data, but it's just
0259
1 taken for granted, from what I can see. So, yes,
2 I would say yes.
3 Q. And are you using, from the perspective of
4 public awareness, habit and addiction as
5 synonymous?
6 A. I think in the popular lexicon, they mixed
7 them back and forth. By addiction, you know,
8 they may have been just describing a habit that
9 was very difficult to break. Addiction might be
10 a way to emphasize that. But you see both terms
11 used, and people back between them. I don't
12 think they see a contradiction, necessarily,
13 between those.
14 Q. Well, you could chew gum and it be a habit.
15 That's not the same thing as having a cocaine
16 addiction --
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 A. Powerful habit.
18 Q. So you're not suggesting when you say
19 "habit," that people were trivializing it to be
20 like I have a habit of chewing gum, or I have a
21 habit of smoking coffee? That's not what you're
22 suggesting was the public awareness level?
23
MR. COTTON: Did you say "smoking coffee"?
0260
1 Q. I may have. Drinking coffee. You're not
2 suggesting that there's public awareness because
3 they used the word "habit" was trivializing it
4 down to like chewing gum or biting my fingernails
5 or drinking coffee, were you?
6 A. The overwhelming emphasis is that it's on a
7 different level than those habits.
8
(Whereupon, at this time a short break was
9 taken.)
10 Q. I have pulled out some Gallup polls. I
11 want to ask you about just a couple of them here.
12 We're going to start with a Gallup poll that was
13 July of 1969, and it asked -- all persons in this
14 survey were asked, "What is your opinion? Do you
15 think cigarette smoking is or is not one of the
16 causes of lung cancer?" And the answer was, "Is,
17 71 percent." For smokers, the answer for "Yes,
18 it is," was 59 percent. So for simple rounding,
19 it's approximately 70 percent, and 60 percent
20 were smokers, okay?
21 A. Uh-huh.
22 Q. And this is in the very end of the
23 '60s, 1969. First of all, to what do you
0261
1 attribute the difference between 70 percent and
2 60 percent from smokers to everybody?
3
MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
4 foundation, beyond the scope, calls for
5 speculation.
6 A. I haven't done research on why there were
7 these distinctions.
8 Q. Did you see a consistent distinction as far
9 as the percentages in the polls of smokers
10 believing versus the whole believing?
11
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
12 A. I would generally see that nonsmokers were
13 at higher levels than smokers, yes.
14 Q. When we were talking about the analogy of
15 the phone, you said, "Well, people may not
16 acknowledge they believe it, because they really
17 don't want to give up their phones." Do you
18 remember that?
19 A. I think I said something like that, yes.
20 Yes.
21 Q. Is that like a form of denial?
22
MR. COTTON: Object to form, beyond the
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 scope, calls for speculation.
0262
1 A. You know, again, I'm not a psychiatrist or
2 psychologist. It's a form of they're used to it,
3 they like it.
4 Q. Do you have any opinion as to whether or
5 not the addiction was playing a role -- from a
6 historian's perspective, not a psychiatrist or
7 psychologist. From a historian's perspective, do
8 you have any opinion as to whether or not the
9 10 percent difference is tied to this powerful
10 addiction?
11
MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
12 foundation, calls for speculation.
13 A. Again, I haven't done research on why there
14 was this particular -- this particular
15 distinction.
16 Q. Did you do research to determine why in
17 1969 only 60 percent of smokers and 70 percent of
18 everybody were convinced that lung cancer was one
19 of the causes -- smoking was one of the causes of
20 lung cancer?
21
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
22 A. Well, again, the information has been
23 coming out over the years, so that would account,
0263
1 you know, I think for a lot of the increasing
2 belief. But as to why there's a distinction
3 between smokers and nonsmokers, I didn't look at
4 that.
5 Q. I'm not asking about the distinction
6 anymore. Did you do any investigation or reach
7 any conclusions why 40 percent of the smokers as
8 late as 1969 still were not convinced that
9 cigarette smoking was one of the causes of lung
10 cancer?
11 A. No, I did not.
12 Q. Did you do any investigation to determine
13 why 30 percent of the public as a whole were not
14 convinced in 1969 that smoking was one of the
15 causes of lung cancer?
16 A. No. My focus was on the awareness issue.
17 Q. Moving forward to a poll in June of 1981,
18 again, a Gallup poll. "Do you think that
19 cigarette smoke is or is not one of the causes of
20 lung cancer?" We're now into 1981. What do you
21 think the number would be as late as 1981 for the
22 number of smokers who believed that smoking is
23 one of the causes of lung cancer?
0264
1
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
2 A. I don't recall. You know, I mean, I looked
3 at that poll, but I don't recall what the exact
4 percentage was.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 Q. Would you be surprised if it was only
6 69 percent that late, in 1981?
7
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
8 A. That's a pretty high percentage, I think.
9 Q. Really? 1981, thirty years after the
10 cancer scare and 31 percent of the smokers still
11 aren't convinced, you consider that a really high
12 number under the circumstances?
13
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
14 A. I do consider it a high number; but again,
15 I have not looked at that poll. I mean not
16 recently, anyway.
17 Q. And have you done anything to determine why
18 the 31 percent still aren't convinced?
19 A. No, I haven't looked at that issue.
20 Q. Would that be something you could have
21 looked at if you had been asked to do so? Could
22 you have done a historical assessment to try to
23 determine why there are still millions of people
0265
1 that aren't convinced?
2
MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
3 foundation.
4 A. Could I? I mean, that's not really my area
5 of research. I'm not a statistician, I'm not
6 somebody who is an expert in polls. I think you
7 might need somebody like that to really give more
8 of an informed opinion.
9 Q. Could you look at historical documents that
10 could talk about why a large segment of smokers
11 remain unconvinced, and look at the documents,
12 and summarize the documents as a historian and
13 come up with an opinion?
14 A. Well, there are plenty of things I could do
15 as a historian. I could look at polls, I could
16 look at documents, but I'm more interested in
17 what reached the public, what the public
18 awareness was. That's the focus of my research,
19 that's where I feel my research strength is, and
20 that's what I'm doing. It's a big job in and of
21 itself.
22 Q. Have you ever done any research projects
23 for academic reasons, not lawsuit reasons, where
0266
1 you researched things other than public
2 awareness?
3 A. Sure. Yes.
4 Q. For example, what?
5 A. Well, I did a biography more recently of a
6 civil rights leader.
7 Q. How about other than that? You told me
8 about that. What else have you done?
9 A. Oh, I did a book on tax, tax revolts during
10 the Great Depression. I did a book on fraternal
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 societies, mutual aid organizations. So those
12 are some of the areas. And I'm doing some work
13 now on the author, Zora Neale Hurston.
14 Q. So you certainly, as a historian, could
15 have looked into what were the cigarette
16 companies up to that may have influenced whether
17 or not smokers believed lung cancer was one --
18 smoking was one of the reasons for lung cancer?
19
MR. COTTON: Object to the form, lack of
20 foundation.
21 Q. You could have done it, right?
22 A. Well, to the extent -- I mean, I haven't
23 looked at polls that asked that question, and I
0267
1 don't see evidence of influence. People don't
2 take the industry as a source for health
3 information. I've looked at those polls, and
4 over and over again, it's the same thing. It's
5 not where they look for information.
6 Q. Why did you look at those polls? Why was
7 that relevant?
8 A. Why?
9 Q. Yes. Why was it relevant to you?
10 A. Because it indicates -- you know, it
11 indicates public -- public belief about a
12 particular issue.
13 Q. But what part of that public belief is
14 relevant to your assignment here?
15 A. Well, where are people getting their
16 sources of information, and that would certainly
17 relate to that; doctors, American Cancer Society,
18 family members. I mean, these are all
19 influential on the Whitney case, newspapers. So
20 where are they getting them; you know, what are
21 the sources. That would be relevant to that.
22 Q. So the relevance was to say whatever
23 information is out there from the cigarette
0268
1 companies, I don't believe that's having an
2 influence on people? Is that the relevance?
3 A. The influence is insignificant compared to
4 the poll asked about, you know, American Cancer
5 Society, I believe, and asked about -- it would
6 ask about a whole range of different sources;
7 educational institutions, et cetera. And it was
8 way down there, compared to these other sources
9 of information.
10 Q. In other words, as an influence for
11 people's belief, it was near irrelevant from that
12 poll?
13
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
14 A. Yes, close to it.
15 Q. And that's why you were looking at that
16 poll?
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 A. No, I mean, the poll --
18 Q. And the significance of what you were
19 doing?
20 A. No. The poll gave a very good picture of
21 what were the sources of information that people
22 looked to, what were the sources of information
23 they found credible.
0269
1 Q. And that they found influential?
2 A. Excuse me?
3 Q. And that they found influential?
4 A. Yes, on their behavior.
5 Q. On their behavior?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. So you were looking into information
8 influencing behavior. That was part of your
9 assignment, correct?
10 A. Well, influencing their -- you know, who
11 are the sources they look to for information?
12 Does that influence behavior? I mean, I would
13 say these are the people I find credible, you
14 know, that would probably follow; but I'm looking
15 more at what are the sources of information
16 they're getting and which ones do they find
17 credible.
18 Q. Right. But I'm using your words. You said
19 information that influenced behavior.
20 A. Well, I'm not so sure those were the proper
21 words for me to use. I think that there's a
22 certain logic that if you find a particular
23 source of health information to be credible,
0270
1 assuming you take action -- you may not take
2 action -- that would be more influential than
3 another source that you just don't find very
4 credible by comparison. But, again, I didn't
5 study, you know, how they acted on it. I studied
6 what they said and what their perception was as
7 to who was influential. Or the best source of
8 information, let's put it that way. Most
9 reliable source.
10 Q. So did you just decide because you saw a
11 poll that said very few people consider a
12 cigarette, a particular arm of the cigarette
13 industry, not to be a high source of reliability,
14 based on that poll you decided "I don't need to
15 look anymore into what cigarette companies were
16 doing that may be influential"?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
18 A. No. Certainly, I look at what cigarette
19 companies are saying to the public through
20 newspapers and through other sources. And I'm
21 certainly looking at advertising. So I'm looking
22 at those sources as well.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 Q. Why?
0271
1 A. Why? Because they're sources of
2 information.
3 Q. Well, why? What's the relevance?
4 A. Well, you don't -- you know, I don't go
5 forward with a preconception. I'm looking at
6 what are the sources of information there? It's
7 one source of information, certainly.
8 Q. Well, what is the relevance of what the
9 cigarette companies are saying to the public?
10 A. Very small relevance, but it's there.
11 Q. And what is that small relevance? Define
12 it.
13 A. What is it? Well, again, people, when
14 they're asked, who do you look to for information
15 about health, you're talking about what, two,
16 three percent, something like that. And then --
17 Q. You said, "I certainly looked at what they
18 were saying to the public" --
19 A. Right.
20 Q. -- and you said it has relevance, albeit
21 small. What is the relevance of you looking into
22 what the cigarette companies were saying to the
23 public?
0272
1 A. Very, very small. Very small.
2 Q. It's shrinking by the moment, I got that,
3 but there's got to be some (unintelligible).
4 What's your relevance?
5
MR. COTTON: Object to form, asked and
6 answered.
7 A. Again, very, very small.
8 Q. What is that, please?
9 A. And this is what people say in a poll, two
10 to three percent, that doesn't strike me as very
11 significant.
12 Q. Sir, my question is not whether it was
13 significant. My question is, what was the
14 relevance to your research?
15
MR. COTTON: Object to the form, asked and
16 answered.
17 A. I'm looking at the entire information
18 environment that's out there. And that would
19 include the content of news stories.
20 Q. And you did no assessment to see what, in
21 fact, information coming from the cigarette
22 industry side had on people's belief as to lung
23 cancer being caused by smoking; am I correct?
0273
1
MR. COTTON: Object to form,
2 mischaracterizes testimony.
3 A. I noted statements by the industry, I did
4 look at the polls to say, you know, to what
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 extent people find the industry to be credible
6 compared to these other sources as a source of
7 information about health, and found that they
8 found these other institutions and families and
9 doctors, friends, and other sources to be far
10 more credible.
11 Q. How many polls did you see that reached the
12 conclusion of who was more credible in these
13 different organizations?
14 A. Oh, two or three, I think, polls over the
15 years, that I've seen that asked that question.
16 It may have been more.
17 Q. So we have millions and millions and
18 millions of smokers who all the way out into the
19 '80s still don't believe smoking is one of the
20 causes of lung cancer, and we know that cigarette
21 companies were putting information out that would
22 indicate that link has not been established yet.
23 Do we know that?
0274
1
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
2 A. Yes. They are making -- that's one
3 argument they make.
4 Q. So we know they're making that argument,
5 and we know that into the '80s we've got millions
6 and millions and millions of smokers that don't
7 accept that smoking is one of the causes of lung
8 cancer. And the only reason that you have to
9 reject that what cigarette companies were saying
10 with that message is a significant reason so many
11 people still weren't convinced that were smokers,
12 is two or three polls that said cigarette
13 companies aren't much of a source for people to
14 trust?
15
MR. COTTON: Object to form.
16 Q. Right?
17
MR. COTTON: Object to form,
18 mischaracterizes testimony.
19 A. Well, I'm not sure how many polls were done
20 on that specific topic. I've seen a lot. But
21 that is one source. But certainly, the way
22 advertising is viewed in the media, advertisers
23 depict it. People tend to have kind of a "Don't
0275
1 go to advertisers," right? Don't go to, you
2 know, the cigarette industry and advertisers in
3 general to get information about health. They
4 look to other sources. They always take it with
5 a grain of salt. People are pretty savvy, I
6 think. Americans are pretty savvy about that.
7 Q. What, if anything, have you done to rule
8 out that the reason millions and millions of
9 people are still not convinced that smoking is
10 one of the causes of lung cancer, all the way out
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 into the 1980s, was the messaging being done by
12 the cigarette industry?
13
MR. COTTON: Object to the form, beyond the
14 scope.
15 A. Again, I'm focusing on public awareness.
16 I'm not looking at those issues. I'm looking at
17 what reached the public, what's the information
18 they reached it, and it is a vast amount of
19 information which is increasing rapidly over
20 time, and it is information that would have
21 reached Karen Whitney possibly through a lot of
22 different venues, such as newspapers and so
23 forth, and textbooks, and smoking cessation
0276
1 programs.
2 Q. Move to strike, and ask the court reporter
3 to please read back the question.
4
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
5 portion of the testimony was read back by the
6 court reporter.)
7
MR. COTTON: Object to form, beyond the
8 scope.
9 A. Beyond looking at polls and, you know,
10 looking at the media and how the industry is
11 treated and how advertisers are treated, you
12 know, I haven't made a systematic effort. I
13 mean, those are some of the things I've looked
14 at.
15 Q. What else have you looked at, other than
16 the two or three polls you've referred to and
17 this general belief that people don't go to
18 advertisers for their information, what else did
19 you do, if anything, to rule out that the
20 cigarette companies' messaging, that there was no
21 link between smoking and cancer that's been
22 established, was one of the reasons millions and
23 millions of smokers were still not convinced in
0277
1 the 1980s that smoking was one of the causes of
2 lung cancer?
3
MR. COTTON: Could you read that back,
4 please?
5
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
6 portion of the testimony was read back by the
7 court reporter.)
8
MR. COTTON: Object to form,
9 mischaracterizes the scope of the work Dr. Beito
10 did.
11 A. Again, it was more than just a general
12 belief. There were specific examples. One was
13 in the college -- or the high school newspaper
14 that Karen Whitney would possibly have been
15 exposed to, the Hialeah High School newspaper
16 that wrote a satirical article about, "Gee,
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 cigarette ads, why don't we see cigarette ads
18 with people with lung cancer, with people, you
19 know, with emaciated bodies," and so forth, "Why
20 don't we see ads like that?" See, that kind of
21 story about advertising and the credibility of
22 advertising and so forth, and about what the
23 truth is, I see stories like that a lot in
0278
1 different venues. So that's certainly something
2 that was part of the accumulated information that
3 I have.
4 Q. What else did you do other than look at the
5 two or three polls that you've referred to and
6 see information that people generally don't go to
7 advertisers as a credible source? What else --
8 A. And what --
9 Q. I'm sorry?
10 A. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
11 Q. What else, if anything, did you do to rule
12 out that the messaging cigarette companies --
13 A. Well, as I said --
14
MR. COTTON: Wait. There's not a question.
15
THE WITNESS: Oh, okay.
16 Q. Other than the two or three polls and that
17 people don't rely on advertisers for information,
18 what else, if anything, did you do to rule out
19 that the cigarette companies' message that there
20 was no link established between smoking and lung
21 cancer was an explanation for why millions and
22 millions of smokers into the '80s still were not
23 convinced that smoking was a cause of lung
0279
1 cancer?
2
MR. COTTON: Object to form,
3 mischaracterizes the scope of Dr. Beito's work.
4 A. Yes. And as I said, I've looked at how
5 advertisers are depicted, how the tobacco
6 companies are depicted in news stories that would
7 have reached the public, and satirical comments
8 and cartoons, all of that. So those would be
9 among the things I look at. But beyond that, you
10 know, nothing specific comes to mind beyond those
11 things I told you about.
12 Q. Have you seen any of the internal documents
13 that show where the cigarette company was
14 congratulating itself on how effective their
15 campaign to create the controversy was on
16 affecting public opinion as to whether or not
17 their products cause lung cancer?
18
MR. COTTON: Object to form, lack of
19 foundation.
20 A. No. Again, I did not do research on the
21 internal company documents, other than the
22 examples I gave you earlier about polls and
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 transcripts of radio and television shows.

1 Q. Did you see any internal documents where
2 the company was -- in other words, you've seen no
3 internal documents? Nothing other than polls?
4
MR. COTTON: Object to form,
5 mischaracterizes prior testimony.
6 A. I did not do research on internal
7 documents.
8 Q. That's different than having not seen them.
9 A. I saw one, I didn't read it closely.
10 Q. What did you see?
11 A. When did I see it?
12 Q. What did you see?
13 A. I don't remember. I didn't read it
14 closely. I may have glanced at an internal
15 document or something from the Legacy side, I
16 don't know, but that wasn't my research. And
17 when I do research, my research is focused. And
18 this is an example of that. When I do research
19 on civil rights and Senator Bilbo in Mississippi,
20 I look at part of the collection that relates to
21 that. That's what my focus is.
22 Q. Is one of the places you saw the document
23 in any of those training sessions with the
0281
1 lawyer?
2
MR. COTTON: Object to form,
3 mischaracterizes prior testimony.
4 A. No. And I wouldn't call those training
5 sessions. They were more give me a sense of what
6 I faced in terms of depositions. But I did not
7 see any internal documents.
8 Q. When you were on, what's the name of the
9 site again, Legacy?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. When you were on Legacy and you came across
12 an internal document, did you immediately flip
13 away as opposed to being curious and looking at
14 it?
15
MR. COTTON: Object to the form.
16 A. I would look at key words such as "poll,"
17 "transcript." And if it wasn't a poll or a
18 transcript, I would move on to something else,
19 because that was what I was looking for, and
20 that's what I would do in any historical
21 research.
22 Q. But you told me you saw one internal
23 document, but you didn't really read it. Was
0282
1 that on Legacy?
2 A. Yes. If I saw anything, it might have been
3 on Legacy.
4 Q. My question is, when you saw it on Legacy
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 and you said you didn't read the whole thing, did
6 you intentionally stop, as opposed to being
7 curious and finish?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection to form.
9 A. I don't know what my motivation was, but my
10 motivation was -- and there's plenty on that
11 site -- to find information about poll data and
12 to find information about transcripts. And I
13 would do that if I were researching Senator
14 Bilbo. I would say, "Oh, there's nothing here
15 about civil rights. Let me look at something
16 else."
17 Q. My question is, you remember specifically
18 that you saw one document. Why didn't you finish
19 reading it?
20 A. Because the scope of my research was to
21 look at public awareness and what reached the
22 public, and that would include, you know,
23 information about polls, which we get a sense of
0283
1 awareness and belief levels. But transcript
2 would relate to something that reached the public
3 of a show that may no longer exist in any other
4 form, other than a transcript.
5 Q. How did you know that this was a document
6 that was an internal document to be able to tell
7 me, "Yes, I saw one"? How much did you read to
8 know it?
9 A. You know, in some sense I guess a -- I
10 don't know if a transcript would be considered an
11 internal document or not, but it's quite clear
12 once you see the document, "Oh, this is a
13 transcript" or "This is a poll." They're
14 formatted quite clearly, and so I focus on those.
15 Q. My question is, of all the millions of
16 documents, or however many there are on there,
17 there are internal documents that are not polls
18 or transcripts. How is it that you recall
19 stumbling across just one?
20 A. I don't know if it was just one. You know,
21 I would do a Google search, look up key words,
22 "transcript" or "poll," right, and go down the
23 list. Okay, "Oh, that's not a transcript";
0284
1 "That's not a poll. Let's go to the next one,"
2 you know, et cetera. Let's find a transcript,
3 let's find a poll. It's a big job. As you said,
4 there are millions of documents, and I want to be
5 productive with my time, and I want to find that
6 information.
7 Q. You are aware from your source materials
8 you looked at initially, that there is a body of
9 documents out there that, at least according to
10 your source references, establish a conspiracy to
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]11 intentionally create a controversy. You're aware
12 of that, are you not?
13
MR. COTTON: Objection, form, lack of
14 foundation, beyond the scope, calls for
15 speculation.
16 A. I've seen secondary work, but I haven't
17 done research in that area. And I've done
18 research in this area, and this is where my -- I
19 guess my expertise, if anything, is, looking at
20 the issues of public awareness. That's what I
21 focused on, what reached the public; and in this
22 case, specifically what were some of the sources
23 that Karen Whitney might have been exposed to.
0285
1 Q. Going back, my question, though, is, when
2 you read those source materials, you read the
3 part that talked about the conspiracy and the
4 efforts to create a controversy to affect
5 people's belief or not that smoking caused lung
6 cancer. You saw that in the source material, did
7 you not?
8
MR. COTTON: Objection, form, lack of
9 foundation, beyond the scope, calls for
10 speculation.
11 A. As a historian, I've seen all sorts of
12 stuff about all sorts of historical subjects.
13 But if I haven't done hands-on research, you
14 know, I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert on
15 those particular topics.
16 Q. I didn't ask you if you were an expert.
17 What I'm asking, is that part of what you read in
18 the source material?
19
MR. COTTON: He just said that that's
20 beyond the scope of what he did.
21 Q. I didn't ask for the scope of what you did.
22 I'm asking, did you read it when you read the
23 source material?
0286
1
MR. COTTON: Objection to form, lack of
2 foundation, beyond the scope of what Dr. Beito
3 did, calls for speculation.
4 A. I saw references to it, but my focus in
5 that research was awareness issues. And I didn't
6 do the kind of detailed investigation that I've
7 done on this kind of project, all right? So,
8 sure, you see a passing reference here and there
9 to all kinds of historical topics, but that's not
10 the focus of my research.
11
MR. COTTON: And there, are you talking
12 about references in secondary sources?
13
THE WITNESS: Yes, secondary sources. Yes.
14
MR. COTTON: Like a standard Facebook and
15 the Kluger book?
16
THE WITNESS: That's right, Kluger. That
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]17 would be the main one.
18 Q. Are you attempting to render an opinion as
19 to what Karen Whitney believed as to the
20 addictive nature of cigarettes when she started?
21 A. What I have to go on with Karen Whitney is
22 depositions. So to the extent, you know, that
23 those depositions bear on that, I would --
0287
1 certainly, you know, that would be a source of
2 evidence. Certainly, that would be a source of
3 evidence.
4 Q. Move to strike, and ask the court reporter
5 to read back the question.
6
(Whereupon, at this time the designated
7 portion of the testimony was read back by the
8 court reporter.)
9 A. I know what Karen Whitney said, I know what
10 others said and, you know, I can't read people's
11 thoughts. I can't put people on the lie detector
12 and say, "Do you believe this" or "Don't you
13 believe that?" But I certainly have source
14 material about perception and what people say
15 they think. And that could come from the
16 depositions, and that would be the source for
17 that.
18 Q. With that, I'm going to suspend the
19 deposition.
20
MR. COTTON: Before we do that, though, I'm
21 going to ask a couple of quick questions.
22
MR. MITNIK: Go ahead.
23
0288
1 EXAMINATION BY MR. COTTON:
2 Q. Doctor, are you okay to continue for a few
3 more minutes?
4 A. Sure.
5 Q. So, Doctor, over the course of the day
6 today, I've heard you allude to some examples of
7 information sources that you saw tied to Ms.
8 Whitney; do you recall?
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And I think at one point you spoke about
11 warnings. Do you recall that?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. In your review of materials in this case,
14 did you see testimony that Mrs. Whitney saw the
15 health warnings that appeared on cigarette
16 packages in 1966?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And did you see testimony that she recalled
19 the warnings changing to read "Warning: The
20 surgeon general has determined that cigarette
21 smoking is dangerous to your health"?
22 A. Yes, I recall reading that.
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]23 Q. And have you seen testimony in review of
0289
1 this case that she saw the rotating warnings that
2 began to appear on cigarette packages in 1985?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. And I think at one point Mr. Mitnik asked
5 you some questions about songs. Do you recall
6 that?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. Did you see testimony that Mrs. Whitney is
9 familiar with the song, Smoke Smoke Smoke that
10 Cigarette by Tex Williams?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Do you recall seeing testimony by Mrs.
13 Whitney where she acknowledged it's possible she
14 heard messages from the American Lung Association
15 about people needing to quit smoking?
16 A. Yes, I do recall that. I think maybe the
17 American Cancer Society as well.
18 Q. So to be clear, you also recall testimony
19 by Mrs. Whitney that she recalled possibly seeing
20 messages from the American Cancer Society that
21 people should quit smoking?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And do you recall testimony by Mrs. Whitney
0290
1 where she acknowledged it's possible she heard
2 messages from the American Heart Association
3 about people needing to quit smoking?
4 A. Yes, I do recall that.
5 Q. And do you recall testimony by Mrs. Whitney
6 about seeing public service announcements?
7 A. I'll have to think about that. I vaguely
8 remember that, yes.
9 Q. Now, in addition to the topics that you
10 mentioned earlier in response to questions by Mr.
11 Mitnik, are all of these things that you may
12 decide to testify about at trial in this case?
13 A. Yes.
14
MR. COTTON: Thank you, Doctor. Do you
15 have any other questions right now, Mr. Mitnik?
16
MR. MITNIK: No, we'll suspend the depo.
17
MR. COTTON: For the record, we will object
18 to continuing this deposition. Dr. Beito is
19 here, available, and prepared to continue to
20 answer questions. I understand that you may
21 disagree with that position; but as far as we're
22 concerned, this deposition is concluded. Dr.
23 Beito will reserve the right to read and sign the
0291
1 transcript.
2
MR. MITNIK: For the record, I do not
3 believe an attorney in the deposition needs to
4 reask, reask, reask, reask the same questions and
2013.05.02 Deposition David Beito, PhD WHITNEY.txt[18/04/2016 13:53:13]5 have answers tempered with self-serving things
6 for one side, and struggle so much to get simple
7 straightforward answers from a highly intelligent
8 witness; and, therefore, I will be seeking not
9 only to continue the deposition but appropriate
10 sanctions.
11
MR. COTTON: Well, we understand that
12 that's your position, and we reserve all of our
13 rights, including our right to oppose any such --
14
MR. MITNIK: I will allow the transcript to
15 speak for itself, and we'll let the judge decide.
16
MR. COTTON: Very good.
17
MR. MITNIK: Y'all have a good day.
18
(Whereupon, at this time the
19 deposition was concluded at 4:30 p.m.)
