15 having been first duly sworn, was

EXAMINATION
BY MS. CASE:
Q.
You understand we're going to talk
about the Evers case?
21 A. That's correct.
22 Q. You understand that Cindy Evers is
23 acting as personal representative for her
24 late mother, Jacqueline Loyd?
25
A.
That's correct.
6
1
Q.
I think it's probably safe to say we
2 can skip the usual instructions on how
3 depositions work.
4 fair?
Would you say that's
You agree to that?
5 A. That's reasonable and appropriate.
6 Q. And we just did sit through a couple
7 of hours of questioning of you on the Willis
8 case, and I believe that the understanding
9 is -- and Hank can correct me if I'm wrong
10 -- that all those questions and answers are
11 acceptable for use in the Evers case to save
12 time.
13 we discussed this morning?
Was that your understanding of what
Page 514
15
A.
Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
That's fair.
Yes.
MS. CASE:
16
Hank, give us some indication if
17 that's not your understanding.
18 MR. UITERWYK:
19
You want to go off the record?
20 We'll talk about it.
21 MS. CASE:
22
Sure.
23
24
25
(Off the record.)
MS. CASE:
Q.
Apparently, we cannot reach an
7
1 agreement on the record, but we'll let your
2 answer about what we discussed stand to the
3 extent that at a later time, it becomes
4 clear that we're going to have a problem
5 using those questions and answers, I'll
6 just --
7 MR. UITERWYK:
8
9
You can use those questions and
answers from the other deposition.
10 have any problem with that.
11 MS. CASE:
12
Didn't you just say you wouldn't say
13 that?
14 MR. UITERWYK:
15
16
I don't
No, no, no.
question.
I misunderstood your
I don't have any problem with you
Page 617 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
using those questions. I think you can,
18 anyway, under the rules.
19 purposes, you can always use those, to the
20 extent they're generic rather than
21 case-specific.
22 MS. CASE:
23
That's all I wanted to know.
24
25
For impeachment
(Off the record.)
MS. CASE:
8
1
Q.
And just as you testified in
2 relation to the Willis case, would you say
3 that your opinions that you would intend to
4 give at trial in the Evers case are the same
5 general opinions you gave in your generic
6 deposition in January and in the Hess and
7 Sherman cases?
8 A. Yes.
That's fair.
That's true.
9 Q. It's my understanding today is the
10 only chance I have to ask you about your
11 opinions.
12 testimony on them today?
13
A.
Are you prepared to give
Somewhat.
I have to say that, you
14 know, since we've combined two cases
15 together, and this has been a busy time for
16 me at the beginning of the semester, I
17 haven't completely reviewed -- only the two
18 depositions which I have, one by Cindy Evers
19 and the other by Ms. Loyd's husband, you
Page 720 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
know, completely. So I'm going to be a
21 little weak on that.
22 that, but it's just a function of getting
23 buried in a lot of other responsibilities at
24 this point in time.
25 a general observation, that the -- that
And I'm sorry about
And I will say, just as
9
1 documentary record is pretty thin compared,
2 say, for example, to the earlier discussion
3 about Willis.
4
Q.
So the only materials that you've
5 looked at in relation to the Evers case
6 specifically are the deposition of Cindy
7 Evers, Mrs. Loyd's daughter, and the
8 deposition of Ellis Loyd, Mrs. Loyd's
9 husband?
10
A.
That's correct.
And I have received
11 those by e-mail attachment in electronic
12 form.
13
Q.
And do you have any plans to do
14 additional research, review additional
15 depositions with relation to the Evers case?
16
A.
Right now, I don't -- no.
I don't
17 have plans to do any additional research.
18 asked the attorney, who is not Mr. Uiterwyk,
19 was a gentleman by the name of Brent Bigger,
20 to send me the relevant plaintiffs
21 depositions that I would need to answer the
22 questions that I always ask, which I've
Page 8
I23 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
discussed in Willis, which is situating the
24 -- in this case, the decedent in place and
25 time, and that's what he sent me.
So it's
10
1 -- if other materials exist, I'm not aware
2 of them.
3 all they had to really go on.
4
Q.
But that was represented to me as
You didn't ask Mr. Bigger if
5 additional deposition testimony was
6 available for your review?
7
A.
Well, I asked him to send me what
8 was available, and then I got that, and then
9 I didn't follow up.
You know, I just asked
10 them once, figured I only had to ask them
11 once for the relevant testimony and not have
12 to go back and ask them again.
13
Q.
This may seem like a fine point, but
14 did you ask him for all of the available
15 materials relating to the Evers case?
16
A.
Not all because, I mean, there are
17 many materials that are not relevant to my
18 opinions, medical testimony and things like
19 that.
20 were -- would shed light on Ms. Loyd's
21 biography, in essence.
22 that term, but that's what my intention was,
23 you know, her life, so that I can establish,
24 you know, the same thing I always try to
25 establish, just generally to place her in
I asked for those depositions that
I don't think I used
Page 9Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
11
1 time and space, as a person, just to situate
2 her.
3
Q.
So you relied on Mr. Bigger's
4 judgment to determine what materials you
5 would use to do that?
6 MR. UITERWYK:
7
8
9
Objection, form.
A.
For plaintiffs' testimony because I
don't know what testimony has been gathered
10 in any particular law case.
11 that has done that or his firm and his
12 assistants or whomever who have actually
13 done it and been present during depositions.
14 And so for that, yes, I do rely on the
15 attorney because they do know about that,
16 they should know about that.
17
Q.
He is the one
And you said you didn't do any
18 follow-up with relation to what else may be
19 available; is that true?
20
A.
That's correct.
I just sent those
21 materials in an e-mail and considered that
22 my request had been satisfied the first time
23 I asked it.
24
25
Q.
Do you know if any testimony in this
case, the Evers case, is available on video?
12
Page 10Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
1 A. I just have transcripts.
2 Q. Would you be interested if the
3
testimony was available on video?
4
A.
I think the transcripts are
5 sufficient, you know, focusing on what
6 people actually said.
7 that's suitable.
8 before.
9 videotape depositions.
For my purposes,
I've never looked at video
I know it's not uncommon to
Mine have been
10 videotaped, as well, but I never ask for a
11 video copy.
12 The transcript is sufficient.
13
Q.
I usually get the transcript.
And I'm assuming you haven't spoken
14 to or interviewed Mrs. Evers or anyone who
15 knew Mrs. Loyd?
16 A. No.
I've not done that.
17 Q. How many hours would you say you've
18 spent working on the Evers case,
19 particularly the Evers case?
20
21
A.
In reviewing the depositions very
briefly, probably one hour.
22
Q.
Not much.
And how much have you charged Mr.
23 Uiterwyk's firm for your hour of time spent
24 on the Evers case?
25
A.
I haven't billed them for anything
13
1
2
3
yet.
Q.
How much do you plan to charge them
for the hour of time spent on the Evers
Page 11Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
4
case?
5 A. Well, my rate is $400 an hour.
6 Q. When did you first receive the
7
8
9
depositions of Mrs. Evers and Mr. Loyd?
A.
I received them by e-mail
attachment, so I could check the e-mail and
10 give you the precise, but my recollection is
11 it's within the last -- I think around
12 sometime after the 4th of July.
13
14
15
Q.
And is that the first time you had
heard about the Evers case?
A.
I had spoken with Mr. Bigger in
16 June, where he told me -- he called, and he
17 would actually be the first -- I think he
18 might have been the first Uiterwyk-attached
19 lawyer, from the Uiterwyk law firm that I
20 had actually made contact with, and
21 explained to me that they had some cases
22 coming up, of which one was this Evers case.
23
Q.
Can you tell me more specifically
24 when in June you spoke with Mr. Bigger about
25 working on behalf of the Uiterwyk firm?
14
1
A.
Well, on these set of cases, it
2 would have been probably sometime around the
3 middle of June.
4
5
6
Q.
And can you tell me what cases you
discussed at that time?
A.
He mentioned the Evers case, just
Page 12Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
7 mentioning it, the Willis case and I don't
8 know what others.
9 mentioned any others.
10
I don't think he
You know, they may have listed me on
11 cases that are in the works, but until
12 there's, you know, depositions scheduled, it
13 doesn't really -- it doesn't really exist,
14 from my perspective, even though for you, of
15 course, it does very much exist.
16 a very different, you know, perception of
17 these things and I handle them in a
18 different way because I have such a thin
19 little piece of the larger puzzle.
20
Q.
So I have
And I think I've seen you testify
21 before that you don't have a problem with
22 lawyers for plaintiffs listing you as an
23 expert if they expect that the testimony in
24 your -- the testimony you've given in the
25 past about your opinions would be helpful to
15
1 that case.
2 them listing you?
3
4
5
A.
You don't have a problem with
That's correct.
Yeah.
I don't
charge a listing fee or anything like that.
Q.
Now, I want to talk specifically
6 about what you and Mr. Bigger discussed
7 about the Evers case in that first
8 conversation in June.
9 what the two of you discussed?
Page 13
Could you tell meKyriakoudes 08-19-2009
10
A.
Yes.
I can tell you, he said they
11 had this Evers case coming up, could you
12 supply me with some dates for a deposition.
13 I said, I'll get back to you.
14 And then after that, I dealt with a
15 secretary in their office and established --
16 was this the one that was originally
17 scheduled for this date or another one?
18 forget, but this one got combined, but
19 somehow we got to this date.
20
I
As you well know, I've got a lot
21 going on and I don't keep it all straight.
22 I just -- when I have a firm date, I write
23 it down in my day planner, and then it's
24 real, and before that, it's -- it's not
25 worth my time to keep up with it.
16
1
2
3
(Off the record.)
MS. CASE:
Q.
Before we went off, we were talking
4 about when your date may have originally
5 been scheduled, and to clear that up, I
6 think originally you were scheduled to be
7 deposed in this case on August 5th, but you
8 wound up testifying in the Campbell trial on
9 that day.
10
11
12
Is that consistent with your
recollection?
A.
pushed.
Okay. This is the one that got
Yeah. That sounds right.
Page 14Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
13
Q.
Other than the conversation you had
14 with Mr. Bigger in mid June about the Evers
15 case, have you spoken with him since then?
16
A.
No, I haven't.
Well, no, that's not
17 true.
18 Campbell case to work out scheduling, and
19 that was the content of that, of the
20 conversation.
21
Q.
I called him after I testified in the
And I may not have asked this.
In
22 that first conversation with Mr. Bigger, you
23 said he asked for dates.
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. And there was nothing beyond that
17
1 that you discussed regarding the Evers case
2 in that first conversation?
3 A. That's correct.
4 Q. And how about when you called Mr.
5 Bigger after your Campbell testimony to
6 discuss dates, was there anything beyond
7 dates that you discussed at that time with
8 him?
9 A. Nothing.
10 Q. Other than those two communications
11 with Mr. Bigger, have you spoken to him
12 other than that?
13 A. No.
14 Q. Other than those two communications
15
That's it.
with Mr. Bigger, have you spoken with anyone
Page 15Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
16 at the Uiterwyk law firm, aside from the one
17 paralegal communication that you mentioned?
18 A. About the Evers case?
19 Q. Yes.
20 A. No.
21
22
That's it.
No one else and
nothing else.
Q.
So has anyone at the Uiterwyk law
23 firm provided you with any summary of what
24 issues are relevant to this Evers case?
25
A.
No.
I have just those two
18
1
2
depositions that we mentioned earlier.
Q.
And those two depositions represent
3 the entire universe of information that you
4 have about the Evers case?
5
A.
They do.
6
7
(Exhibit 1 was marked.)
MS. CASE:
8
9
10
11
12
I have marked your deposition notice
as Exhibit 1.
Q.
Referring your attention to Exhibit
1, professor, have you seen this document?
A.
I don't know if I've seen this one.
13 I think I only saw the notice for the Willis
14 case, and I don't think you guys sent me
15 this one, but I think as long as I knew how
16 to show up.
17
18
Q.
And you've seen documents similar to
this before?
Page 16Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
19
A.
Yes.
And it looks like the Schedule
20 A is similar, if not identical, to the other
21 one.
22
Q.
And just for the record, what I've
23 handed you marked as Exhibit 1 is
24 Defendant's Amended Notice of Taking
25 Deposition Duces Tecum.
19
1 A. That's right.
2 Q. Well, first, let me ask you this:
3 Have you brought with you today any
4 materials responsive to Schedule A of
5 Exhibit 1?
6 at least read through the categories before
7 you answer that definitively.
8
9
A.
And I suppose I should let you
I haven't, except for what I -- I
can give you another copy of my CV.
I gave
10 one to the other guy this morning, but you
11 are entitled to one, as well.
12
Q.
And I believe your CV is marked
13 Exhibit 6 to the Willis deposition.
14 trust your CV has not changed from this
15 morning when you handed it to Mr. Boyd?
16 A.
17 list of --
18 MR. UITERWYK:
I have to add a deposition to my
19
20
21
And I
He's right.
MS. CASE:
Q.
With the exception of the Willis
Page 17Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
22 deposition you gave this morning, is your CV
23 any different than the one you handed Mr.
24 Boyd?
25
A.
No.
It is identical.
20
1
MS. CASE:
2 Then I think, for purposes of this
3 deposition, we can refer folks to Exhibit 6
4 to the Willis deposition taken this morning.
5 MR. UITERWYK:
6
7
8
9
10
No objection.
MS. CASE:
Q.
Can you take a look through the
categories listed, 1 through 16?
A.
Yes.
I mean, I don't have anything
11 else.
12 internal documents in the reliance, which is
13 Item Number 14.
14 with Ms. Evers or any other of the people
15 directly involved in the case.
16 described to you the communication I've had
17 with Mr. Biggers and that's the total of the
18 discussions on this particular case.
19 prepared no special documents or special
20 reports and have no special notes or things
21 created for this particular case.
22
Q.
You know, I've given you all the
I have no communications
I've
I've
And you had mentioned the e-mail
23 that Mr. Biggers sent you, including those
24 two deposition transcripts that we
Page 18Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
25
discussed.
You did not bring a copy of that
21
1
2
e-mail with you today; is that right?
A.
Yes.
I don't know that he -- you
3 know, I talked to him on the phone.
4 the e-mail was from his secretary.
5 that stuff has come from Diane Carter.
6 that a secretary in your office?
7 that's the name of -- or Diane something.
8
9
Q.
I think
All of
Is
I believe
And would you agree that an e-mail
from Mr. Bigger's secretary would fall
10 within Number 15 on Schedule A of Exhibit 1,
11 as an e-mail from someone acting on behalf
12 of plaintiff's counsel?
13
A.
Okay.
14 shortly.
15 MR. UITERWYK:
16
And I can get you that very
As you know, we're taking the
17 position that e-mails are work product.
18 scheduling e-mails, I don't think they are
19 work product.
20
21
A.
MS. CASE:
22 Q.
23 today?
24 A.
25
I can find that for you.
But
You can bring me a copy of that
Yes, in a moment, when we take a
rest room break.
Page 19Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
22
1
Q.
When we do take a break, you can
2 print that, and I suppose you can show it to
3 Mr. Uiterwyk, and if he has no objection, I
4 would ask that we mark that as part of the
5 deposition.
6 Any other e-mails that you've
7 received from anyone in Mr. Uiterwyk's
8 office, albeit a lawyer, legal assistant,
9 secretary, other than the one that we've
10
11
12
13
already discussed?
A.
I don't think so.
But, you know,
I'll double-check and print that out.
Q.
Okay.
I would appreciate that.
14 you said you haven't looked at any medical
15 records?
And
16 A. No.
17 Q. You have not undertaken any travel
18
19
I have no travel documents.
as part of your research for this case?
A.
No.
Item 13, I addressed in the
20 Willis deposition.
21 have those materials.
22
Q.
You know, those -- you
So other than things you've already
23 produced in your reliance materials, you
24 have nothing else responsive to Schedule A?
25
A.
That's right.

Q.
Can you tell me how -- what I
Page 202 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
received -- what I received, in terms of
3 your reliance materials, were two CDs.
4 you create those CDs?
5
A.
I did.
Did
I sent -- I sent the
6 Uiterwyk law firm just a directory of
7 documents that I keep on my computer and I
8 just brought -- they should be DVDs,
9 actually.
It's more than will fit on a CD.
10 And -- 11 Q. Two disks, let's call them --
12 A. Two disks, but it's a large amount
13 of material.
And I sent them, burnt those
14 to the disk.
And just so that we're clear,
15 if you can recall, things are organized like
16 your ATCO, American Tobacco, and newspaper.
17 I have some specific papers, a whole New
18 York times folder, a series of folders,
19 computer folders, and then the documents are
20 organized that way.
21
Q.
That does sound familiar to me.
22 mainly was getting at whether you had sent
23 them in hard copy to the Uiterwyk firm or
24 sent them electronically.
I
25
A.
No.
24
1
2
Q.
So what I'm hearing you say is you
sent them two disks?
3 A. That's correct.
4 Q. And as far as you know, the two
Page 215 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
disks that you sent them, the material on
6 them is the same two disks that I would have
7 received as your reliance materials?
8 A. That's correct, yes.
9 Q. Is there anything different about
10 the -- or you wouldn't expect there to be
11 anything different about the two disks that
12 Mr. Boyd received for the Willis case versus
13 the two disks that I received for the Evers
14 case?
15
16
17
A.
They should be identical and the
same.
Q.
So there are no materials that are
18 on your reliance list that you would say are
19 specific to the Evers case; is that fair?
20 A. That's fair and true.
21 Q. You produced a reliance list for
22 your generic trial preservation deposition
23 in January of this year.
24 that?
25
A.
Do you recall
That's correct.
25
1
Q.
Can you tell me how your reliance
2 list for that deposition in January is
3 different than the two disks that you
4 produced to the Uiterwyk firm with your
5 reliance materials for the Evers case?
6
7
A.
Yes.
I don't believe that the
reliance list in January had all of the
Page 228 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
newspapers and educational textbooks,
9 government documents, Surgeon General's
10 reports and those items on there.
11 much more material.
12 the list for the generic had all the videos
13 and advertisements, you know, that I've
14 collected over the years in my research.
15
There's
I don't believe that
And we were talking earlier about as
16 a list, you know, in the best of all worlds,
17 I would have a list, and I'm trying to get
18 to that point because it's a huge amount of
19 information.
20 that the reliance materials that I sent on
21 the disk is a larger universe of materials,
22 and what was done at the deposition,
23 preservation deposition was a smaller amount
24 of material.
25
Q.
But I think you will agree
And I received the --
26
1
2
3
A.
Subset.
I should say subset of
material.
Q.
I received the two disks in July.
4 Is that around the time that you sent them
5 to Mr. Uiterwyk's firm?
6 A.
7 right.
8 Q.
9
10
Yeah.
That's -- yes.
That sounds
So if I refer to your July reliance
list versus your January reliance list, you
will understand what I'm talking about?
Page 23Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. So what I'm hearing you say, when
13 you are telling me that there were
14 government documents and Surgeon General's
15 reports and things that weren't on your
16 January reliance list that are on your July
17 reliance list, that doesn't represent
18 research that you've conducted since
19 January, does it?
20
A.
No.
No.
That's a good question.
21 No.
It simply reflects, you know -- putting
22 together the material.
23 those two disks -- and this is exactly -- I
24 right click, and send it either to the
25 stick, or in this case, or I burn the disks.
What you have on
27
1 I just simply move the files to the CD
2 burner and what you have is what is on my
3 computer.
4 There's no alternative set of documents or
5 anything.
6
I mean, there's no difference.
There should be the 1980 Surgeon
7 General's Report on that list.
I hope so.
8 Some things, I -- I don't have to save
9 everything locally because it's getting to
10 be a lot of material and that hard drive is
11 starting to get clogged.
12
13
Q.
So would you agree that what we had
in January, in terms of your reliance list,
Page 2414 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
was not the entire universe of documents on
15 which -- that you had reviewed and on which
16 you based your opinions as of that time?
17
A.
Oh, in January?
Well, they put
18 together an exhibit list.
Let me make sure
19 I'm talking about the right thing.
20 went to the deposition, for the preservation
21 deposition, I did the same thing I did for
22 you, which was, at that time, whatever I
23 have on my CD, on my hard drive, I gave, I
24 believe it was Mr. Garrity and Mr. Coathe
25 were there, and I gave all that I had then.
When I
28
1
But they put together a list of
2 exhibits, a more -- of trial exhibits for
3 the preservation deposition.
4 smaller list of materials.
5 was documents.
6 document-based direct examination.
7 know, so it's -- I did supply everything
8 that I had at the time to you guys, but, you
9 know, when they actually typed it up into a
That's a
And most of that
That was a very heavy
10 list, that was a smaller subset of
11 materials.
12 Q.
You
Let's clear this up because I think
13 we may be slightly confused.
You've talked
14 about reliance materials from January versus
15 an exhibit list from January.
16 different things.
Those are two
Page 2517
A.
Okay.
No.
Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
Maybe I'm getting this
18 confused.
At first, the reliance
19 materials, at each point that I've been
20 asked to surrender -- not surrender, but to
21 give those to you, to supply those and
22 share, share those with you, because you all
23 share with me, which I appreciate.
24 defense exhibits are interesting and good.
25 I've given you what I had.
Those
29
1
And here's some new things that I've
2 added over the course of the spring.
This
3 is what you are really asking.
4 more research in Chicago newspapers, some
5 more research in Connecticut newspapers,
6 things like that.
7 reviewed some of the Surgeon General's
8 reports.
9 I've looked at at least a part of all of
I did some
I've gone back and
You know, there's 26 of them.
And
10 them, but I've gone back and kind of
11 reacquainted myself, the 1980 one, for
12 example, on women and smoking, which would
13 be relevant to this case, more
14 advertisements.
15
I'm relying very heavily now on the
16 Not a Cough in a Carload web site because
17 while I've seen all those advertisements in
18 my research, it is burdensome to copy them,
19 and their scans are of such high quality,
Page 2620
Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
it's just a convenience.
21
Additional television commercials,
22 things like that, which are relatively
23 available and don't require much time to
24 research.
25 what's out there.
It's one thing to be aware of
It's another thing to
30
1 kind of formally incorporate it into the
2 materials.
3
4
5
6
7
Other things that have been added
since that time --
Q.
"That time" meaning January of this
year?
A.
In January.
That would be the
8 thrust of it, you know, more advertisements,
9 the Not a Cough in a Carload timeline museum
10 web site has been just a convenience.
11 ADSGR, just reacquainting that.
12 familiar with it, but just kind of putting
13 that back in the top shelf review.
14 additional newspaper research, which, you
15 know, I do when I can, when I can do.
16
Q.
I'm
And
So it's fair to say, based on what
17 you told us earlier about your testimony
18 being consistent with what you provided in
19 Hess, Sherman and your generic deposition,
20 that any of this new research that you've
21 conducted over the spring hasn't changed
22 your opinions?
Page 27Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
23
MR. UITERWYK:
24
25
Objection to form.
MS. CASE:
31
1 Q. Generally?
2 A. That's correct and fair.
3 Q. Other than Chicago newspapers and
4 Connecticut newspapers, have you done any
5 other additional newspaper research over the
6 spring?
7
A.
If you look in there, there's --
8 I've had some access to some electronic
9 versions of obscure Florida papers.
10
11
12
Q.
What do you mean by "obscure Florida
papers"?
A.
Fort Walton, Panama City papers.
13 And I've added a few stories in there.
14 I've accessed those through a web site
15 archive called Newspaperarchive.Com, which
16 is something I've been using lately.
17
Q.
So would you say you've conducted a
18 comprehensive review of the Fort Walton
19 newspaper?
20 A.
21
22
23
24
25
And
For the 1950s, just for a limited
period of time.
Q.
And what do you mean -- what do you
understand "comprehensive" to mean?
A.
In this case, it's an electronic
interface, so I'm using a keyword searching
Page 28Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
32
1 for cigarette, tobacco, cancer, critical
2 words like that, which would -- that are the
3 broadest keyword identifiers to pull up
4 representative stories on smoking and
5 health, and also some advertisements.
6
7
8
9
10
Q.
You didn't do that research for the
Evers case, correct?
A.
No.
No.
You've just been asking me
about what's been going on in the spring.
Q.
And it's not your understanding that
11 Mrs. Loyd ever lived in Fort Walton,
12 correct?
13 A. That's correct.
14 Q. Would the same be true for the
15
Panama City papers?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Any other newspapers beyond Chicago,
18 Connecticut, Fort Walton and Panama City
19 that you've looked at?
20 I suppose we can define, if it's okay with
21 you, to say since your deposition in January
22 of 2009.
And over the spring,
Is that fair?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. So the last six months would
25
That's fair.
probably be more accurate.
33
Page 29Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
1
2
3
A. Yes, six months.
That's it.
That's
Q. Any additional research that, as you
it.
4 sit here today, you can tell me that you
5 plan to do?
6
A.
The only additional research for
7 this case right now that I plan to do is to
8 review the plaintiff's depositions again,
9 the ones that I mentioned.
10 dodgey on those right now.
I am a little
11 Q. What do you mean by "dodgey"?
12 A. Or dodgey, I'm a little -- I haven't
13 given them the full amount of time that they
14 deserve, and that's simply because I was --
15 I've been a little bit -- I've had a large
16 amount of work in the last few weeks that's
17 made scheduling difficult.
18
Q.
And I imagine, to the extent that
19 your dodginess with relation to the
20 transcripts that you've been provided, to
21 the extent that that hampers your ability to
22 answer my questions here today, you wouldn't
23 have an objection to returning once you've
24 given them the time you think they deserve;
25 is that right?
34
1
A.
That's fair.
And I'm happy to make
2 myself available so that you can best
3 prepare your role in this --
Page 30Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
4
Q.
And I appreciate that.
My last
5 question was a little broader than you
6 answered it.
7 the Evers case.
8 any research that you intend to do that is
9 relevant to your opinions, generally, beyond
10
11
You answered specifically to
As of right now, is there
the Evers case?
A.
I'm doing a couple of things now.
12 One of the things I'm doing is I recently
13 discovered that I have access to the St.
14 Petersburg newspaper through something
15 called Google News Archive, which is very
16 helpful, and I've been -- begun a limited
17 review I haven't had time to complete.
18 that's in process and would not be part of
19 my opinions yet, but that is something I'd
20 like to get finished.
21
So
The problem with that is saving the
22 images of the newspaper because it doesn't
23 currently allow you to do that, so I'm
24 actually making notes, which, of course, I
25 would share with you all.
35
1
2
3
Q.
So as of now, you have notes on the
St. Petersburg newspapers?
A.
I have links that I've saved.
But
4 that's -- I've just started that, and that's
5 not part -- that's, like, work in progress
6 and I haven't -- but it's my intention that
Page 31Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
7 when I complete that, to add that to my
8 reliance, to take in what I've discovered on
9 that, incorporate it, synthesize it and then
10 move it into that category of reliance
11 materials.
12 Q.
When do you anticipate that you will
13 have completed that research on the St.
14 Petersburg newspaper?
15
A.
Well, I'll commit myself -- sooner
16 would be better for you, right?
17 would be helpful to you?
18 answer that.
19 work my way through that.
20 '50s, '60s and '70s on that, and I can have
21 that by -- give me until about the middle of
22 September on that.
23
Q.
Because it
You don't have to
This is mid August.
Let me
I intend to go
And do you agree that it would be
24 unfair for you to come to trial and testify
25 about St. Petersburg newspapers if I haven't
36
1 had a chance to discuss your opinions with
2 you on those?
3 MR. UITERWYK:
4
5
Objection to form.
A.
Yes.
I would agree with you.
And
6 just as a principle, I believe firmly and
7 hold in a high regard the idea -- the thing
8 that I respect about this process and value
9 is that there's no secret hand. Everybody
Page 32Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
10 lays their cards on the table so that
11 everybody can make the best argument and so
12 that the jury has the most complete picture
13 possible so that they, as the
14 decision-makers, can make a fair and
15 impartial judgment.
16
Q.
So, yes.
Aside from the St. Petersburg
17 research that you intend to have completed
18 by mid September, is there any other
19 research that you have in process now
20 relevant to your opinions?
21
A.
No.
That's the one thing that has
22 been on, like, a to-do list, and I haven't
23 had a chance to finish it.
24
25
Q.
I'm assuming you haven't seen any
photographs of Mrs. Loyd or anyone in her
37
1
2
3
4
family?
A.
I haven't.
Haven't seen nor do I
have in my possession anything like that.
Q.
Can you direct me, on your reliance
5 list, to any R.J. Reynolds documents that
6 you would anticipate using during your
7 testimony in the Evers trial?
8
9
A.
Well, I have some nice -- there's a
large number of R.J. Reynolds advertisements
10 in my files.
And, you know, I've got my
11 favorites, which I like to use, the
12 Camels Don't Get Your Wind, from the '30s,
Page 33Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
13 that theme; the T-zone ads from the '40s and
14 early '50s, the More Doctors Smoke Camels.
15
The other would be the Winston ads,
16 from a later period.
I've got some in
17 there.
18 Beverly Hillbilly commercials, those videos
19 which are in there.
The Flinstones commercials, the
20
I like those a lot.
I don't really have a lot of -- I
21 have some reliance documents in my stuff
22 related to the Winston Cup.
23 just tell that story, you know, largely
24 because I go to races, and have for years,
25 and I'm a fan, myself, of Nascar.
I generally
38
1
What else would help you focus your
2 efforts?
3 information, if I use polling information, I
4 have in my polling sub-file a PDF, I think,
5 or polling exhibits, where I've created my
6 own demonstratives.
7 to what I think are the most important in
8 the polls.
9 Q.
10
The art of -- you know, polling
Those are really a key
Would they be Reynolds polls or
polls, generally?
11 A. Polls, generally.
12 Q. Before we move on, let's sew up the
13
14
15
Reynolds.
A.
Those are the most important, from
the Reynolds perspective.
Page 34Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
16
Q.
And those Reynolds advertisements
17 that you just listed, you can't tell me that
18 Mrs. Loyd ever saw one of those
19 advertisements; is that true?
20
A.
That's right.
My answers are
21 consistent with what I gave this morning and
22 have always said that I don't make the
23 one-to-one connection.
24 They're examples of communications by the
25 manufacturer to the customer base.
They're out there.
39
1
2
Q.
And you are not a historian of Mrs.
Loyd?
3 A. That's correct.
4 Q. I'm just curious about this.
5 say "a historian" or "an historian"?
6 always wanted to ask this question.
7
A.
Do you
I've
I think most people, when you write,
8 say "a historian" because the H should be a
9 hard H.
That's technically the rule book.
10 But I think it's so much more comfortable to
11 say, when you speak, "an historian."
12 MR. UITERWYK:
13 I think the rule is, when the vowel
14 is starting the noun, you have to use "a-n."
15 When it's not a vowel, you use "a."
16
17
18
A.
Right.
But H occupies an ambiguous
position.
(Off the record.)
Page 35Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009

21
22
MS. CASE:
Q.
Have you seen your expert disclosure
in this case, as far as you know?
A.
No, I haven't, but I'm assuming that
23 it's similar to the expert disclosures that
24 I've been dealing with in other cases.
25
(Off the record.)
40
1
MR. ROSS:
2
3
4
5
6
I'm going to hang up.
I won't be
listening to the rest of the deposition.
(Exhibits 2 through 5 were marked.)
MS. CASE:
Q.
Professor, I've just handed you what
7 have been marked Plaintiff's 3, 4 and 5 that
8 Mr. Uiterwyk just handed me.
9 e-mails that you were referring to before
Are these the
10 that indicate your correspondence with his
11 law firm?
12
A.
Yes.
And the takeaway point is that
13 there's clearly a -- well, a -- I guess the
14 Jack Duane Smith file, which is an MHT file,
15 that one, I didn't review.
16 slipped past me.
17
18
Q.
So that one
Can I look at those for a moment?
Because we only have the single copy.
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. So, just for the record, Exhibit 3
21
is an e-mail on Tuesday, August 4th, 2009,
Page 36Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
22 from Mr. Bigger, addressed to you, and
23 copying a handful of people, and that
24 discusses scheduling.
25 that?
Would you agree with
41
1 A. Yes.
2 Q. And Exhibit 4 is an e-mail from
3 Yvonne DeAntoneo, in Mr. Uiterwyk's office,
4 addressed to you and copying Mr. Bigger, and
5 attaching the depositions of Amber Norris,
6 Vickie Gilmore and Jack Smith.
7 A. That's correct.
8 Q. And that's dated July 12th of this
9
year.
Do you agree?
10 A. That's correct.
11 Q. And, finally, Exhibit 5, dated July
12 20th of this year, is another e-mail from
13 Yvonne DeAntoneo, in Mr. Uiterwyk's office,
14 to you and Mr. Bigger, attaching Cindy
15 Evers' deposition and two amended verified
16 worksheets.
Would you agree with that?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. So are these the -- do Exhibits 3, 4
19 and 5 represent the entirety of e-mail
20 communications that you've had with anyone
21 in Mr. Uiterwyk's law firm relating to the
22 Evers case?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. I think you told me before that you
Page 37Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
25
had Mr. Loyd's deposition; is that true?
42
1 A.
Yes.
That's what I -- yes.
So I do
2 have that.
3 Q. How did you obtain Mr. --
4 A. They also sent me a CD, you know.
5 have a Cindy Evers CD on my desk, and that's
6 in there, too.
I
7
Q.
So would you agree that Exhibits 3,
8 4 and 5 do not show an attachment of a
9 deposition of Ellis Loyd?
10 A. Right.
11 Q. And so you also have a CD of
12
13
materials relating to this case?
A.
Yeah.
They sent me an envelope, a
14 CD, just with "Cindy Evers" written on it,
15 and I put that on my hard drive.
16 actually, that's really where I got the
17 three depositions.
18 these, I realized that I actually had more
19 material that I had not reviewed but that
20 they had sent me.
21
22
23
Q.
And,
In digging through
So can you describe to me the
contents of that CD you just referred to?
A.
Yes.
That's got a two-volume Cindy
24 Evers deposition and then two other
25 depositions by her daughter and husband.
Page 38Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
43
1 Q. Which daughter?
2 A. I can't remember.
I'll have to go
3 back and look.
4 are welcome to -- there's no secret here.
5
Q.
You can come with me.
You
And would it be possible for you to
6 burn us a copy of that CD that you received
7 from Mr. Uiterwyk's office?
8
9
A.
Yes.
Or do you have a stick or
something like that?
10 Q. I do have a stick.
11 A. I'll put it on the stick.
12
13
be quicker.
Q.
It will
CD burning is slow.
Sounds good.
Before we discuss the
14 e-mails, I marked Exhibit 2, so I'm going to
15 hand that to you.
16 Plaintiff's Fourth Amended Expert Witness
17 Disclosure as to Louis Kyriakoudes, Ph.D.,
18 Only.
And Exhibit 2 is
Do you see that?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And if you could review for me -- I
21 think the part that I'd say I'm most
22 interested in relates to what your opinions
23 are described as being.
24 look at -- I think the first two pages are
25 where that really is, so if you want to take
So if you want to
44
1
a second and look through that.

I've read that. Uh-huh.
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. And would you say that the text
4 listed in Exhibit 2 fairly describes the
5 scope of the opinions you would intend to
6 give in this case?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. I'm going to direct your attention
9
to just beneath your name in the middle of
10 the first page of Exhibit 2.
It's listed
11 and underlined, "Generic and Potentially
12 Case Specific."
Do you see that?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. Do you have any understanding of
15
16
what that means?
A.
Generic, as it would apply to any
17 case, anywhere, about the industry.
18 Anything that case-specific, anything that
19 might touch on the specifics of the case,
20 the plaintiff or any particular activity
21 unique to the plaintiff.
22
Q.
And that is my understanding, as
23 well.
Do you know if there was a time in
24 this case that you were listed exclusively
25 as a generic expert?
45
1
A.
Oh, I don't keep up with that.
I
2 don't know what -- I mean, the paperwork
3 that goes to the judge, no, I don't know if
4 I was or not.
Page 405
Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
Have you ever had any communication
Q.
6 with anyone regarding your testimony being
7 changed from generic to case-specific?
8 MR. UITERWYK:
9
I'm going to object to that to the
10 extent it calls for work product.
11 broad.
12 suggest you not answer the question as
13 phrased.
14 MS. CASE:
15
It's
I don't know who you talked to.
Q.
I
Do you have any reason to believe
16 that you were initially listed as a generic
17 witness in this case?
18
A.
If I was listed as a generic witness
19 and moved to a case-specific, it might be
20 because possibly they initially intended to
21 use the video, and maybe they changed their
22 mind and wanted to expand the scope of my
23 testimony to things I didn't talk about in
24 the video.
25 Q.
Well, I'm not asking you to
46
1 speculate about why they may have made the
2 change.
3 to believe that a change was ever made.
4
I'm asking if you have any reason
A.
I just wouldn't even know about
5 that.
6 up with.
7
Q.
I mean, that's not something I keep
That's all I wanted to --
Page 418 A. Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
I have no idea.
9 Q. So you were never involved in any
10 discussions about whether your testimony
11 would be generic or case-specific with
12 anyone from the Uiterwyk firm?
13
A.
No.
No.
I've been very consistent
14 in my testimony, and I think it's a very
15 well-known, widely understood by people
16 involved in this.
17
Q.
Before I get too much further into
18 this, I believe that we've agreed that since
19 Professor Kyriakoudes hasn't, in detail,
20 reviewed the --
21 MR. UITERWYK:
22
Let's go off the record.
23
24
(Off the record.)
MS. CASE:
25
We've agreed that we're going to
47
1 keep plugging along and hope to get done in
2 the next 20 minutes.
3 possible.
4 that you review information that you haven't
5 reviewed as of today and you intend to use
6 that in any way at trial, that I will be
7 entitled to come back and depose you on
8 those particular issues.
9 understanding?
10 understanding?
Perhaps that's
We have agreed that to the extent
Is that your
Is that everyone's
Page 42Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
11
MR. UITERWYK:
12
That's my understanding.
To the
13 extent that he reviews any additional
14 information beyond what he's already
15 reviewed that may change or add to his
16 opinions.
17 MS. CASE:
18
Q.
And as of today, just to be sure, in
19 the context of this discussion, that you've
20 reviewed Cindy Evers' deposition and Ellis
21 Loyd's deposition, and that is the entirety
22 of materials you've reviewed, correct?
23
A.
That's correct, and superficially.
24 So, yes, and I agree with all those things
25 you said earlier.
I'll make myself
48
1 available.
2 Q.
Okay.
I'm satisfied with that.
I
3 heard you testify a little bit this morning
4 and I've seen you testify in the past about
5 what -- how your opinions relate to what an
6 ordinary person would have known or seen or
7 been aware of or believed.
8
9
10
11
12
13
A.
Yes.
Is that fair?
You know, groups of people,
you know, typical people, yes.
Q.
Can you describe for me who the
ordinary person is?
A.
Well, let me describe it by looking
at how I derive it because it's from the
Page 43Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
I mean, it's from the -- it's from
14 data.
15 the research and the evidence.
16
And so what we have, we have two
17 broad classes of information.
We have a
18 class of information which is information
19 that's put through media, everything, you
20 know, printed materials, radio, people
21 discussing the issues, school textbooks, all
22 that stuff.
23 anything that anybody knows.
24 information.
25 account.
That's not really a measure of
That's
And you have to take into
49
1
It's like the textbook.
You know,
2 it's not what the student retains.
And as
3 far as I can tell, the only test that we
4 have where we can measure what people
5 actually knew are the systematic surveys
6 that are done, you know, following the
7 scientific principles of public opinion
8 polling and survey research.
9 talking earlier about Gallup polls, that
We were
10 would be an example, industry polls.
11 of those are very good.
12 are the things that measure what people know
13 and understand.
14
Many
Those, actually,
So it's not so much one typical
15 person.
But at any particular point -- and
16 I've done this very carefully and explicitly
Page 4417 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
in my direct testimony at trials -- I've
18 talked about classes of people who knew and
19 didn't know at any particular point in time.
20 It's not all one thing or the other.
21 1957, 38 percent of smokers expressed the
22 position that they believed that cigarettes
23 were a cause of lung cancer, as an example.
24
25
Q.
In
Can you give me what you would see
as some characteristics of an ordinary
50
1
2
person in the 1950s?
A.
Oh, well, I mean, you know, I would
3 rely on then someone who was representative.
4 And so what you do is you would take a mean
5 income, someone who earned a mean income,
6 somebody who lived in the geographic center
7 of the country, the population center, which
8 is a way of measuring where the center of
9 population is, the weighting space, you
10 know, who was of the average religion and
11 racial characteristic.
12 impossible to create a person who represents
13 all that.
14
I mean, it's
I mean, there is no ordinary person.
15 I deal, you know, as a scholar and, you
16 know, someone who is both a historian and a
17 demographer, with classes of people who are
18 representative, so samples that are
19 representative of a larger population.
Page 4520
Q.
Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
Well, I've seen your testimony in
21 the past, where you talk about describing
22 what an ordinary person knows and now you've
23 just told me that there is no ordinary
24 person.
25 two things.
So I'm trying to reconcile these
51
1
Can you tell me how, on one hand,
2 you can describe what an ordinary person
3 would know or believe and at the same time
4 not be able to describe the characteristics
5 of that person?
6
A.
Well, I think if I've talked -- if
7 I've used the term "ordinary person", I've
8 almost -- I've not reviewed all my prior
9 testimony in preparation for this, but
10 certainly, what I said, certainly meant to
11 say, was someone who was typical may have
12 fit in one category or the other.
13 let's say, know or didn't know, depending
14 upon the survey instrument used.
15
You know,
When I use the term "ordinary," I
16 mean it to mean typical, and "typical"
17 meaning statistically representative of the
18 larger population.
19
20
21
22
Q.
I'm happy to use "typical," if you
prefer typical.
A.
Yes.
And that's all I mean.
You
know, I -- you know, at any particular time
Page 4623 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
during the history of the cigarette in
24 American life, there are always those who
25 praise it and those who curse it.
And, you
52
1 know, much of the story, at least from the
2 history of the public health controversy, is
3 the story of efforts to persuade more and
4 more people to believe that it's harmful and
5 to persuade them not to smoke or not to
6 begin smoking.
7 It's contesting groups of people.
8
9
Q.
So it's not one person.
So would you agree that a typical
person would not be, like, a
10 multi-millionaire?
11 MR. UITERWYK:
12
13
Objection to the form.
MS. CASE:
14 Q. That wouldn't be the typical person?
15 A. Oh, yes, right.
Well, I said
16 earlier -- I must have misunderstood your
17 question.
18 typical, let's go with average income.
19 would be the median income.
20
Q.
You know, if you wanted to do
That
So a multi-millionaire would not be
21 within the typical person group, based on
22 that definition?
23 A. That's right.
24 Q. And neither would a person with
25
serious psychological problems fall into the
Page 47Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
53
1 category of a typical person, in the content
2 of your opinions?
3
A.
Well, to the extent that most people
4 are not beset by illness, psychological
5 illness.
Some people are.
6 Q. But not the typical person?
7 A. No.
8
9
Fortunately, most people don't
have that problem.
Q.
Would you say that by the year 2000,
10 the typical person knew that cigarettes
11 could cause lung cancer?
12 MR. UITERWYK:
13
14
Objection to form.
A.
I think -- I mean, I feel more
15 comfortable saying that, you know, by the
16 1990s, when asked are cigarettes a cause of
17 lung cancer, the response rate is very, very
18 high, 90 percent or above in the public
19 opinion research.
20 most people.
21 MS. CASE:
22
Q.
And so that is -- that is
So you would agree that by the
23 1990s, the typical person knew that
24 cigarette smoking could cause lung cancer?
25 MR. UITERWYK:
54
Page 48Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
1
2
Objection, form.
A.
Well, we have to deal with age.
3 This is the problem, we have the age issue.
4 Certainly, in most adults --
5 MS. CASE:
6 Q. Let's stick with adults.
7 A. Yes.
Adults, I think, have an
8 understanding that, to some degree, lung
9 cancer is a consequence of smoking.
10
Q.
So you would agree that a typical
11 adult in the 1990s is aware and knows that
12 smoking can cause lung cancer?
13 MR. UITERWYK:
14
15
Objection to form.
A.
The best I can say is that most
16 adults, a very high portion of adults
17 responded that lung cancer was one of the
18 causes of -- I'm sorry, that cigarettes were
19 one of the causes of lung cancer, and that
20 there was a high level of awareness in the
21 '90s on the lung cancer issue, yes.
22 that's -- that's -- I just don't like
23 creating a typical individual because you
24 deal with populations.
25
Q.
I mean,
Well, certainly, if 90 percent of
55
1 the population has a belief and ten percent
2 does not have that belief, you wouldn't say
3 that the typical person would fall into the
Page 49Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
4 ten percent that does not have the belief;
5 is that true?
6
A.
Right.
No.
I feel more comfortable
7 saying, given any average person you picked
8 off the street, given the representativeness
9 of the original sample, presuming that it
10 was a reasonably well-done representative
11 sample, that you have a 90 percent chance
12 that they will respond.
13 with probability, but it's reasonable to go
14 at it that way, nine out of ten chance they
15 would respond like the rest of the sample.
16
Q.
So exactly right
And by 1990, the response that you
17 would expect to the question, is cigarette
18 smoking one of the causes of lung cancer, is
19 yes, from a typical person?
20 A. Yes, in that regard.
21 Q. Would you say that Jacqueline Loyd
22 was a typical person?
23 MR. UITERWYK:
24
25
Object to the form.
MS. CASE:
56
1
2
3
Q.
As you've used that term in your
opinions?
A.
I'd say she's a typical smoker.
4 seems to be very much a typical smoker for
5 her generation.
She
6
Q.
I'm asking you about typical person,
Page 50Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
7 as you and I have just been discussing this
8 term, irrespective of whether or not one
9 smokes.
10
MR. UITERWYK:
11
12
Objection to form.
A.
Typical enough.
I'm not real
13 comfortable with this line of questioning
14 because you are creating an artificial
15 category here.
16 into one group or the other, I don't know.
17
Q.
You know, whether she fit
So you believe that typical person
18 is an artificial category?
19 MR. UITERWYK:
20
21
Objection to form.
A.
Well, it is.
It's like an average.
22 You know, nobody -- you know, the average
23 home in your community, no one actually
24 lives in the average home in the community
25 because that is essentially a mathematical
57
1
2
representation to summarize a large amount.
I mean, this is the problem.
You
3 know, you are taking a broad and diverse
4 population and you are trying to simplify,
5 which is good, because to simplify is a way
6 to understand something that's complex.
7
But what you are doing that's
8 invalid is you are taking another step and
9 trying to take a member of that population
Page 51Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
10 and say that member is identical to what is
11 essentially the mathematical representation
12 to summarize complex information.
13
And the danger there is, you say,
14 well, this person is typical in this
15 characteristic, and people then will think,
16 well, if she's typical in this
17 characteristic, she must be typical in all
18 the other characteristics.
19
But, really, all you're doing, when
20 you are dealing with a sample, this is just
21 a basic issue about the mathematics of
22 serving research and research design.
23 not trying to be --
I'm
24 I'm aware of the clock.
25 You know, you've got a complex
58
1 variable population, and you are trying to
2 simplify them, and what is typical.
3 what is typical in a particular response,
4 but you can't impart to that what's typical
5 in other things because you are just dealing
6 with this one quantity in this case of the
7 response to this question.
8 start breaking it down, well, you know,
9 there are variations within that sample
10
11
12
Well,
You know, you
regionally.
You know, one of the tables I have
in my reliance, when I've gotten the
Page 52Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
13 original data sets for some of these Gallup
14 polls, and rerun the data my own way.
15 of course, when you break it down by region,
16 southerners are much less likely to believe
17 that cigarettes are harmful, particularly
18 smoking southerners than their non-southern
19 counterparts.
20 even within the sample.
21
And
So you do get variations,
So you just can't -- what you are
22 doing is a logical fallacy of connecting
23 essentially the typicality of the
24 mathematical average or the median or the
25 mode, whatever you want to use, to the full
59
1 expressions of a person's life, and that's
2 not right.
3 Q.
You can't do that.
What you are telling me, if I
4 understand you correctly, you are not
5 comfortable telling me whether or not
6 Jacqueline Loyd fits your typical person,
7 artificial category, as you used the term
8 typical person, in your opinion?
9
A.
Yes, in all aspects of her life.
10 can look at her income.
11 figure, but we can see how close she is to
12 the typical income.
13
Q.
We
I don't have that
That's a measure.
So you would need to know Jacqueline
14 Loyd's income in order to tell whether she
15 fell within that typical range?
Page 53Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
16 A. Yes, on income.
17 Q. And as you sit here today, you don't
18
know whether she does or not?
19 A. I don't, no.
20 Q. How about whether Mrs. Loyd resided
21 in the population centers of the country, as
22 you used that term before?
23 today and tell me whether or not she resided
24 in the population centers, as you used that
25 term?
Can you sit here
60
1
A.
I know that she did not reside in
2 the geographic center of population, which I
3 believe, the last time I checked, was
4 somewhere in Kansas.
5 lived in Kansas.
6
Q.
I don't believe she
I use that --
So am I to understand that your
7 opinions are based on the typical person in
8 Kansas?
9
A.
No.
No.
You asked me about the
10 geographic center of the American
11 population.
12
13
Q.
That's a measure --
Was I using a different term than
you used?
14 A. That's what I was talking about.
15 Q. You were talking about Kansas?
16 A. All right.
17 Q. I'm trying to understand what
18
Now you --
"population center" means.
Page 54Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
19 A. Geographic center --
20 Q. Geographic center --
21 A. -- of the American population.
22 York weighs more than Mississippi.
23 a standard thing on maps.
24 every atlas.
25
New
This is
It's in almost
And, you know, usually, typically,
61
1 it's a little star and the star moves west.
2 In 1790, the geographic center of the
3 American population was somewhere in
4 Virginia, then it moves to Ohio because
5 we're moving west, and as California fills
6 up, and then it starts to move north, as you
7 get the great migration, as more people move
8 out of the south to the north.
9 artificial construct, like these other
10
It's an
measures of typicality.
11
It's as if you were to create a
12 scale in which you could weigh all the
13 people in America and at the point where
14 American would balance, you know, geography.
15 We're not talking --
16 MR. UITERWYK:
17
18
Dr. Kyriakoudes --
THE WITNESS:
19
20
21
I want to move it along.
MS. CASE:
I can tell you, at this point, we're
Page 55Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
22 not going to be done in seven minutes.
23 MR. UITERWYK:
24
25
How long are we talking?
MS. CASE:
62
1
Barring additional questions that
2 I'll need to ask him once he's actually read
3 the depositions in detail, today, I can
4 probably ask him at least another 45 minutes
5 to an hour of questions.
6 MR. UITERWYK:
7
That's okay.
8 miss my flight.
9 MS. CASE:
10
We'll just stay.
I'm happy to agree to return.
I'll
I'd
11 rather discuss this with him once he's had a
12 chance to prepare, as opposed to not being
13 prepared.
14 THE WITNESS:
15
I'm sorry about that.
You put two
16 on me in one day, and then the first day of
17 class.
18 don't know who insisted.
19 your office.
20 MR. UITERWYK:
You insisted on it being -- and I
It might have been
21 Let's get off the record.
22 (Off the record.)
23
24
MS. CASE:
We've just agreed that we will
Page 56Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
25
reconvene the deposition, barring a few
63
1 additional questions that I have, and we
2 will complete it again, but we'll complete
3 it by the end of August, once Dr.
4 Kyriakoudes had a chance to review the
5 materials related to this case in detail.
6 And defendants have agreed that we will not
7 use the continuation of Dr. Kyriakoudes's
8 deposition as a basis to continue the trial
9 date in this matter.
10
Does that comport with everyone's
11 understanding?
12 MR. GEARY:
13
14
That's mine.
MR. UITERWYK:
15
16
17
I agree with that stipulation.
MS. CASE:
Q.
The last couple of questions I have
18 for you, we'll go through real quick.
19 we took your deposition in the Barbanell
20 case, you told me that you have used, in the
21 past, some research assistants; is that
22 right? 23 A. That's right.
24 Q. And to short-circuit this, I think I
25
When
know what your answer is going to be, so
Page 57Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
64
1 we'll do this as quickly as possible.
2 You've had research assistants collect
3 materials at your direction; is that fair?
4 A. That's exactly what they did.
5 Q. Would it be fair to say that they
6 collect the materials at your direction and
7 then you review the materials and draw your
8 own conclusions?
9 A. Exactly, yes.
10 Q. Because you are the one responsible
11 for the interpretation and assembly of the
12 material and for speaking about the material
13 under oath?
14 A. That's right.
15 Q. And the research assistants don't
16
interpret the material for you?
17 A. No.
They are assistants.
18 Q. Would you agree that the opinions of
19 the research assistants do not meaningfully
20 affect your opinions in any way?
21 A. No, they do not, at all.
22 Q. So talking to or deposing your
23 research assistants wouldn't help me
24 understand your opinions any better?
25
A.
That's right.
65
1
Q.
And, likewise, any e-mail
Page 582 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
correspondence you've had with your research
3 assistants wouldn't help me understand your
4 opinions any better?
5
6
A.
No.
MS. CASE:
7
Okay.
I'm good.
8 to ask anything today?
9 MR. UITERWYK:
10
Anybody else want
On the phone?
Is everybody on the phone also in
11 line with what we talked about?
12 MS. RUIZ:
13
14
Yes.
MS. BAKER:
15
16
17
Yes.
MS. CASE:
Roger, do you have anything you want
18 to talk about today?
19 MR. GEARY:
20
21
I think that does it for today.

CERTIFICATE OF COURT REPORTER
I, MONICA SCHROEDER, Court Reporter and
3 Notary Public, in and for the County of
4 Jackson, State of Mississippi, hereby
Page 595 Kyriakoudes 08-19-2009
certify that the foregoing pages, and
6 including this page, contain a true and
7 correct transcript of the testimony of the
