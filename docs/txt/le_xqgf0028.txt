3	Peter C. English, M.D.
4	having first been duly
5	sworn, was examined and
6	testified as follows:
7	Direct Examination by Ms. Kurtin:	9:07 a.m.
8	Q. Good morning, Dr. English.
9	A. Good morning.
10	Q. How are you today?
11	A. Fine.
12	Q. My name, again, is Noelle Kurtin, and I represent the
13	United States in this action. And for the record can
14	you state your name again?
15	A. My name is Peter Calvin English.
16	Q. And what is your business address?
17	A. Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.
18	Q. And your home address?
19	A. [DELETED]
20
21	Q. I'm just going to go over some basic introductions.
22	This deposition is being conducted pursuant to the
23	Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the case
24	management orders in this case. It is important for
25	the record that I give you some basic instructions
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 5
2	and ask you some basic questions. You were given an
3	oath at the beginning of this deposition. Do you
4	understand that the answers today are the same as if
5	the answers were given to a judge in a court room?
6	A. I do.
7	Q. And do you understand that by this oath that you have
8	sworn to tell the truth?
9	A. I do.
10	Q. I am going to ask you a series of questions. The
11	court reporter is taking down everything that we say.
12	It is important that you understand my question
13	before you begin to answer. So if you do not
14	understand a question please ask me for
15	clarification. Is that okay?
16	A. I will do that.
17	Q. The court reporter will be taking down your answers
18	to my questions. For this reason please provide
19	clear verbal answers, no shaking of your head,
20	nodding if possible.
21	A. I will attempt to do that.
22	Q. Thank you. I will try to ask clear concise
23	questions, but if you are confused in any way please
24	let me know so that we can clarify. Is that okay?
25	A. I will do that.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 6
2	Q. If you don't hear any part of a question please ask
3	that it be repeated. Is that okay?
4	A. I will ask for you to repeat it.
5	Q. It is important that you allow me to finish my
6	questions before you start to answer and that I allow
7	you to complete your answer before I begin my next
8	question. If this is not happening please let me
9	know.
10	A. I will do that.
11	Q. Thank you. According to Order Number 150 in this
12	case I am to instruct you that at the beginning of
13	the deposition—I am to instruct you at the beginning
14	of the deposition as follows: You must ask me rather
15	than your own counsel for clarifications,
16	definitions, or explanations of any words, questions,
17	or documents presented during the course of this
18	deposition. You are to address your inquiries
19	regarding clarification to me.
20	A. I will do that.
21	Q. Thank you. If you need to take a break at any point
22	please let me know and I will be happy to go off the
23	record. The one exception is that if there is a
24	question pending I request that you answer the
25	question before you take any breaks. Is that okay?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 7
2	A. Yes. I understand that. Thank you.
3	Q. Have you taken any drugs or medication that might
4	affect your ability to answer questions today?
5	A. No, I have not.
6	Q. Are there any medical conditions or problems that
7	might affect your ability to answer questions today?
8	A. I have none.
9	Q. Is there anything else that might impair your ability
10	to tell the truth completely?
11	A. No.
12	Q. And if you're not feeling well at any point please
13	let me know or tell us what’s going on.
14	A. Okay.
15	Q. Thank you.
16	A. Thank you.
17	[English Exhibit No. 1 Marked]
18	Q. Dr. English, I’m handing a document that’s titled
19	"Amended Notice of Deposition of Joint Defendant’s
20	Expert Peter English, M.D., Ph.D." Have you seen
21	this document before?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And is this how you were notified about the
24	deposition today?
25	A. Yes.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 8
2	Q. Dr. English, did you prepare in any way for this
3	deposition?
4	A. I did. I reviewed the notes and articles, especially
5	the articles that I've read over the years on the
6	issue of smoking and health. I have read some of the
7	expert reports of experts on the plaintiffs for this
8	deposition. And I reviewed my own expert report in
9	preparation.
10	Q. And when you say you reviewed some of the expert
11	reports specifically do you recall which expert
12	reports that you did review?
13	A. I reviewed the reports of Allen Brant and Robert
14	Proctor.
15	Q. In addition to the expert reports did you review any
16	testimony or deposition transcripts taken in this
17	case?
18	A. I have reviewed a few depositions dealing with the
19	environmental tobacco smoke. As I sit here I can't
20	recollect which people those were.
21	Q. Okay. Do you know how many transcripts that you
22	reviewed?
23	A. I think three or four at this point. I've also
24	reviewed the deposition of Michelle Bloch, who was I
25	believe testifying on behalf of the low tar
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 9
2	cigarettes for the government.
3	Q. Okay.
4	A. I understand she has testified in a number of other
5	cases and I have not read those at this point.
6	Q. Okay. So as far as you know you're reviewed one
7	transcript of Michelle Bloch’s testimony?
8	A. One that was—the one that was taken in January or
9	February 2002. I understand she has done a few
10	others.
11	Q. Yes, she has. Overall how much time would you say
12	that you have spent reviewing documents in
13	preparation for this deposition?
14	A. Over 100 hours.
15	Q. Did you meet with anyone to prepare for this
16	deposition?
17	A. I did.
18	Q. And who would that be?
19	A. I met with Kevin Narko and Lauren Bernstein.
20	Q. Did you meet with anyone else?
21	A. Yes, I did. Michael Menton and Jim Cox.
22	Q. And overall how many meetings with attorneys did you
23	have in preparation for this deposition?
24	A. Three.
25	Q. And if you recall, do you know how long you spent in
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 10
2	preparation for each meeting, how long each meeting
3	was?
4	A. How long each meeting was: It was six hours for the
5	first two and about two hours for the last one.
6	Q. Is that six hours for each or six hours combined?
7	A. Six hours for each of the first two meetings and then
8	three hours—two to three hours yesterday.
9	Q. And besides the attorneys that you mentioned were any
10	other people present during those meetings?
11	A. My research assistant was.
12	Q. And who was your research assistant?
13	A. Martin Barna.
14	Q. Martin-
15	A. BamaB-a-r-n-a.
16	Q. And has this research assistant assisted you with
17	your preparation—in preparation for this deposition?
18	A. Yes. He has assisted me in preparing some of—in
19	reading some of the materials, yes.
20	Q. Is Mr.—it's Mr. Bama? Is Mr. Barna retained by the
21	tobacco industry?
22	A. No. He is my research assistant and I use him for a
23	variety of purposes in addition to this.
24	Q. In addition to the meetings were there phone
25	conversations with your attorneys in preparation for
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 11
2	this meeting, for this deposition?
3	A. I've had some very short telephone conversations, but
4	mostly that had to do with scheduling the meetings.
5	There was nothing substantive about the deposition
6	discussed.
7	Q. And correspondence, fax, e-mails?
8	A. No correspondence. One or two e-mails, but I think
9	that also had to do with the, you know, timing of
10	meetings, not—nothing of substance.
11	Q. So in addition to the time that you spent
12	preparing—reviewing documents and including all the
13	meetings how much time overall then would say you
14	spent preparing for this deposition?
15	A. I want to amend the over 100 hours.
16	Q. Okay.
17	A. Because I really was—was thinking more about what I
18	had spent in the preparation on this case. And
19	preparation of the deposition actually was less than
20	that.
21	Q. Okay.
22	A. Because I miss understood your question. I've
23	probably in preparation for the deposition spent
24	about 25 or 30 hours.
25	Q. Okay.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 12
2	A. So I am sorry for that mistake.
3	Q. No. Thank you for the clarification. So when you
4	said you spent over 100 hours preparing that's
5	including the preparation of the expert report for
6	this case?
7	A. Yes, right.
8	Q. Okay.
9	A. Right, yes.
10	[English Exhibit No. 2 Marked]
11	Q. Dr. English, I’m handing you a document that's
12	entitled "Joint Defendants Expert Disclosure for Dr.
13	Peter English. This was the cover page.
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Well, first, have you seen this document before?
16	A. Yes, I have. Yes.
17	Q. And the second paragraph of this document states that
18	accompanying this expert disclosure and report are
19	the data exhibits under information that Dr. Peter
20	English considered in forming the opinions expressed
21	in his expert report,a curriculum vitae, publications
22	authored by Dr. Peter English within the last 10
23	years, and transcripts of trial and deposition
24	testimony within the last four years. This material
25	may be supplemented as necessary. On the next page
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 13
2	of the document, it’s dated February 1, 2002. Is
3	that correct?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. Can you tell me, Dr. English, have you reviewed any
6	additional documents after February 1, 2002?
7	A. Yes, I have. And as part of the discovery in this
8	case I have read a considerable number of documents
9	that the Federal Government has produced in this
10	case.
11	Q. Okay. Have you formed any additional opinions since
12	February 1 of 2000?
13	A. No. I have—I mean, no. I have not made any
14	substantially different opinions than I had in
15	February 1.
16	Q. And are there any additional reasons for your
17	opinions since February 1, 2002?
18	A. I'm not sure what you mean by reasons.
19	MR. NARKO: Objection.
20	Q. The third paragraph the second sentence states that
21	accordingly he, referring to yourself, Dr. English,
22	may offer additional opinions or additional reasons
23	for his opinions as a result of his ongoing
24	professional review of data and information relevant
25	to his field or in response to issues that may be
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 14
2	raised by the plaintiff in this case.
3	A. Well, I-
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	THE WITNESS: Reasons would be based on the new
6	documents that I have read.
7	Q. And that has contributed to your understanding of the
8	issues in the case?
9	A. Yes. I've been able to fill in considerable detail
10	on some of these, particularly in issues dealing with
11	the government and low yield cigarettes,
12	environmental tobacco smoke, the issue of addiction,
13	a number of documents that I've read in—you know,
14	after February 1.
15	Q. Do you have a listing of the documents that you have
16	reviewed, the new documents that you have reviewed?
17	A. I do not have a list, no.
18	Q. And were those documents sent to you by your
19	attorneys?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. For the record-
22	A. Well, you know, I requested the documents and they
23	were sent through my attorneys, through the
24	attorneys, yes.
25	Q. When you say you requested the documents did you
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 15
2	request individual documents or did you request
3	documents on a particular subject matter?
4	A. Subject matter. What I—what I asked was what
5	the—just let me give you an example. I was very
6	interested in the Tobacco Working Group for example.
7	So I had read a considerable amount about the Tobacco
8	Working Group before February 1, but I did ask that I
9	receive, you know, all the documents that the Federal
10	Government had produced about the Tobacco Working
11	Group, if that gives you an example, as opposed to
12	any specific document. But then as I got into that,
13	then we--it would become clear that there were
14	documents that I hadn't seen that were referred to
15	and then I would ask for a specific document after
16	that point.
17	Q. How many documents would you say that you’ve reviewed
18	since February of 2002?
19	A. I don't have—I don't have the number. But-
20	Q. Estimated volume, a box, two boxes?
21	A. Oh, no. I would say much more than one or two boxes.
22	I would say 20 boxes, maybe more.
23	MS. KURTIN: For the record the United States is
24	requesting that defendant’s provide the documents
25	that Dr. English reviewed since February 1 for his
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 16
2	expert testimony in this case.
3	MR. NARKO: I’d ask just that you send a letter
4	so we can track this and not lose track of the
5	request.
6	MS. KURTIN: Okay.
7	Q. Dr. English, is there any material that you did not
8	review that you believe would have assisted you in
9	formulating your opinions in this case?
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	A. I'm continuing to review documents as they are
12	produced. But if I understand your question
13	correctly there’s no document that I haven’t seen at
14	this moment that I wanted to see or that I think
15	would change, at this point as I sit here.
16	Q. Okay. That was a difficult question, what did you
17	not look at that might have-
18	A. Right.
19	Q. A double negative. But I guess in reviewing you said
20	you’ve seen references to other documents that you’ve
21	been asked—
22	A. Right.
23	Q. --for copies of, and I guess my question was
24	following up on that. Is there a document that you
25	were made aware of in your review that you came to
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 17
2	the conclusion of that document would have assisted
3	you?
4	A. Now I'm even more confused by that. I think all the
5	documents I've read have formed my opinion.
6	Q. Uh-huh?
7	A. There's no particular document that stands out in
8	that regard.
9	Q. Okay. Dr. English, page two of this Expert
10	Disclosure cover sheet, it states that you are
11	compensated at $350 an hour in connection with your
12	work on this case?
13	A. That is correct.
14	Q. And is that your current rate of compensation?
15	A. That is.
16	Q. Are there any daily caps? For instance, in some
17	other instances there have been a daily rate for
18	testimony.
19	A. No, no.
20	Q. Are there any arrangements such as that?
21	A. I have this same rate.
22	Q. And can you estimate how much money you have billed
23	working on this case to date?
24	A. Between 125 and $130,000.
25	Q. And Dr. English, do you expect to testify if this
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 18
2	case goes to trial?
3	MR. NARKO: Objection.
4	A. I'll testify if asked, yes.
5	Q. Okay. And you did mention that you're continuing to
6	view documents as they are produced. Is it your
7	intention to continue to review documents and
8	participate as—and provide expert services to the
9	defendants?
10	A. Yes, I will.
11	Q. Okay. Dr. English, in what area of expertise are you
12	being offered as an expert witness in this case?
13	MR. NARKO: Objection.
14	A. I am a historian of medicine, a historian of
15	medicine, a historian of public health.
16	Q. And Dr. English, who else is generally considered an
17	expert in thi s field ?
18	A. You know, that's a lawyer's determination rather than
19	a historian's. Historians of medicine are a group
20	of—historians are a recognized branch of the history
21	field. It’s also a recognized branch of the—of the
22	medical field. We have an association, journals. We
23	don't really necessarily designate one or two
24	individuals as experts. You know, usually I think
25	of, you know, people who are—who are in the top of
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 19
2	the field as having academic appointments at major
3	universities in the history of medicine. I suppose
4	there are, you know, 80 or 100 of historians of
5	medicine employed in this country, maybe more. But
6	that would be a ball park figure.
7	Q. If you had to name the top three in terms of
8	credentials—
9	A. I couldn't name those, no.
10	Q. The top five?
11	A. I can't name that. That’s just not something I’ve
12	ever even thought about.
13	Q. And you mentioned that there are journals and
14	publications that are published in this field?
15	A. Yes. There are two journals in this country, The
16	Bulletin of the History of Medicine and The Journal
17	of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences.
18	Q. And those are peer reviewed—
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. --journals? And have you published in those
21	journals?
22	A. No, I have not. I have served on the editorial board
23	of both of them and I have reviewed manuscripts for
24	them. But I have put my publications in other
25	journals.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 20
2	Q. You anticipated my next question. Have you published
3	before in peer review journals?
4	A. Yes. I believe every publication I have published on
5	my CV is a peer reviewed publication.
6	Q. Dr. English, in addition to being an expert—fm
7	sorry, strike that. In addition to the history of
8	medicine and the history of public health are there
9	any other areas in which you would consider yourself
10	an expert?
11	A. Well, I’m a pediatrician. So I consider myself an
12	expert at being a pediatrician. The history of
13	medicine and medicine as a whole, it is such a big
14	field I don’t know whether you want me to comb down
15	any more specifically than just talking about that
16	broadly.
17	Q. Well, I guess my question is, do you have any
18	specialized knowledge in other areas?
19	A. Can you—are you—I—I mean, can you help me out in
20	the sense of what—what you're driving at?
21	Q. Why don’t we come back to that topic later.
22	A. Sure.
23	Q. Okay. Has any court of law ever refused to qualify
24	you as an expert?
25	A. No.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 21
2	Q. Dr. English, can you give me a brief summary
3	of—we’re going to go through your expert report in
4	more detail, but is—do you have a summary of what
5	your opinions in this case are going to be?
6	MR. NARKO: Objection.
7	A. The summary—the best summary I would have would be
8	the report.
9	Q. Dr. English, have you ever been arrested?
10	A. No.
11	Q. Have you ever brought a lawsuit?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Has a lawsuit ever bee brought against you?
14	A. I've been named in one or two of cases—malpractice
15	cases against--where I was in the company of a large
16	number of Duke physicians. I believe those cases
17	were subsequently dropped, but I'm—I believe I was
18	named. I don’t want to hedge on this. I mean, I
19	never saw the legal documents involved, but I do
20	believe my name was mentioned on there as one of a
21	group of physicians.
22	Q. Dr. English, do you hold any professional licenses?
23	A. Yes. I'm licensed—yes. I am licensed to practice
24	medicine in the state of North Carolina. I also have
25	a Bureau of Narcotic and Dangerous Drugs License, if
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 22
2	that’s what you're also—which of course goes along
3	with the idea of the practice.
4	Q. And have any licenses ever been suspended, revoked,
5	or limited?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Have you ever applied for a license and have that
8	been denied?
9	A. No.
10	Q. And has there ever been a disciplinary action taken
11	against you?
12	A. No.
13	[English Exhibit No. 3 Marked]
14	Q. Dr. English, I’m handing you a document that's titled
15	at the top "Rule 26 Expert Report United States
16	versus Philip Morris, Inc., et al, Peter C. English,
17	MD, Ph.D." And my first question is have you seen
18	this document?
19	A. Yes, I have. I wrote it.
20	Q. Okay. Turning to page 18, is that your signature?
21	A. It is.
22	Q. And what is the date of this document?
23	A. January 29, 2002.
24	Q. And again, you anticipated one of my questions. But
25	did you draft this report?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 23
2	A. I did.
3	Q. Were you assisted in any way with the drafting of
4	this report?
5	A. I was. I worked with an attorney.
6	Q. And which attorney did you work with?
7	A. Stacy Pollock.
8	Q. And when did Ms. Pollock begin helping you with this
9	report?
10	A. I started working on this, I believe in November or
11	December of 2001.
12	Q. And did anyone edit or make revisions to your
13	writing?
14	A. No. I—this expert report actually built on an
15	expert report I had written earlier. I made
16	additional—I reorganized parts of it, made some
17	additions. What the attorney did in this case would
18	often times suggest minor changes in grammar or
19	wording, but the great—all—virtually all of this is
20	mine.
21	Q. And you just said that the document—this document
22	built upon a prior report?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. When was that document initially drafted?
25	A. It was drafted in preparation for a Blue Cross case
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 24
2	that was tried in May of 200L. So it was—would be
3	in advance of that, so probably a year in advance of
4	that. And I'm sorry, I can’t give you a precise
5	date.
6	[English Exhibit No. 4 Marked]
7	Q. Dr. English, I’m handing you a document that is
8	titled "Dr. Peter C. English, M.D. Ph.D. Expert
9	Disclosure." On page 15, it's dated April 3 of 2000.
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Dr. English, is this the prior report that you were
12	referring to?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. And were you assisted in any way in your preparation
15	of this expert report?
16	A. In the same general fashion James Rosenthal was the
17	attorney who did—I wrote the original drafts. James
18	would suggest occasionally wording or grammatical
19	changes.
20	Q. I'm just—sorry, I don’t—I'm not familiar with Mr.
21	Rosenthal. Do you know which firm he is from?
22	A. Arnold & Porter.
23	Q. And you said that you began your work on this expert
24	report approximately one year prior. Is that one
25	year prior to the date of the report?
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 25
2	MR. NARKO: Objection.
3	MS. KURTIN: Can you please clarify when you
4	began your preparation of this expert report?
5	A. I can't remember precisely when I started writing
6	this report at this point. I suspect it was a month
7	or two before it was submitted, but I really can't
8	tell you precisely.
9	Q. In drafting—I'm sorry, Exhibit Number 4. Is this
10	the report that was submitted in the Blue Cross Blue
11	Shield trial that you mentioned earlier?
12	A. I believe that's so, the case, yes.
13	Q. And did you meet with attorneys—in addition to
14	working on the wording of the report did you meet
15	with attorneys prior to drafting the report to talk
16	about your work and what the report would say?
17	A. I don't believe there was any—there were any
18	meetings that dealt with the report.
19	Q. Did you meet or speak with any other consultant or
20	expert during the preparation of your report?
21	A. In-
22	Q. I'm sorry—
23	A. —consult other experts in-
24	Q. In the Blue Cross and Blue Shield case-
25	A. No.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 26
2	Q. —in preparing that report?
3	A. No.
4	Q. And then for Exhibit Number 3, the expert report in
5	this case, did you meet with any—
6	A. No.
7	Q. You mentioned Mr. Berna, your research assistant.
8	A. Bama.
9	Q. Bama, I’m sorry. Did Mr. Barna assist you in any
10	way with—
11	A. No.
12	Q. --the preparation of this report?
13	A. No. This was written before—just to make sure
14	that's correct here—no. He joined me six months
15	after this was drafted.
16	Q. Did you have any other research assistant-
17	A. No.
18	Q. —assisting?
19	A. No.
20	Q. Now, between the time that you drafted, we’ll call it
21	the Blue Cross Blue Shield expert report, were
22	(inaudible)—
23	In the time that you—between the time you
24	drafted the Blue Cross Blue Shield expert report and
25	the time you drafted the expert report submitted in
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 27
2	this case did you do additional research in preparing
3	for the expert report in this case?
4	A. Not specifically for the preparation for this expert
5	report.
6	Q. But you did draft additional sections to be included
7	in the expert report in this case?
8	A. Yes. There are differences between the—
9	Q. Uh-huh?
10	A. --the two reports. So, yes. I did do additional
11	work to change this one, to bring it up to this one,
12	yes.
13	Q. And are there new sections is my question?
14	A. Some sections have been added. Some of it has—was
15	refocused to place emphasis on the role of the
16	Federal Government, the section on environmental
17	tobacco smoke was added completely.
18	Q. And then I guess my question was in order to come up
19	with these new sections did you do any additional
20	research?
21	A. I did—I did some. And also based on research that I
22	had done even prior to the writing of this report
23	that I just hadn't used for that report.
24	Q. Okay. So parts of it—
25	A. So basically, if I’m understanding your question, you
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 28
2	know, I did--you know, I used current research.
3	That's what all this—research from the past to make
4	amendments to this document.
5	Q. I guess what I want to do now is go back in time a
6	little bit and talk about the preparation—the
7	circumstances leading up to the preparation of the
8	Blue Cross Blue Shield report.
9	A. Okay.
10	Q. So when were you first contacted to provide expert
11	services for the Blue Cross Blue Shield case; do you
12	remember?
13	A. About three years ago. So that would be in the
14	summer of 1999.
15	Q. And do you recall who contacted you?
16	A. Yes. Murray Garnik.
17	Q. And he is with the firm of?
18	A. Arnold & Porter.
19	Q. And had you ever been retained by members of the
20	tobacco industry before that?
21	A. Yes. I had worked—done some research for Murray
22	Garnik earlier, 1988 to roughly 1990.
23	Q. And do you recall in connection—was it in connection
24	with a particular case or was it general services?
25	A. It was—the only case that I recall was a case called
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 29
2	Hanes.
3	Q. And when you were contacted by Mr. Garnik back in
4	1988 what types of services did you perforin?
5	A. I did historical research on smoking and health in
6	the years leading up to the first Surgeon General's
7	Report in 1964.
8	Q. And did you prepare any type of expert report at that
9	time?
10	A. No.
11	Q. Did you prepare any kind of written product for the
12	attorneys you were working with?
13	A. There is no written product, no.
14	Q. Did you have meetings with the attorneys?
15	A. I did.
16	Q. And did you discuss the results of your research at
17	those meetings?
18	A. I did.
19	Q. Did you meet with any—anyone other than attorneys
20	during that timeframe, 1988 to 1990?
21	A. Anyone other than attorneys? No.
22	Q. And approximately can you recall how many meetings
23	there were in that timeframe?
24	A. I really can’t recall a specific number. Five, ten,
25	maybe more. I just can't recall.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 30
2	Q. And were those meetings in North Carolina or
3	were—where were they?
4	A. Some were in North Carolina and some were in
5	Washington, D.C.
6	Q. And approximately how many hours do you recall
7	spending on that project?
8	A. Well, there's several hundred. I can’t be more
9	specific than that I’m afraid.
10	Q. Do you recall how much you were compensated for the
11	work in that timeframe?
12	A. I don't remember that. I remember my rate was $250
13	an hour at that point. I don’t have a figure. I
14	just don’t recall.
15	Q. And then in between 1990 and 1999 did you perform any
16	services for the tobacco industry?
17	A. No.
18	Q. In the summer of 1999 did Mr. Garnik contact you
19	about a particular case?
20	A. Yes. It was in regard to the Blue Cross case that
21	was pending in Brooklyn.
22	Q. And what work did you perform beginning in the summer
23	of 1999?
24	A. I had a number of assignments. One was to review the
25	state of the art issues on smoking and health that
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 31
2	led up to the first Surgeon General's Report.
3	Q. Excuse me. That was similar to what you done in—
4	A. Right. To review that—the second was to do
5	historical research on what the public health
6	community's response to this—the dangers of smoking
7	that were elicit—were first enumerated in the—not
8	first enumerated, but enumerated in the first Surgeon
9	General’s Report. And I can be more specific as
10	we're going to go on.
11	Q. Go ahead.
12	A. But basically what I was doing is primarily looking
13	at the public health community’s response to the
14	danger of smoking and health.
15	Q. And was that to the present day; what time period?
16	A. To the present day,m right. So beginning even before
17	the first Surgeon General's Report and extending up
18	to the current day.
19	Q. And that work led to the preparation of the expert
20	report identified—
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. —as Exhibit 4?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And was that expert report submitted in the Blue
25	Cross Blue case trial—case?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 32
2	A.	I believe it was.
3	Q.	Were you deposed in that case?
4	A.	I was.
5	Q.	And did you testify at trial for that case?
6	A.	I did.
7	Q.	Do you recall how many hours you spent working on
8	that matter?
9	A.	I don’t have a specific number. It—several hundreds
10	of hours.
11	Q. And do you recall approximately how much you were
12	compensated for your work on that case?
13	A. I don't have a specific number.
14	Q. Was it more than $100,000?
15	A. Yes. It was more than that.
16	Q. More than $250,000?
17	A. Yes. I think that would be right.
18	Q. Approximately $250,000 or more than that?
19	A. I think it’s—I think it’s more than $250,000, yes.
20	Q. Was it more than $400,000?
21	A. Probably.
22	Q. One more. Is it more than $500,000?
23	A. I don't think so, no.
24	Q. Is it a fair assessment to say that it was between
25	400 and $500,000?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 33
2	A. I don’t have a recollection. As I—I don’t want to
3	give you a false degree of specificity here.
4	Q. And just going back to the earlier work you performed
5	in 1988 to 1990, were you compensated—and I
6	understand you don't recall exactly—but would you
7	say it was more than $100,000?
8	A. Yes, I think so.
9	Q. More than $200,000?
10	A. I'm not sure if it was more than 200,000.
11	Q. After the Blue Cross Blue Shield work that you
12	performed did you perform any additional services for
13	the tobacco industry prior to the work on this case?
14	A. I have been asked to prepare for additional cases,
15	two or three cases and I've done some additional work
16	for those cases.
17	Q. Do you recall names of those cases?
18	A. One was a case in Oregon, an individual smoker case,
19	and her name was--her last name was Schwartz, and I
20	did some work for that. And I'm—and another
21	individual smoker case in Los Angeles, the individual
22	smoker is—last name is Bullock.
23	Q. Any other individual cases that you worked on?
24	A. No.
25	Q. Any other smoking and health cases not limited to
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 34
2	individuals?
3	A. There has been some discussion of other cases, but
4	those are the two that I’ve done specific work on.
5	Q. Do you recall preparing any specific expert report
6	for use in those cases?
7	A. No. For neither one.
8	Q. Did you review documents for those cases?
9	A. I did.
10	Q. Can you estimate how much time you spent working on
11	those two cases?
12	A. Probably about 100 hours for each one.
13	Q. And can you just give me the years, if you know, for
14	those--the work—timeframe that you did—performed
15	work for those cases?
16	A. 2001 and 2002.
17	Q. I'm sorry, you said approximately 100 hours for each?
18	A. Maybe less than that. I can't re—don't remember.
19	Q. And one more question. Do you recall what your
20	compensation was for those two cases?
21	A. Well, the same $350 an hour.
22	Q. Besides the deposition in the Blue Cross Blue Shield
23	case have you been deposed before; have you been
24	deposed any additional times in a tobacco related
25	matter?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 35
2	A. I was deposed in the Bullock case.
3	Q. And when was that?
4	A. May or June of this year.
5	MS. KURTIN: For the record, the United States
6	has not received the deposition transcript of Dr.
7	English's testimony in the Bullock case and we
8	request a copy.
9	MR. NARKO: Just have the same request, that you
10	put it in a letter so we don't lose track of your
11	request.
12	MS. KURTIN: Is it possible to get that before
13	Monday?
14	MR. NARKO: I don’t know.
15	Q. And besides your testimony in the Blue Cross Blue
16	Shield trial have you testified before in any other
17	tobacco related matter?
18	A. (Inaudible).
19	Q. Have you given any other trial—deposition or trial
20	testimony unrelated to tobacco?
21	A. I have.
22	Q. And can you just briefly tell me about those?
23	A. I have been deposed twice in lead pigment cases. One
24	was Alvin Wright in 1996, and one was a case
25	involving the State of Rhode Island in 2002.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 36
2	Q. And in those cases who were you testifying on behalf
3	of?
4	A. Of the lead pigment manufacturers.
5	Q. And have you ever given trial testimony—
6	A. No.
7	Q. —in any other matters?
8	A. No.
9	Q. And who contacted you about this case, the United
10	States versus Philip Morris, et al?
11	A. Kevin Narko.
12	Q. And do you recall when you were contacted about this
13	case?
14	A. I was initially contacted—actually I take that back.
15	Actually, the first person who mentioned this to me
16	was James Rosenthal. And that was probably in
17	November of 2001.
18	Q. And then when did Kevin Narko contact you?
19	A. I had a meeting with him in the first part of this
20	year.
21	Q. So January 2002-ish?
22	A. Ish. I’m not precisely sure of the date.
23	Q. Beginning 2002?
24	A. Right.
25	Q. And Dr. English, who are you testifying on behalf of
1	Dr.	English	Direct	Page 37
2	in this case?
3	A.	The defendants.
4	Q.	All of the defendants?
5	A.	Uh-huh. I believe that’s correct.
6	Q.	Going back to Exhibit Number 3, your expert report in
7	this case.
8	A.	Uh-huh?
9	Q.	And I think that's what we’ll be working with. The
10	first paragraph under the introduction states, "I
11	expect to provide expert testimony on behalf of the
12	direct defendants in the action titled United States
13	versus Philip Morris, Inc., et al, which I understand
14	is pending in the United States District Court for
15	the District of Columbia where it is assigned Civil
16	Action Number 99-CV-02496(GK)." Dr. English, what is
17	your understanding about what this case is about?
18	A.	I don't understand—know all of the legal details
19	about that. I understand there's a prosecution under
20	the racketeering ?? statutes of this country dealing
21	with issues of intent to defraud the government and
22	independent United—and the people of the United
23	States.
24	Q. Okay. And what is the source of your knowledge; were
25	you informed about it, did you do your own research?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 38
2	A.	No. Kevin Narko explained in the general sense what
3	some of the legal issues were.
4	Q.	And did you discuss the subject matter of this case
5	with anyone in addition to Kevin Narko?
6	A.	No.
7	Q.	Did you—
8	A.	And Stacy Pollock.
9	Q.	Stacy Pollock?
10	A. Right. Because I—yes. Those two.
11	Q. That’s the attorney you worked with on—
12	A. The preparation of—
13	Q. The preparation of your report?
14	A. That’s right, yes.
15	Q. Dr. English, have you read or reviewed the amended
16	complaint that was filed in this action?
17	A. I have read a—I have read a complaint. I don’t know
18	whether it was an amended complaint.
19	Q. That’s right, there was an initial complaint and then
20	an amended one. But do you believe it was the
21	complaint in this action?
22	A. I don't recall.
23	Q. Have you read or reviewed any of the discovery
24	responses? And when I talk about discovery
25	responses, the exchange of documents between the
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 39
2	parties. Usually they're called request for
3	admissions or interrogatories.
4	A. No, no. I have not seen any of those.
5	Q. I believe you mentioned earlier that you reviewed Dr.
6	Brant's expert report and Dr. Bloch's expert report
7	submitted in this case?
8	A. Yes. I have both of those.
9	Q. And aside from the ETS depositions that you mentioned
10	have you reviewed any other reports or testimonies
11	given in this case?
12	A. Not at this point.
13	Q. And I’in sorry, Michelle Bloch (inaudible)—
14	A. And Michelle Bloch, right. Went through them, yes.
15	But not at this point.
16	Q. Have you ever appeared before District Judge Gladys
17	Kessler in any proceeding?
18	A. No.
19	Q. And do you know her at all?
20	A. No.
21	[English Exhibit No. 5 Marked]
22	Q. Dr. English, I’m handing you a document entitled
23	"Peter Calvin English, MD, Ph.D. Revised November of
24	2001." Dr. English, is this a copy of your
25	curriculum vitae?
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 40
2	A.	It is.
3	Q.	Is this the most recent version of your curriculum
4	vitae?
5	A.	It is not.
6	Q.	When was your most recent curriculum vitae prepared;
7	do you recall?
8	A.	Sometime in 2002.
9	MR. NARKO: Counsel, to assist things I asked
10	Dr. English yesterday to print a copy of the most
11	current version.
12	MS. KURTIN: Okay. So you anticipated that I
13	was going to put on the record a request for it. Do
14	you have an extra copy?
15	MR. NARKO: I just have two.
16	MS. KURTIN: You have two. I would like to mark
17	it.
18	MR. NARKO: Why don't you mark that one and we
19	can make another copy of it.
20	MS. KURTIN: Okay.
21	[English Exhibit No. 6 Marked]
22	Q. Okay. Dr. English, this is a document entitled
23	"Peter Calvin English, MD, Ph.D. revised May 2002."
24	Is this the most recent version of your curriculum—
25	A. It is.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 41
2	Q. It is. Okay, thank you. Since I have just been
3	handed this new version can you tell me between
4	what’s been marked Exhibit 5 and Exhibit 6 any major
5	additions? If you want to take a moment to look at—
6	A. I don’t think there are any substantial additions. I
7	can’t remember what I—what changes were made in May.
8	Q. Okay.
9	A. There's probably in response to the—we have to turn
10	in current CV’s yearly to department chairmen, and it
11	could be that. But I don't remember which changes I
12	made.
13	MS. KURTIN: If we could just take a break so I
14	can take a look at this for one moment.
15	[Off the Record 10:02 a.m. - 10:15 a.m.]
16	Q. Dr. English, in the publications listed on your May
17	2002 CV do any of the publications deal with the
18	subject matter of your expert report in this case?
19	A. No.
20	Q. Do any of the grants that are listed on your CV, ones
21	that you have received, do any of those grants deal
22	with the subject matter of your expert report in this
23	case?
24	A. No.
25	Q. Do you teach any classes that deal with the subject
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 42
2	matter of this expert report?
3	A. Yes, I do. Smoking and Health I think is the number
4	one public health story in the 20th century. So
5	every course that I have taught has dealt with 20th
6	century medicine or public health as included—has a
7	section on smoking and health.
8	Q. And when you say "every course you have taught," do
9	you teach a number of courses per year (inaudible)?
10	A. I do. I—I—my primary appointment is in the history
11	department and I also am a primary care pediatrician
12	with an appointment in the pediatric school. So
13	between the two I am roughly half time at both
14	places. So I teach courses in the history
15	department, one course each semester.
16	Q. One course each semester?
17	A. Uh-huh.
18	Q. And that course has to deal with public health or—
19	A. Well, just for example, next week Tin starting a
20	course and it’s called 20th Century Epidemics.
21	Q. Okay.
22	A. And one of the epidemics that I'll be talking about
23	will be smoking and lung cancer in the 20th century.
24	In the spring semester I'm going to be talking—going
25	to be teaching a course on 20th Century American
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 43
2	Medicine. And again, smoking and health will be a
3	major component of that course.
4	Q. For the upcoming courses that you intend to teach in
5	the fall and the spring approximately how many hours
6	of the course would be devoted to smoking and health
7	matters?
8	A. In—it will be one week in the fall and it will be
9	probably two weeks in the spring. So in classroom
10	time a week is about three hours of classroom time.
11	Q. And you mentioned the fall class and you said you
12	would be discussing smoking and lung cancer?
13	A. Smoking and lung cancer, yes.
14	Q. Would it include smoking and any other diseases
15	besides lung cancer?
16	A. I would probably—another of the epidemics I'm going
17	to be talking about are heart attacks. And so in
18	connection with talking about heart attacks I'll
19	bring up smoking again.
20	Q. And approximately--do you—can you anticipate how
21	much time you will spend on smoking during the
22	discussion or the presentation about heart attacks?
23	A. Probably 15 to 30 minutes of—I’m not—I can't be
24	more specific than that.
25	Q. Okay. And for how many years have you included
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 44
2	within your courses presentations about smoking and
3	health?
4	A. Since 1978, ’79.
5	Q. And just a little bit about your history with—your
6	CV states that you are currently a professor of
7	history at Duke University?
8	A. Yes, I am.
9	Q. Have you been teaching one course each semester since
10	1978 or ’79?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. I mean, more or—
13	A. No. That’s-
14	Q. That’s been your course load?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Okay. Have you conducted any research on the subject
17	of smoking and health unrelated to your work in
18	(inaudible)?
19	A. No.
20	Q. Have you published any articles relating to smoking
21	and health?
22	A. I have not.
23	Q. And are you planning on publishing any articles
24	related to smoking?
25	A. Not at the moment.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 45
2	Q. Dr. English, in the publications listed on your—in
3	your CV do any of the publications indicate that you
4	provide expert opinions for the tobacco industry?
5	A. Do any of the publications—
6	Q. Strike that. Is Duke University aware of your
7	providing expert opinions to the tobacco industry?
8	A. Yes. We have to file a conflict of interest—a
9	potential conflict of interest report each year.
10	Q. Have there ever been any objections to your providing
11	testimony?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Going back to the work that you described for the
14	lead pigment manufacturers association, do you know
15	how much you were compensated for the work in those
16	cases?
17	MR. NARKO: Objection.
18	A. Alvin Wright—I can’t give you a specific number. In
19	the Rhode Island case, something around 30 or
20	$40,000, something like that.
21	Q. And for the other case, do you recall if it was more
22	or less?
23	A. I really don't remember. Sorry.
24	Q. Dr. English, what percentage of your income is
25	derived from your consulting work or your providing
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 46
2	expert services?
3	A. Over 50 percent.
4	Q. Is it over 75 percent?
5	A. I don’t think so. I've actually never done that
6	calculation.
7	Q. Do you sinoke?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Have you ever smoked?
10	A. No.
11	Q. You have testified that you are a practicing
12	pediatrician.
13	A. Iam.
14	Q. So what do you advise your patients about smoking?
15	A. Don't.
16	Q. And if they advise you that they do smoke what would
17	your advice be?
18	A. Stop.
19	Q. Is there a safe level of smoking?
20	A. Not as far as I’m concerned as a pediatrician. I
21	mean, I know as a--as a historian of medicine, of
22	course that’s something that the public health
23	community has struggled with over the years, whether
24	there is a—a safe amount. But you are asking
25	questions as a pediatrician—
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 47
2	Q. And that's (unintelligible)—
3	A. And no. Even though I—I have conversations with
4	children about smoking that extend back into even
5	before they go to kindergarten, and annually since
6	then. And they know my position is very—very
7	clearly that smoking is not a behavior that they
8	should take up.
9	Q. Is it possible for you to give an opinion about what
10	your recommendations would have been as a
11	pediatrician to patients in the 1940's?
12	MR. NARKO: Objection.
13	A. I mean, certainly as a historian of medicine and
14	knowing the—as I do what physicians knew about
15	smoking in the 1940’s, I think I—I could give a—I
16	could imagine what I would have done as a
17	pediatrician in the 1940's.
18	Q. Could you share that with me?
19	A. I think it’s from the point of view of a pediatrician
20	or a physician I—you know, I would say that, you
21	know, there are lots of information out there that,
22	you know, smoking had some health consequences or
23	made smokers cough, smoker, you know, sore throat.
24	Cigarettes were commonly known as coffin nails. And
25	so that there were, you know, certainly health
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 48
2	concerns at that point. So I—you know, I almost
3	certainly would have advised the children not to
4	smoke in the 1940’s.
5	Q. And in the 1950’s?
6	A. I think in the 1950's as the health concerns
7	increased, even though, you know, the Surgeon General
8	hadn’t reached his determination yet there certainly
9	were increasing concerns about health risks. I think
10	that definitely as a pediatrician probably would have
11	made my patients aware of the risks and at some point
12	probably advise them not to smoke.
13	Q. Then taking it to the 1960's?
14	A. Well, you know, certainly you know, after the Surgeon
15	General's Report in 19641 would have counseled them
16	not to smoke.
17	Q. And then taking it to the 1970's?
18	A. Same.
19	Q. Would that be the same for the 1980’s?
20	A. Yes. My—and of course, at that point I was a
21	physician and then so it’s not a hypothetical going
22	back to a point when I wasn’t. But my advice to
23	children has been the same the entire time I’ve
24	practiced.
25	Q. Are you a member of any professional associations?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 49
2	A. I'm a member of the North Carolina Pediatric Society,
3	which is a component of the American Academy of
4	Pediatrics.
5	Q. Any others?
6	A. I am a member of the American Association for the
7	History of Medicine.
8	Q. And do you currently hold any officer or director
9	positions in those organizations?
10	A. No.
11	Q. Have you ever been an officer or director for any
12	professional associations?
13	A. I have been on the Council of the American
14	Association for the History of Medicine and held a
15	number of chairmanships of the major committees of
16	that organization. Those are on my CV if you want to
17	take a look at those. I have never held any offices
18	in the North Carolina Pediatric Society or in the
19	American Association of Pediatrics--Academy of
20	Pediatrics rather.
21	Q. Dr. English, why do you testify for the tobacco
22	industry?
23	A. Well, as I mentioned a moment ago, I—smoking and
24	health I think is the most important public health
25	story in the 20th century. And I think it’s
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 50
2	important that there be good history done. And by
3	good history I mean one that, you know, reads all the
4	relevant documents, tries to place events into their
5	appropriate context. And so I think it’s a very
6	exciting topic. I think it’s a very important topic.
7	And I think that so much of the history is actually
8	being played out in the court room. And I think
9	it—and history is a part of what's going on in the
10	court room and I think it's—I think it's very
11	important that the history that’s presented in the
12	court room be good solid history using appropriate
13	historical methods.
14	Q. And if you hadn't been contacted by attorneys for the
15	tobacco industry to perform services for them would
16	you have sought out work in that field?
17	MR. NARKO: Objection.
18	A. Well, as I—as I mentioned earlier, I teach this.
19	And so I would have, you know, taught this—and in
20	fact I taught it years and years before I actually
21	did any historical research for cases. So would I
22	have gone into the depth I've gone, no, I would not
23	have.
24	Q. When you say you've taught smoking and health issues
25	for years, that's prior to any services provided to
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 51
2	the tobacco industry beginning 1988?
3	A. Yes. I mean, I started teaching smoking and health
4	as part of my history of medicine courses and public
5	health courses beginning in the late 70's.
6	Q. And what kind of research did you do at that time to
7	prepare for your course work?
8	A. Well, I read the Surgeon General's Reports, and for
9	the most part that was what I based that on. Of
10	course smoking and health is a big part of my medical
11	education as well. And so I certainly used
12	components of that. And you know, I lived through,
13	you know, the 1950's increasing concerns. In our
14	family, for example, you know, we all read the
15	Reader’s Digest. And there were lots and lots of
16	articles about smoking and health in the 1950’s in
17	the Reader's Digest. And our junior history class
18	read major newspapers, and when the Surgeon General’s
19	Report came out in January of ’64 we discussed every
20	Monday for a month. And so I—so it’s—when I—in
21	my earlier work it was basically dealing with the
22	Surgeon General’s Reports, my medical education, and
23	then the fact that I have lived through those—that
24	important—for instance, what I did in those earlier
25	years for—back up with my teaching.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 52
2	Q. And then once you began to work for the industry in
3	1988 did the work that you performed for the industry
4	influence what you taught in the classroom after that
5	time?
6	A. Well, I learned a whole lot more, because I was
7	reading a lot of the—some of the scientific papers
8	for the first time in addition to the report. And so
9	I think I was able to give a greater degree of
10	specificity and detail in my classes.
11	Q. Do your students know that you testified for the
12	tobacco industry?
13	A. I don't mention that to my classes. I mean, I have
14	some students that know, but I don’t—I don’t
15	announce that in my classes.
16	Q. Going to Exhibit 3, your Expert Report in this case.
17	Under the second topic, "Opinions and Basis
18	therefore"—
19	A. Uh-huh?
20	Q. You state that, "Joint defendants have asked me to
21	testify about the history of medical and scientific
22	knowledge." Is there a difference between the
23	history of medicine and the history of science?
24	A. There is really a great degree of overlap between the
25	history of science and the history of medicine.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 53
2	Medicine is certainly a—has a—relies incredibly on
3	a large number of sciences. And so, yes. There are
4	differences only because there are some sciences, for
5	example, that you know, medicine does not rely on
6	much, such as you know, physics or astronomy and
7	aspects like that. But you know, in the areas of
8	biological science, the history of science, the
9	history of medicine has a great deal of overlap.
10	History of medicine is also interested in practice
11	concerns, public health concerns. And these are
12	areas that largely belong to the history of medicine
13	and not to much to the history of science.
14	Q. In the area of smoking and health would you say there
15	is a great deal of overlap?
16	A. I think there is some. I think—the way I look at it
17	is that there is sort of a scientific community
18	that—that community that's performing laboratory
19	experiments dealing with histories of smoking and
20	health. There is a medical community which is
21	dealing in specifically treating patients and giving
22	advice to individual patients, the care of illnesses
23	relating to smoking and health. And there is a
24	public health community which deals with the
25	organizations that make public policy decisions and
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 54
2	recommendations about causes, preventions,
3	treatments, what government agencies and all should
4	be doing for this particular issue.
5	Q. And when you say—so you’ve identified three distinct
6	communities, the scientific community—
7	A. But not the state. There are overlaps. In other
8	words, there are some people who did laboratory
9	experiments and then also, you know, part of the
10	public health community in making general
11	recommendations. There are some people who were
12	practicing physicians who didn't do laboratory
13	science, but never the less were on a public
14	health—so it's—I think there is a degree of overlap
15	between them. When I do the—look at the history I
16	look at sort of those three groups, the scientific,
17	the medical, and the public health communities.
18	Q. So each one has a slightly different story?
19	MR. NARKO: Objection.
20	A. Not really a slight—I mean, I don’t think there were
21	stories that one group knew and the other group
22	didn't. They had slightly different functions.
23	Q. Okay.
24	A. You know, someone sitting on, you know, the Federal
25	Trade Commission discussing, you know, a particular
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 55
2	guideline for advertising policy would not
3	necessarily be in the laboratory with Ernst Wynder
4	painting cigarette tar on the backs of mice, for
5	example. They both, I think, were generally aware of
6	what was going on that year. But they really have
7	different roles and functions. But it wasn’t as if
8	there was a body of knowledge that really wasn't
9	understood by one group or another I don’t think.
10	Q. Okay. I get the distinction. When you talk about
11	the public health community and their functions who
12	do you include as members of the public health
13	community?
14	A. Well, one of—I think that the public health
15	community's response to the dangers of smoking and
16	health was simply overwhelming in that—
17	Q. I don't mean to interrupt you. My question is who
18	comprises?
19	A. That’s my first statement there.
20	Q. Okay.
21	A. Because the list is very long.
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. And that’s why I was going to say that it’s a
24	difficult list to pin down. You almost have to go by
25	year. But let me give you an example. In the
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 56
2	voluntary public health organizations in this country
3	I think the American Cancer Society, the American
4	Heart Association, American Public Health
5	Association, and what became the American Lung
6	Association—used to be the National Tuberculosis
7	Association—were—in their local, state, and
8	national chapters I think those organizations had a
9	tremendous—state and local governments and health
10	departments had an enormous role to play. The
11	Federal Government is a major component of public
12	health organization dealing—the public health
13	community dealing with issues of smoking and health
14	even before the first Surgeon General's Report. The
15	agencies in the Federal Government that have been
16	involved are many, and we could go through some of
17	them if you want. It's almost too many to keep-
18	Q. Can you name the major ones?
19	A. Well, certainly the U.S. Public Health Service, the
20	National Cancer Institute, National Heart, Blood,
21	Lung Institute, the National Institute of Drug Abuse,
22	the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal
23	Trade Commission. Various groups dealing with
24	education, the Department of HEW, eventually HHS,
25	OSHA, you know, doing all the work related—you know,
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 57
2	there’s just many many aspects of the Federal
3	Government that have been in this.
4	Q. Aside from—you named some voluntary organizations,
5	state and local governments, many agencies of the
6	Federal Government; are there other areas?
7	A. Yes. I think that the public media, the public media
8	are very much in the public health community, because
9	after—especially after 1964. The media played a
10	vital role in getting the message out on the dangers
11	of smoking and health.
12	Q. When you say the public media, did the public media
13	have a responsibility to the public in health
14	matters?
15	MR. NARKO: Objection.
16	A. Well, I don't know how they viewed it. That's
17	something you’d have to—of course I’d have to ask
18	them about their mission statements. But I think
19	that they serve the role of informing
20	patients—informing the American public of virtually
21	every aspect of this debate, this discussion about
22	smoking and health. Even, you know, from 1950's on
23	there's a very well covered story.
24	Q. Would insurance companies be part of the public
25	health community?
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 58
2	A. I think so. And the reason I say that is that many
3	insurance companies would give advice to their policy
4	holders about various health issues and that smoking
5	was one of those. Some insurance companies at
6	various times also offer policies with differential
7	premiums for smokers and non smokers.
8	Q. Would the tobacco industry be included as part of the
9	public health community?
10	A. I don't think so. I don’t think that the, you know,
11	American public, you know, turns to the tobacco
12	industry for health advice. I don't think they ever
13	have.
14	Q. So the reason why the public—why the tobacco
15	industry is not considered part of the public health
16	community in your opinion is because the American
17	public didn't turn to them for advice?
18	MR. NARKO: Objection.
19	A. It’s just that in my, you know, research I don't see
20	that they have been part of the public health
21	community.
22	Q. Did the industry, did the tobacco industry ever
23	become involved with the public health community’s
24	research concerning smoking and health?
25	A. Yes, it did. The—and the best example of that is in
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 59
2	a collaborative work that the tobacco industry
3	scientists did with the Federal Government and in
4	independent scientists dealing with the Tobacco
5	Working Group.
6	Q. So I guess my question is if they participated, and
7	you say collaborated, why wouldn't they then be
8	considered part of the public health community?
9	A. Well, this gets into—this idea of mine, sort of by
10	spheres.
11	Q. I'm sorry?
12	A. In other words, talking about this scientific
13	community, the medical community, and the public
14	health community, and the overlapping. In their work
15	with the Tobacco Working Group in the tobacco
16	industry, they were largely interested in the
17	scientific and technological development of low yield
18	cigarettes. That was also part of the public health
19	community's quest, was that they had certainly in the
20	years after the Surgeon General’s first report, maybe
21	even going from a few years before, if the public
22	health community began urging Americans to smoke
23	lower yield cigarettes. And so there's an overlap
24	there that the Tobacco Working Group was affecting
25	the public health community’s desire to produce lower
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 60
2	tar cigarettes. And so I guess in that particular
3	sense, in that particular way perhaps they were part
4	of the public health community.
5	Q. So what—I’m sorry, strike that. Was the tobacco
6	industry's involvement with the Tobacco Working Group
7	important in the Tobacco Working Group’s work?
8	A. Yes. Absolutely important.
9	Q. It was absolutely important?
10	A. Absolutely.
11	Q. Did the tobacco industry know that—strike that.
12	You're saying that the tobacco industry participation
13	was important to the Tobacco Working Group?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And the Tobacco Working Group, is it also your
16	testimony, influenced public health statements or
17	directions about smoking and health issues?
18	A. No. I think it's more the other way around. The
19	public health community wanted low yield cigarettes
20	to be produced. The Federal Government I think
21	responded in a leadership fashion to promote low
22	yield cigarettes. In part of that the National
23	Cancer Institute formed the smoking and health
24	program. The key aspect of the smoking and health
25	program—the key was the Tobacco Working Group. So
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 61
2	it’s more that I think it's coming from the public
3	health community was the calling for this, the
4	Tobacco Working Group was the effector ann or one of
5	the effector arms of the low yield cigarettes.
6	Q. And of that group the tobacco industry was an
7	important part of—
8	A. Absolutely.
9	Q. —that group?
10	A. Absolutely a key component of that.
11	Q. Why would you consider that the tobacco industry
12	would be a key component?
13	A. Well, one of the ways I know that is I’ve read all
14	the minutes, I've read all of the reports of the
15	Tobacco Working Group. I’ve read the experiments,
16	the hundreds and hundreds of experiments that they’ve
17	performed. I’ve read the subcommittee reports. And
18	what the tobacco industry brought to the Tobacco
19	Working Group was the knowledge of how cigarettes are
20	engineered, all sorts of techniques that were
21	possible to reduce tars and nicotine. They
22	participated at all of these meetings and in a very
23	collaborative way gave the subcommittee reports,
24	served in a very key—in very key positions on that
25	group for the years that it was in existence, which
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 62
2	was—
3	Q. And those years were?
4	A. ’68, 1968 till it was disbanded in 1977.
5	Q. Now when the tobacco industry participated in the
6	Tobacco Working Group did they participate with full
7	disclosure about what the industry had found in their
8	own experiments or their own—
9	A. I think they brought—I don’t know what you mean by
10	full disclosure. They certainly came and
11	participated in these meetings, and certainly
12	discussed their meetings and brought information from
13	their research. So I assume that they brought the
14	relative information.
15	Q. I'm not trying—I'm trying to understand how you
16	formulated your opinion. As part of this Tobacco
17	Working Group and as an important part of this
18	Tobacco Working Group that the effective arm of the
19	public health community at any point then would the
20	tobacco industry come in—come in with—come within
21	the public health community for purposes of smoking
22	and health issues?
23	MR. NARKO: Objection.
24	A. I'm not 100 percent sure I just followed your
25	question. You mean other ways that the tobacco
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 63
2	industry participated, for example, the warnings on
3	cigarette packages. I mean, the public health
4	community wanted to warn Americans about the various
5	dangers. And then certainly in putting—in following
6	guidelines of putting warnings on packages, of
7	putting warnings on advertising, you know, putting
8	tar and nicotine yields on. They certainly were
9	working in that sense with the public health
10	community. That may not—I'm not sure I follow your
11	question, but that's—I think that's what you’re
12	asking.
13	Q. Well, I guess my confusion is, is you’ve defined the
14	public health community, you've defined it to even
15	include the public media, which covered—you said it
16	served the role of informing the American public on
17	smoking and health issues.
18	A. Uh-huh.
19	Q. And yet you say that the tobacco industry was not a
20	part of the public health community, and you've just
21	described a participation with the Federal Government
22	in this Tobacco Working Group that was carrying out
23	work that was directed; is that a fair statement,
24	directed by the public health community?
25	A. Desired—
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 64
2	Q. Okay, desired?
3	A. —is a better—perhaps a better word.
4	Q. And would the other members of the Tobacco
5	Working—well, I’m sorry, strike that. Who were the
6	other members of the Tobacco Working Group?
7	A. Well, the Tobacco Working Group had three components.
8	There were the scientists who came from the tobacco
9	industry. There were independent scientists and then
10	there were members of the Federal Government.
11	Q. Would the Federal Government scientists be part of
12	the public health community?
13	A. I suppose in some of their other roles, not so much
14	in their—you know, their tobacco working group
15	roles. But some of them, you know, would participate
16	in other discussions perhaps in the National Cancer
17	Institute and the Public Health Service or the—and
18	they might be affecting sort of policy
19	recommendations in those particular roles. You would
20	have to look at it perhaps on an individual to know—
21	Q. And the same for the independent scientist role?
22	A. Yes. I mean, people like Wynder would also from time
23	to time I suspect work with the American Cancer
24	Society, The Heart Association in addition to his
25	role as a laboratory scientist or an epidemiologist.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 65
2	Q. And yet the tobacco industry would not participate
3	with the public health community (inaudible)?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	A. Well, I think I've—about what work I think that they
6	did. You know, I think that they did work, you know,
7	very energetically with the Tobacco Working Group.
8	You know, certainly they have—you know, one of the
9	things that the public health community wanted was
10	the production and you know, of low yield cigarettes.
11	And certainly if you look at the, you know, what
12	happened to cigarettes in this country, they
13	became—all became filtered and they all became low
14	yield. I mean, certainly in that sense they
15	cooperated with the public health community. And
16	then of course the issue of, you know, warnings and
17	advertising regulations, they certainly cooperated in
18	that sense.
19	Q. Are low yield cigarettes safe?
20	A. Well, the public health community up until very
21	recently has thought that they—not—safe is—they
22	would never have called them safe. The public health
23	community would have said from you know, certainly
24	from the mid 60’s on, that they thought that they
25	were safer, at least with regard to lung cancer.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 66
2	Q. How about safer with respect to other diseases?
3	A. That gets more complicated and it depends on the
4	particular scientific studies you read. Some,
5	especially dealing with heart disease, there are some
6	scientific papers from the 1970’s on that would
7	indicate that there is a lower rate of heart disease
8	using low yield cigarettes. Some have shown a lower
9	mortality rate with low yield cigarettes. Heart
10	disease has been a little—has been less straight
11	forward than lung cancer.
12	Q. Has there been a controversy over the use of low
13	yield cigarettes?
14	A. In what time period?
15	Q. Well, let's go back to the 60’s.
16	A. Well, I think that the public health community,
17	certainly with dealing with lung cancer has—the
18	message has always been "stop smoking and don’t
19	start. But if you must smoke, smoke low yield
20	cigarettes." In other words, I don’t think there’s
21	been much controversy in the public health community
22	up until very recently about that recommendation.
23	Always of course with the proviso is that, you know,
24	stop and don’t start.
25	Q. And when you say "up until recently" when did that
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 67
2	attitude change?
3	A. I think in the late 90's people began, you know,
4	thinking particularly about the re-analysis of the
5	American Cancer Society’s CPS1 and CPS2 studies by
6	Dr. Tune, which were published in '97 or ’98 people
7	began being concerned about it. This coupled with
8	concerns about compensation led to the 2001 Monograph
9	13, which sort of brought together many of those
10	concerns. But as I--but I think these are—from a
11	historian's point of view these are—this is the
12	current events in that for the time period, you know,
13	roughly that I’ve been doing my research that the
14	public health community has recommended low yield
15	cigarettes for those people who would not—who refuse
16	to quit.
17	Q. Were there any other ways in which the tobacco
18	industry could be considered part of the public
19	health community aside from what you've mentioned,
20	the Tobacco Working Group and the warning labels?
21	A. And the production of—
22	Q. And production-
23	A. --low yield cigarettes. Those are the ones that come
24	to mind at the moment.
25	Q. Did they conduct their own research on smoking and
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 68
2	health issues?
3	A. They did.
4	Q. And did they communicate the results of that research
5	to the public?
6	A. I haven’t done a systematic research of what industry
7	scientists were performing. I do know that some of
8	their scientists published widely in the scientific
9	literature, people like Allen Rodgeman for example.
10	But that’s an area that I have not done research on,
11	so I can't give you a conclusion on that.
12	Q. Dr. English, I’m going to hand you a document, it's
13	titled at the top "A Frank Statement to Cigarette
14	Smokers."
15	[English Exhibit No. 7 Marked]
16	A. Uh-huh?
17	Q. Are you familiar with this document?
18	A. I am.
19	Q. Are you familiar with the Tobacco Industry Research
20	Council?
21	A. I am.
22	Q. And are you aware that it was later called the
23	Tobacco for Tobacco—The Council for Tobacco Research
24	USA, Inc.?
25	A. Generally aware of that, yes.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 69
2	Q. I direct your attention to the first side of
3	the—first column, near the end. It says, "We accept
4	an interest in people's health as a basic
5	responsibility paramount to every other consideration
6	in our business." And then skipping a paragraph it
7	says, "We always have and always will cooperate
8	closely with those whose task it is to safe guard the
9	public health." Have you—you said you have seen
10	this document before?
11	A. Yes, I have.
12	Q. And looking at those statements you would still say
13	that the tobacco industry was not part of the public
14	health community for purposes of smoking and health?
15	A. Well, I tried to mention a few moments ago, I think
16	that there is overlap, and I mentioned the areas
17	where I thought that those overlaps occurred. In
18	other words, I think their cooperation with the
19	public health community is best seen with working
20	with the Tobacco Working Group, the use of labels.
21	And one of the things that the public health
22	community wanted to do was to—was to have cigarettes
23	produced that were lower in yield. And I think in
24	that sense that they were—they were cooperating with
25	the public health community.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 70
2	Q. Were there other—besides the Tobacco Working Group
3	with respect to research were there other areas where
4	there was cooperation?
5	A. As I sit here I can’t think of any.
6	Q. And if the tobacco industry made public comments
7	about the state of research on smoking and health
8	matters what would their role be in—
9	MR. NARKO: Objection.
10	A. I'm not sure what you mean by what would their role
11	be.
12	Q. For instance, you have the tobacco industry pledging
13	to conduct research. At times they made public
14	statements about their research.
15	A. That’s a very hard-
16	MR. NARKO: Objection.
17	THE WITNESS: That’s a real hard question for
18	me, because by tobacco industry what do you mean? I
19	mean, there are many different companies, there are
20	components of companies.
21	Q. Well, what would you consider the tobacco industry to
22	be?
23	A. Well, that’s really not an area that I have studied
24	in detail. You know, I’ve been mostly—most of my
25	work has been in the state of the arts of concerns
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 71
2	raised by smoking and health and then the public
3	health community's response to that. I haven’t
4	really studied in any detail at all what the industry
5	did. So, you know, the idea of trying to define the
6	industry is hard for me. That is just not something
7	that I've studied.
8	Q. Okay. So you've studied the public health’s response
9	to the smoking and health issue, but you haven’t
10	studied the tobacco industry's response to the
11	smoking and health issues?
12	MR. NARKO: Objection.
13	A. I have not in any systematic sense studied tobacco
14	companies’ internal responses.
15	Q. I'm not talking—how about external?
16	A. And I have not in any systematic sense studied what
17	the Tobacco Institute said publicly.
18	Q. So the opinions that you’ve reached about the public
19	health community’s response to the smoking and health
20	issue did not factor in industry?
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	A. Well, I’ve certainly—I mean, I know what the public
23	health community was—was thinking. So in that sense
24	I think it’s factored in. I certainly have also done
25	very closely what the public opinion polls, so I have
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 72
2	a sense of, you know, what the American people were
3	doing. But I have not systematically gone through
4	statements by various aspects of the tobacco
5	industry.
6	Certainly in reading some of the expert reports
7	I've come across some in this case, in other cases
8	I've come across, but I've not made a systematic
9	research in that regard.
10	Q. Do you believe it’s necessary to conduct a systematic
11	review in order to formulate opinions on smoking and
12	health issues?
13	A. In my area—let the scientific community and public
14	health community, medical community anew, no, I don't
15	think it's necessary.
16	Q. Moving on in your report, you state that the history
17	of medicine is a recognized independent field of
18	study. Can you just give me some background? How
19	long has the history of medicine been a recognized
20	independent field of study?
21	A. Well, you can see elements of the history of medicine
22	in the ancient world if you read some of the
23	hippocratic documents. And so I like to think of it
24	as the first specialty. But if I could look at what
25	makes, you know, a specialized field of study, it's
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 73
2	when there are groups of people who are hired to do
3	that in universities, hired to teach the history of
4	medicine. When journals arose, when organizations
5	arose. I think you can see the origins of the
6	history of medicine, at least in this country,
7	roughly at the beginning of the 20th century. In
8	Europe I think you can see it as a professional
9	organization in the 19th century.
10	Q. And have classes been taught in the history of
11	medicine since the beginning of the 20th century?
12	A. And even before, because the history of medicine, it
13	has always been in part a component of the—of
14	medical education. And so courses in the history of
15	medicine taught to medical students have existed even
16	before then.
17	Q. You go on to state, "I will describe professional
18	standards and research and interpretation in the
19	history of medicine and the necessity of applying
20	these standards and historical methods in conducting
21	research in the history of medicine in general and in
22	the history of smoking and health in particular."
23	Can you describe to me what the professional
24	standards are in this area?
25	A. Right. I would do that by going to the next—
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 74
2	Q. Okay.
3	A. —sentence there. And you know, the issue of being
4	comprehensive, for example. Let's use the example of
5	the first Surgeon General’s Report. We know, because
6	the authors of that report tell us, that they had to
7	review 7,000 scientific publications as well as the
8	widely ranging views of public health organizations
9	and others. I think for a historian of medicine it's
10	very important to immerse oneself in that. Does the
11	historian of medicine have to read all 7,000
12	publications to sort of get to the same place that
13	the Surgeon General’s Committee did? No, probably
14	not. But they should be able to read very very
15	widely and placing it into the context and knowing
16	what was going on in the 40's and 50’s in order to
17	place the Surgeon General’s Report in 1964 into
18	context. And that’s standard historical method to be
19	able to place things into—into context. Monday
20	morning quarterbacking is sort of—is something—it’s
21	(inaudible), because you know, we all know sort of
22	how the story came out. We're all products of a
23	50-year public health campaign that has said that
24	smoking causes lung cancer and is dangerous in
25	causing other disease too at different points. It’s
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 75
2	hard to imagine--given what we’ve all lived through
3	it’s hard to imagine that there was a time when half
4	the physicians in the country didn’t believe that.
5	For example, as late as the early 1960’s, that takes
6	the ability of context, knowing how scientific ideas
7	are accepted over time. That’s what I mean.
8	Q. And are there primary sources versus secondary
9	sources of information?
10	A. Oh there’s lots, yes, yes. Primary sources of
11	course are the--are the individual scientific reports
12	and experiments. And you know, there are thousands
13	of those dealing with the issue of smoking and
14	health. I mean, you know, if we look at the period
15	of time between 1966 and 2002, if you went into and
16	did a Medline, which is a computerized search base,
17	it would be, you know, 50, 60, 70,000, perhaps even
18	more scientific publications. Yes. There’s lots of
19	primary sources. The American Cancer Society,
20	American Heart Association, lots of lots of primary
21	sources and teaching materials and work-place
22	materials. It goes on and on.
23	Q. And what about secondary sources; what are considered
24	secondary sources?
25	A. Secondary sources are people’s analyses. I mean, in
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 76
2	particular cases like this, people like Ernst Wynder
3	who is both a major scientist, a public health figure
4	has written on the history of, you know, his
5	involvement and other people's involvement. Richard
6	Doll has done that, others have done that.
7	Q. And the media's depiction of what was going on, is
8	that an important source of information?
9	A. Well, I think it is. I mean, I have looked at—I
10	went to the Readers’ Digest periodically, literature
11	which is the standard index for American magazines
12	and publications. I’ve done that from the late 40’s
13	to the current period, and gone through and read a
14	really a very large proportion of the—of articles
15	dealing with smoking and health to learn how the
16	media—I’ve looked at the New York Times, all the
17	articles dealing with smoking tobacco, health related
18	smoking related issues from the 50’s on, as well as
19	some other—I did the Associated Press for example,
20	to get a sense of that.
21	Q. Did you review other newspapers besides the New York
22	Times?
23	A. New York Times, I have done—in some cases I have
24	done the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times
25	in certain specific cases. I've also done, as I
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 77
2	said, the Associated Press, the New York Post, Daily
3	News, Long Island News Day.
4	Q. And for this case did you do a review of any
5	particular source, a newspaper in particular?
6	A. Not in—you mean additional to those for this? At
7	this point, no.
8	Q. And your work is built upon the prior reviews you’ve
9	conducted of—
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. --the magazines—the newspapers you've mentioned?
12	What other kind of documents would you review in
13	addition to articles in the literature and the
14	newspaper accounts, the magazine accounts?
15	MR. NARKO: Objection.
16	A. I went through the—what the major public health
17	organizations did. So for example, I read all of the
18	annual reports of the American Heart Association, the
19	American Cancer Society. I have gone—I’ve read all
20	the Surgeon General’s reports since then. I have
21	performed lots of computer searches. For the period
22	before 19641 tried to read, you know, every
23	significant article on the smoking and health issue.
24	Did that by generating bibliographies from index
25	(inaudible), by looking at the bibliography of the
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 78
2	first Surgeon General's report, among other things.
3	I've—I mean—
4	Q. Continue.
5	A. I mean, it's a huge huge topic. I’ve read the
6	reports of the Federal Trade Commission, for example,
7	to get a sense of what they were doing. As I’ve
8	already mentioned, I’ve read extensively in the
9	Tobacco Working Group and what it did. I’ve looked
10	at, you know, other agencies of the Federal
11	Government and I'll probably look at more.
12	Q. When you say you looked at what agencies of the
13	Federal Government did what documents did you rely
14	upon?
15	A. Ones produced by the Federal Government in this case.
16	Q. Did you undertake any independent review or research
17	into those agencies?
18	A. In--as reflected in the Surgeon General's reports and
19	other public health community documents—and many of
20	these agencies of course have published papers, and
21	so I have a reflection of what those agencies were
22	doing in addition to the documents that were produced
23	in this case.
24	Q. Did you conduct any interviews?
25	A. No.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 79
2	Q. Did you do any research at for instance the National
3	Archives for historical—
4	A. No.
5	Q. —or any of the Federal record centers?
6	A. No, I did not.
7	Q. Any private collections, historical accounts of
8	Federal employees, for instance?
9	A. Can you give me an example?
10	Q. Someone's daily logs or—
11	A. Yes, I have. I have read Louis Robins' diary. He
12	was the head of the Cancer Control Program of the
13	National Cancer Institute and the U.S. Public Health
14	Service from 1957 through '65. He had a daily log
15	which he typed and I did—I have read that
16	Q. And where did you obtain that daily log?
17	A. Johns Hopkins.
18	Q. So that was a publicly available document?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Were there any additional documents such as Louis
21	Robins’ daily logs, on individuals' thoughts or
22	reflections?
23	A. In the production of documents in this case I have
24	asked to see documents for all the Surgeon Generals,
25	and I haven't read them all yet. Some of them are
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 80
2	being produced. I’ve also—a number of the
3	head—heads of the National Cancer Institute, I have
4	asked to see their—to see whether those types of
5	documents exist. I don't know whether they do or
6	not.
7	Q. The last sentence of that paragraph you said, "I’ve
8	described the rigorous training that medical
9	historians undergo in order to conduct research
10	consistence with these standards." What exactly is
11	that rigorous training?
12	A. Well, I can give you in my instance. One is it's
13	a—it's a medical education. So I have knowledge of
14	medicine. And then I have a Ph.D. in the history of
15	medicine.
16	Q. Are there any additional courses you need to take or
17	training you have to receive outside of the education
18	or the M.D. and the Ph.D.?
19	A. That’s the basic pathway. Now, not all medical
20	historians have medical degrees.
21	Q. Is it necessary to have a medical degree in order to
22	be a historian of medicine?
23	A. I don't think it's necessary. I think it—I think it
24	helps to be conversing with the science and the
25	practice of medicine to have a medical degree. I
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 81
2	think it gives a certain sympathy for, you know,
3	issues that deal with patients, issues that deal with
4	diseases to have a medical degree. Gives you—gives
5	a language in the sense that medicine is filled with
6	terms that require a great deal of familiarity. I
7	think my, you know, 30 years of--almost 30 years of
8	practice gives me a certain sensitivity, especially
9	to clinical issues.
10	Can someone who doesn’t have a medical degree
11	learn the science that’s necessary to learn the
12	practice issues, sure. I think it's possible, I
13	think it's hard. I think it’s possible.
14	MS. KURTIN: Well, I’ve just been informed that
15	the tape is about to end and this would actually be a
16	good time for a break.
17	[Recess 11:16 a.m. - 11:28 a.m.]
18	Q. Dr. English, turning to your report and Section A,
19	Smoking and Health Before 1950. The first sentence
20	in that paragraph states, "I will testify about the
21	state of medical and scientific knowledge of smoking
22	cigarettes, lung cancer, and a possible relationship
23	between cigarette smoking and lung cancer in the
24	United States from the early 1930's to 1964." Did
25	you research the state of medical and scientific
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 82
2	knowledge of smoking and cigarettes in a possible
3	link to any other disease besides lung cancer?
4	A. I looked primarily at lung cancer.
5	Q. And in looking primarily at lung cancer did you
6	encounter articles about other diseases or you didn’t
7	(inaudible)?
8	A. Things such as smokers cough, I came up—but mostly I
9	was focusing on the issue of cigarette smoking and
10	lung cancer.
11	Q. You then state, "I will testify about prior to the
12	early 1950's there was no hard evidence that
13	cigarette smoking posed a serious threat to the
14	public health." What do you mean by the term "hard
15	evidence" in this sense?
16	A. The way the evidence emerged relating cigarette
17	smoking with lung cancer came from three areas of
18	science. The first is epidemiology in dealing, at
19	least in the beginning with good case control
20	studies. The second came from the area of
21	experimental biology dealing with sophisticated tar
22	painting experiments on laboratory animals skin. And
23	the third came from toxicology, identifying
24	components within cigarette tar, cigarette smoke.
25	I—you know, I have read the material before 1950. I
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 83
2	don’t think any of those reports reach to that level
3	of scientific sophistication. And that's why I used
4	the word "hard."
5	Q. So hard evidence means level of scientific
6	sophistication in this?
7	MR. NARKO: Objection.
8	A. Yes. In my sense that these—I think 19—the early
9	1950’s are watershed years. What went before, I
10	mean, one of the things we talked about, you know,
11	history of science and medicine, it doesn’t start on
12	a dime, doesn’t stop on a dime. Sure there are a
13	lot—there were reports earlier on. There were some
14	case studies, but there weren't good controlled
15	studies. They didn't have autopsy data that would
16	demonstrate that the patient did indeed have lung
17	cancer. There were some people who were painting
18	animals with—with cigarette tars, but their work
19	wasn't replicated. And there were some people who
20	were having—were identifying substances within
21	tobacco tar, but again, their work wasn’t really
22	replicated. And so I really look at the early 1950’s
23	as a watershed between some of the anecdotal
24	scientific and medical information before and what
25	came after.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 84
2	Q. Was there credible evidence prior to 1950 of the
3	association between smoking and lung cancer?
4	A. I don’t think scientific evidence. I mean, or hard
5	evidence. I like the word hard I think.
6	Q. Are you familiar with an article "Tobacco Smoking and
7	Longevity" by Raymond Purl, August of 1938?
8	A. I am (inaudible).
9	Q. Can you tell me about that article?
10	A. It was an early study that looked at morbidity and
11	mortality data between smokers and non-smokers and
12	concluded that smokers tended to live less
13	long—shorter lives (inaudible).
14	Q. I'm sorry?
15	A. Lived shorter lives is a better way of expressing it.
16	Q. And would that be considered hard evidence?
17	A. You know, I look at that as an early statement. I
18	don't think there was a lot of case control studies
19	there. I know that some—a lot of statisticians in
20	the 1950’s, looking back in that article, found
21	problems with it. I think it, you know, was an early
22	statement of concern about smoking and health. I
23	don't put it in the same category at all with the
24	various epidemiological studies that came about in
25	the 1950's.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 85
2	Q. How about the Alton Oschner and Michael Debique?
3	A. Right. Oschner and Debique, that's a good example of
4	the kind of things that I mean. Oschner and Debique
5	were two very prominent surgeons who in their
6	practice thought that they saw a pattern of relating
7	smoking and lung cancer beginning in 1939. They have
8	two or three papers in the early 40's, maybe going as
9	long as 1945, where they thought they could see a
10	pattern between smoking and lung cancer.
11	Two or three years later, beginning in 1948 and
12	'49 their patient—individual practices had grown,
13	they had different experiences, and they changed
14	their minds based on their surgical practices at that
15	point. And that’s what I mean about this early data.
16	I mean, it was—it wasn't case control, it was—this
17	was one or two surgeons' practices. They looked at
18	their date—they looked at their patients in the
19	early 1940's and saw one pattern, and looked at their
20	patients again in the end of the 40's and saw a
21	different pattern, but—and changed their minds.
22	Q. How about W.D. McNalley, "The Tar in Cigarette Smoke
23	and its Possible Effects" published in 1932?
24	A. It’s been awhile since I've looked at that. But as I
25	remember, that paper has no—has no case controls.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 86
2	In other words, they don’t have a control group in
3	that. Then again, that put that—that puts it in a
4	different category to these studies that came out
5	after 1950.
6	Q. Reviewing the literature prior to 1950, was there a
7	growing awareness of the possible effects of smoking
8	and lung cancer?
9	A. I think the—the thrust of those articles was that
10	there was a growing awareness that lung cancer
11	appeared to be emerging as a major health problem.
12	And initially there was an issue that comes up a lot
13	of times when a disease is first—becomes apparent.
14	And that is, is it really new or is it because we
15	have better ways to see it. And in this case, of
16	course, the better way to see it would be the x-ray
17	or bronchoscopy, which is a surgical technique where
18	the actual tissues can be observed. And so there
19	were a lot of people who thought that lung cancer
20	wasn't so much new as it was newly perceived. But I
21	think as the period went on, I think most people
22	began to think that it was really more lung cancer.
23	And then the issue was, what was the cause. And
24	most people I think thought that it probably had to
25	do with some kind of inhalant that people in the 20th
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 87
2	century were--you know, were being exposed to. And
3	there were many possibilities there. I mean, I think
4	a lot of people thought it had to do with air
5	pollution dealing with internal combustion engine,
6	asphalt, and from roads. Some people thought it was
7	a holdover or a hangover sort of from the influenza
8	epidemic of the 20's, maybe a reaction to
9	tuberculosis. There were a lot of things. In that
10	category was cigarette smoke.
11	Q. And when you say—
12	A. And so I know this is a very long way around to
13	getting to answer your question. I think cigarette
14	smoking was emerging from the mix of other possible
15	culprits in why lung cancer was increasing in the
16	20th century.
17	Q. And when you say—describe potential culprits, other
18	possible causes, what timeframe are you talking about
19	on this?
20	A. You know, I think people were well into the—well
21	into the late 40's people were still, I think,
22	speculating, you know. And in those speculations
23	cigarette smoking was one. But I suspect that—I
24	think there was probably air pollution and asphalt
25	and roads was even at the end of the—even as late as
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 88
2	1949 or 50 people still were thinking that that would
3	probably be the main reason. And that's what—you
4	know, that's what these studies in the 50’s did.
5	That's what—that's what makes it a really watershed,
6	is that cigarette smoking emerged from those new
7	tastes control, epidemiological studies in the
8	1950's.
9	Q. So when would you say cigarette smoking had emerged
10	as the leading candidate?
11	A. I would say certainly by the mid 1950’s as a leading
12	candidate. I mean—and these things can stop on a
13	dime. I mean, there were studies on air pollution
14	well into the 1960’s and how that would contribute in
15	different ways. And I think, you know, as cigarettes
16	became more tightly associated, and that's a
17	statistician’s term, more tightly associated, you
18	know, in the early to mid 195 O's.
19	Q. Early to mid 1950's?
20	A. Yes.
21	[English Exhibit No. 8 Marked]
22	Q. Dr. English, I’m handing you a document that's been
23	marked as Exhibit 8 in this deposition. And I
24	believe you refer to this document also in footnote 2
25	of your expert report. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I take
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 89
2	that back. You refer to Dr. Hammond in footnote 2 of
3	your expert report.
4	A. Uh-huh.
5	Q. This is a New York Times article from October 16,
6	1953. And I apologize for the poor quality. But in
7	the second column of the article near the end
8	actually, there is a statement, "The leading
9	possibility is smoking, however, he said." Above
10	that Dr. Hammond—describes, "Dr. Hammond pointed out
11	that smoking is one of the four factors that might be
12	linked"—
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. —"with the increase in lung cancer." And then, it
15	says, "The leading possibility is smoking, however,
16	he said." So would you agree that by 1953 cigarette
17	smoking was one of the leading candidates for the
18	cause of lung cancer?
19	A. I think Dr. Hammond is a sensitive barometer, only
20	one person commenting, but he was you know, in the
21	process of conducting a very important study. And I
22	think what he says there, he pointed out that smoking
23	is one of four. And then—and this is, you know,
24	coming at the end in 1953, he's indicating—you know,
25	I think if you want to read this—I want to just read
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 90
2	it, because it is here to see it. "Dr. Hammond
3	pointed out that smoking is one of four factors that
4	might be linked to the increase in lung cancer. The
5	others are concentration of exhaust fumes from
6	automobiles, dust from asphalt road, and air
7	pollution, and fumes from coal and oil furnaces. And
8	then the leading possibility is smoking, however, he
9	said." At least that's what the reporter’s take on
10	that was. You know, and I think that paragraph is,
11	you know, even as late as 1953, end of 1953, they're
12	still thinking of this as one of several
13	possibilities, cigarette smoking beginning to become
14	more prominent in that thinking.
15	Q. And you mentioned that Dr. Hammond was in the middle
16	of his—
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. —study at that time, in 1953.
19	A. Yes. And of course, you know, it was earlier on
20	there. I mean, it’s hard to find it in this
21	particular xerox. But I think he says there, "There
22	are a number of studies that link smoking with lung
23	cancer, he pointed out, but to the statistician
24	having said none is conclusive—I mean, I think what
25	he was pointing to is, you know, the reservations
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 91
2	that any good statistician would have, that
3	associations are not the same as cause.
4	[English Exhibit No. 9 Marked]
5	Q. Dr. English, I’m going to hand you an exhibit that's
6	been marked as Exhibit 9. It's a New York—it’s a
7	copy of a New York Times article from June 22, 1954.
8	The title of the article is "Cigarettes Found to
9	Raise Death Rate in Men 50 to 70." Are you familiar
10	with the results of Dr. Hammond’s study that were
11	published in 1954?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And what were the conclusions of Dr. Hammond’s study?
14	A. The conclusions were that smokers—heavy smokers
15	were—had a greatly increased chance of lung cancer.
16	Q. And on the second column, well, about half way down
17	the page there’s a quote from Dr. Hammond, fourth
18	paragraph that starts, "The American Cancer Society
19	had chartered."
20	A. Uh-huh.
21	Q. Dr. Hammond said that, "We found cigarette smokers
22	had so much higher death rates that we didn’t think
23	we could withhold the information another year." Do
24	you see where that's—
25	A. I see that.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 92
2	Q. So did Dr. Hammond believe that this was am important
3	result from his research?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	A. You know, I assume that he puts it as an important
6	conclusion.
7	Q. Was Dr. Hammond's study an informative study in the
8	progression of thoughts on the link between smoking
9	and lung cancer?
10	A. It certainly was one of them, yes, sure.
11	Q. Going back, Dr. English, to your report.
12	A. Uh-huh?
13	Q. Talking I believe about the increase in the rate of
14	lung cancer. You state, "From the start of these
15	observations physicians questioned whether this
16	increase represented a surge in the incidence of lung
17	cancer or simply improving sophistication in
18	diagnostic tools such as the x-ray. This puzzle
19	persisted well into the 1950’s." How long would you
20	categorize the puzzle that you state here lasting?
21	A. Into the 1950’s.
22	Q. How long into the 1950’s?
23	A. Well, I think, you know, one of the reasons I quote
24	the article of 1959 was that I think some of those
25	answers aren’t—(inaudible) are unanswerable, of
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 93
2	whether—how much of this increase was due to a real
3	rise in lung cancer, how much was due to x-ray
4	techniques. One of the issues they pointed out, for
5	example, was that many of the earlier studies did not
6	actually have confirmation from autopsies whether
7	patients who had been diagnosed during lifetime with
8	lung cancer indeed actually had lung cancer. And so
9	it was in some ways not a—something that could be
10	definitively answered. You know, I think the issue
11	that is—the reason, you know, that this
12	distinguished panel in 1959 even brought up the
13	subject would indicate that there was still—there
14	were still questions about that.
15	Q. And this distinguished panel you're talking about,
16	Jerome Cornfield, William Hazelton, Hammond, Abraham
17	Wilenfeld, Michael Simpkin, and Ernst Wynder?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. Going to that article that you quote in footnote 1.
20	[English Exhibit No. 10 Marked]
21	I'm going to hand you an exhibit that’s been
22	marked as Exhibit 10. I believe it’s the article
23	we're discussing quoted in footnote 1, "Smoking and
24	Lung Cancer, Recent Evidence and a Discussion of Some
25	of the Questions."
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 94
2	A. Uh-huh.
3	Q. Turning to page 198 of the article—the article
4	reaches a conclusion, however, that I'd like to
5	quote. "It would be desirable to have a set of
6	findings on the subject of smoking and lung cancer so
7	clear cut and unequivocal that they were self
8	interpreting. The findings now available on tobacco,
9	as in most other fields of science, particularly
10	biologic science do not meet this ideal. Never the
11	less, if the findings have been made on a new agent
12	to which hundreds of millions of adults are not
13	already addicted and on one which did not support a
14	large industry skilled in the arts of mass persuasion
15	the evidence for the hazardous nature of the agent
16	would be generally regarded as beyond dispute. In
17	light of all the evidence on tobacco and after
18	careful consideration of all the criticisms of this
19	evidence that have been made we find ourselves unable
20	to—unable to agree with the proposition that
21	cigarette smoking is a harmless habit with no
22	important affects on longevity.
23	The concerns shown by medical and public health
24	authorities with the increasing diffusion to every
25	young—younger groups of an agent that is a health
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 95
2	hazard seems to us to be well founded." By this
3	point in 1959 weren’t the studies that were being
4	published strongly indicating that link between
5	smoking and disease had been established?
6	A. Well, I think that this paragraph here—I think, you
7	know, that is in part a good summary in that it talks
8	about that there—that things weren't clear cut. And
9	that’s the first paragraph there. But that there
10	were—I mean, certainly enforce and re-enforce the
11	view of medical and public health authorities,
12	especially that they’re getting the message out to
13	younger people or to all smokers, that people are
14	beginning to say that this is something you need to
15	be aware of, that there are concerns out there in the
16	scientific community. Now, the question is, you
17	know, do the—did the authors of this group believe
18	at this point that there was sufficient scientific
19	evidence to reach a conclusion, for example, with the
20	Surgeon General’s Report, reach five years later, I
21	have no reason to doubt one way or the other—I don't
22	doubt what these men said in the formation of that
23	report. But when you look at the whole body of
24	scientific medicine and scientific public health and
25	medical information in 1959, the communities weren't
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 96
2	ready to make that determination. That waited until
3	the Surgeon General’s Report. But I mean, this
4	is—you know, this is a paper, an important paper.
5	But it—I don't think it represents in any way a
6	consensus of scientific opinion.
7	Q. So when you say the communities, was there a
8	controversy within the scientific community in the
9	late 50's?
10	A. Oh, sure. Oh, yes. I mean, remember, we went back
11	to the issue, for example, of you know, how did the
12	scientific information emerge. 1 mean, one of the
13	ways it emerged was in tar painting experiments
14	on—in laboratory animals. Some people were able to
15	do it, some people—some laboratories were unable to
16	do it. Some of the tumors on rat skin were benign, a
17	few were malignant. None of them to my—that I'm
18	aware of metastasized in the way of a—that cancers
19	are supposed to do. Another issue was that in none
20	of the inhalation experiments that biologists were
21	trying to show, in none of the inhalation experiments
22	did animals produce lung cancer. And so you were
23	left with, you know, some scientists being able to do
24	skin—a few skin cancers. Of course it's, you know,
25	skin, not lung. It’s animals, not humans. You know,
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 97
2	many many differences. And from the toxicology
3	studies beginning in 1955 there were some animal
4	carcinogens found. But as all of the studies were
5	showing that there was—in much lower concentrations.
6	They could account for lung cancer in—in humans.
7	Possibility—of course, these were only dealing with
8	skin cancers. But, yes. There were lots of
9	scientific concerns. Another area we talked about
10	was the epidemiological sciences. There were
11	prominent epidemiologists who did not think, such as
12	Joseph Bergsen in this country, Fisher in Great
13	Britain, you know, giants in the field who did not
14	think that the statistics at the end of the—even as
15	late as 1959 were enough to make a statement. Part
16	of that had to do with, you know, that statistics and
17	epidemiological studies had never been used for
18	causal statements in chronic diseases. And that
19	whole field of chronic disease causation had to
20	emerge, and lung cancer was—well, the issue of lung
21	cancer was at the center of that. So, yes. There
22	was a—yes. There were lots of controversies in the
23	scientific field at the end of the 1950’s.
24	Q. Were there controversies in the medical field in the
25	1950’s?
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 98
2	A. I think the best statistic about that, remember Louis
3	Robbins whose job it was to handle the Federal
4	Government's education of physicians. For example,
5	in the late—in the early 1960's said that literally
6	half of the physicians in the country didn't believe
7	it.
8	And you know, I can’t—of course with a
9	statement like that we can't say what—you know, why
10	did each individual physician not believe this. But
11	you know, it was—the evidence wasn't enough to
12	persuade practicing physicians. And that was one of
13	the big problems that Louis Robbins had, you know,
14	after—was figuring—was trying to reach physicians
15	in a way that was persuasive to them.
16	Q. Was there a controversy in the public health
17	community?
18	A. Well, look at the American Heart Association. For
19	example, you know, their first statement, I think
20	it's in 1956, and I think they expressed concern.
21	They reviewed it in 1960, and I don’t think it was
22	until 1963 that they made any strong statement on the
23	issue of smoking. The American Cancer Society in the
24	late 1950's started educational programs without—I
25	think without their society making an actual claim.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 99
2	They thought it was a sufficient public health
3	problem that they wanted to get the American public
4	informed of the various issues and so they started
5	educational programs. Yes. I think there was a real
6	debate in these communities.
7	Q. Well, what was the—what was the debate that it
8	had—well, what was the debate?
9	A. I think the debate comes down to the issue of cause.
10	I mean, what the—I mean, the strongest evidence came
11	from the epidemiologists who all agreed that they had
12	a statistical association. The question was, you
13	know, could you go beyond just saying something was
14	associated or something was caused. I mean, one
15	example would be is that cigarette smoking is
16	associated with cirrhosis of the liver. You know,
17	that's an association. That's a strong association.
18	But we know that it's—that smokers tend to be heavy
19	drinkers and it's the alcohol that causes the
20	cirrhosis of the liver, not cigarette smoking. It’s
21	that kind of thing I think people were struggling
22	with. You know, is—was there sufficient information
23	to make a causal—a causal statement.
24	Q. For the public health community would it be necessary
25	to have cause established before being able to make
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 100
2	recommendations from the public health community's
3	standpoint?
4	A. Well, I think—I think we have a good—let's look at
5	the Surgeon General, for example. You know, in 1956
6	he had a report. He, you know, and I think he
7	clearly says that, you know, the evidence—I have the
8	actual quote here--might be we could all refer to.
9	In 1957 the surgeon general, Burney, at the weight of
10	evidence is increasingly pointing in one direction,
11	that excessive smoking is one of the causative
12	factors in lung cancer." And then, you know, in
13	what—you know, so he made a statement. But then as
14	he explained it in Congress a couple of weeks later
15	is that he understood and he recognized that there
16	were a lot of scientific things that were not
17	understood. There were a lot of people
18	that--prominent scientists on both sides of the issue
19	of who were—but he still made a public health
20	statement based on that.
21	Q. So I guess my question is, then by the late 1950's
22	was there still a controversy in the public health
23	community that action needed to be taken with respect
24	to addressing the smoking?
25	A. Well, I think, you know, the Surgeon General, he’s
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 101
2	one component of that. As I say, the Heart
3	Association hadn't reached an opinion on it. I think
4	the American Cancer Society in 1957 had not reached
5	an opinion on it.
6	But certainly, you know, the Surgeon General,
7	you know, does have a—has a statement there. He's
8	not saying cigarettes is the cause. He’s saying he's
9	looking and things are pointing—beginning to point
10	in that direction.
11	Q. And then in 1959 the Surgeon General states that the
12	weight of evidence at present implicates smoking is
13	the principal biological factor in the increased
14	incidence of lung cancer?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. So by 1959 what was the state in the public health
17	community?
18	A. You know, this statement of course in the production
19	of the second Surgeon General’s report is something
20	we know a lot about, because Louis Robbins, the
21	person we talked about who left his diary and the
22	head of the cancer control program was the person in
23	the NCI, National Cancer Institute and the Public
24	Health Service who was the author of that statement
25	and indeed had meetings, you know, with prominent
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 102
2	scientists from within the government, outside the
3	government, statisticians such as Brooks, and he
4	started meeting in preparation of this statement in
5	1958, went through at least 40 drafts of that. And
6	so you can see the actual debate within the
7	government trying to determine it. Now, at the end
8	of the day, as Louis Robbins explains in subsequent
9	articles that he published, Dr. Burney decided to
10	make a public health recommendation. He did this
11	knowing that there was considerable controversy, even
12	within his own Public Health Service and the NCI.
13	Q. And your information about this, is it derived from
14	your review of Dr. Robbins daily logs?
15	MR. NARKO: Objection.
16	A. In part from Dr. Robbins—I mean, there are other
17	accounts of that, but primarily it comes from looking
18	at his daily logs.
19	Q. And what other accounts are there?
20	A. There's an account, Lester (inaudible), which talks
21	about the NCI. U.S. Public Health Service, there’s a
22	small account in there, you know. But it's primarily
23	from—
24	[English Exhibit No. 11 Marked]
25	Q. I'm handing you what’s been marked as Exhibit 11.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 103
2	A. Uh-huh?
3	Q. It’s an article by Louis C. Robbins titled "Medical
4	Practice and Lung Cancer"—
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. —from the Minnesota Medicine, February 1962. On
7	page 135 in his conclusion section I believe he talks
8	about the differences between the medical
9	investigator and the medical practitioner. And the
10	quote I'd like you to look at is second column,
11	second sentence—third sentence. "The practitioner,
12	on the other hand, has a different problem and a
13	different responsibility. His concern is for the
14	individual patient, not as an entity in a controlled
15	study, but as a human being whose life he wants to
16	protect." So by 1962 was there a controversy from
17	the medical practitioner’s point of view about the
18	smoking and lung cancer issue that warranted action?
19	A. Well, I mean, as I mentioned, you know, Louis Robbins
20	was faced with a problem that half the physicians in
21	the country didn't believe. I mean, Louis Robbins
22	believed that there was a problem that needed to be
23	addressed and educated. And so he was saying, that
24	was his job, was to try to, you know, to bring the
25	1959 Surgeon General’s message to the practitioner.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 104
2	This right here is one version of a speech that he
3	gave many many times. And other closely related
4	versions are in his papers, which is—give this
5	problem. What he was saying is that, you know,
6	just—you know, the first sentence in that is that
7	the medical investigator, however the evidence does
8	not add to conclusive proof. What he was saying is
9	that, you know, individual physicians advising
10	individual patients have to make decisions based on
11	the best way they can interpret knowledge at any
12	given moment. And he was hoping, you know, that the
13	advice to either stop smoking or slow down smoking or
14	not start smoking would be something that the
15	American physicians would be persuaded—
16	Q. But where—
17	A. Even if they weren’t persuaded on the causality of
18	lung cancer.
19	Q. So where would the source of the controversy be if
20	the public health community is stating—or if the
21	public health community is making statements linking
22	smoking and lung cancer and obviously coming to the
23	conclusion that it was an area that warranted action?
24	MR. NARKO: Objection.
25	A. Well, you know, the issue of, you know, why did he
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 105
2	have—you know, why did Louis Robbins have to make
3	all these, you know, hundreds of speeches similar to
4	this, and you know, why were physicians, half the
5	physicians reluctant to embrace this at this point?
6	You know, I can’t speak for all of them. I mean, it
7	could be that, you know, most people who smoke don't
8	get lung cancer. And that may be one reason why
9	physicians, you know, had to be persuaded. You know,
10	there's a—there was a long standing tradition in
11	medicine that, you know, statistics are just that,
12	they're numbers. And biological proof wasn’t there.
13	But you know, there's no question in my mind that
14	there was considerable doubt in the medical,
15	scientific, and public health communities into the
16	early 60’s.
17	Q. Going back to the Colin White article—I just have to
18	get the exhibit number. I just don’t remember which
19	exhibit number it is. Well, it’s not marked.
20	[English Exhibit No. 12 Marked]
21	I'm handing you an article, an exhibit that's
22	been marked as Exhibit Number 12. The title of the
23	article is "Research on Smoking and Lung Cancer—A
24	Landmark in the History of Chronic Disease
25	Epidemiology" by Colin White.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 106
2	A. Uh-huh?
3	Q. On page 36 Colin White describes the debate, I
4	believe a little differently. He states that "The
5	50's and early 60's may be considered to be the
6	period in which the epidemiologic data in favor of
7	the ideological tobacco and lung cancer were
8	marshalled, an opinion against smoking began to
9	crystalize. At this point in time, the 50's and the
10	early 60’s, was there still—is your opinion that
11	there was still a full-fledged controversy or
12	were—were there any leanings in any direction by
13	this time?
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	A. You know, I think the best way to—one of the most
16	sensitive barometers is actually looking at the Louis
17	Robbins diaries during this—during this period when
18	they are trying to come up with a new statement for
19	the Surgeon General’s Committee and they were hearing
20	from a variety of groups, both within the government
21	and outside the government. You know, I think it's
22	tempting from our point of view, because we know that
23	what happened with the Surgeon General's Report in
24	'64 and we know what’s happened since, to try to—to
25	try to put some—some early momentum into these—into
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 107
2	these—into the—into the late 1950’s. And I think
3	that that's a period—I think that does an injustice
4	to the period. I mean, I think this is a period
5	where there is really a raging debate, where—where
6	there are people, you know, who were putting forth
7	exciting science from experimental biology and
8	toxicology and epidemiology. There are other
9	scientists were saying, wait a minute, you know, we
10	have some problems here. I don't look at these
11	people, the people who are saying—looking at
12	problems as being bad guys in this. That's how
13	science works. I mean, there are people who pull out
14	an idea, another person criticize it, they make
15	improvements. I mean, I think Joseph Burkson is a
16	perfect example of that. He weighs statistical
17	objections and the material in the 1959 article that
18	you showed me a moment ago, the Cornfield article.
19	They take Burkson and they try to address all of
20	those points of view. I mean, and they did it. Not
21	because he was—they didn’t—they thought he was
22	ridiculous or anything. He was a major figure, he
23	raised some important objections, and they needed to
24	take those into—take those into account. When Louis
25	Robbins was heading the task force to write the
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 108
2	Surgeon General's statement in 1959 they asked
3	Burkson and it came—I think I've found references,
4	at least two, maybe three where they wanted him in
5	there to discuss it. When the Surgeon General's
6	advisory committee wrote its report in 1964 there's a
7	huge section in there on issues of causality and
8	statistics where they can use. And so, you know, the
9	thrust of your question is to take a sentence and try
10	to end this debate earlier than when it actually
11	ended. I mean, it was—to me it was a very lively
12	debate in the second half of the 1950’s. And that’s
13	the whole purpose of the Surgeon General's report,
14	was that, you know, as late as 1962 basically say, we
15	need to have a committee that can sort of sort
16	through this and make some recommendations.
17	Q. Well, by showing you the Colin White article were
18	there other people who held—are there other people
19	who held different views about the characterization
20	of the debate in the late 50’s and early 60’s?
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	A. There may be other—I mean, other people may indeed
23	hold those views, different views.
24	Q. And you talk about a raging debate. How did it stack
25	up on either side? You’ve mentioned Burkson and you
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 109
2	mentioned—
3	A. Well, you know, that's hard. It’s hard to do in
4	a—like a scale. I mean, 50 percent of the
5	physicians don’t believe in the early 60's. Is that
6	an equal? I mean, I don't know if that is or not.
7	You know—
8	Q. In the scientific community?
9	A. Scientific community, I think that there were real
10	doubts on that. I think that the—you can see
11	increasing data relating smoking and health
12	throughout the 50’s, sure.
13	Q. I'm sorry—
14	A. You can see increasing scientific studies and data,
15	you know, making these—the case of smoking as a
16	cause of lung cancer. You can see those increase
17	during the coursed of the 1950’s.
18	Q. And so who was on the counter side of the debate
19	aside from Burkson?
20	MR. NARKO: Objection.
21	A. Well, I think that—okay. Let's go back to the three
22	levels of evidence. I mean, I think Burkson and
23	Fisher are very important people in dealing with the
24	epidemiological data.
25	Q. I have a question for—
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 110
2	MR. NARKO: Objection.
3	A. But let me just say so you can see where my argument
4	is. From experimental biology the issue on
5	experimental biology was first of all—I think the
6	primary one was the failure of inhalation
7	experiments, the fact that skin painting experiments
8	have succeeded in some laboratories and not others.
9	So there was some—I mean, it was not a steady
10	progression. On the toxicological data people like
11	Wynder, who was one of the people who was finding
12	carcinogens in cigarette smoke was very clear to
13	point out that the amount of benzopyrine that he was
14	finding in cigarette smoke didn’t account for cancer.
15	I mean, there were major figures here that were
16	concerned that, you know, the science at that point
17	was not sufficient.
18	Q. Going—looking at the epidemiological studies in the
19	50’s and early 60’s were there any epidemiological
20	studies that did not point to an association between
21	smoking and lung cancer?
22	A. I think there were some, but not— not—now, most of
23	them, virtually all of them pointed to an association
24	between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.
25	Q. And how strongly did those studies--
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 111
2	A. Those associations were very strong. You know, of
3	course it took tools such as, you know, relative risk
4	to be evolved in the 1950's. Tools, for example,
5	that didn't exist earlier than that and were
6	developed largely in the context of smoking and
7	health. But there was, you know, ten times, for—for
8	heavy smokers even higher than that.
9	Q. I just want to find the quote in your report. Did
10	this raging debate that you described, did this end
11	with the publication of the 1964 Surgeon General
12	Report?
13	A. Nothing stops on a dime. However, I think the
14	Surgeon General’s Report in 1964 was a very important
15	document and a very important--the whole process was
16	an important one. It was a very public process. The
17	members of the committee were very prominent
18	physicians and scientists carefully chosen by the
19	Surgeon General. The formation of the committee we
20	know had—had—at least the idea of the committee had
21	some input even at the highest levels of government,
22	at President Kennedy's office. It was done very very
23	publicly. The media drum beat during the
24	deliberations of this committee is just phenomenal.
25	I have a—you know, just a whole thick section of
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 112
2	my—dealing with newspaper accounts and magazine
3	accounts like, you know, when are we going to have
4	this report and what’s going to be in it; you know,
5	what are the conclusions going to be leading up to
6	it? I think the people were very careful in the
7	report. They reviewed the 7,000 documents that I
8	mentioned and scientific studies. And so when they
9	reached their conclusion in January of 19641 think
10	it was a very important process scientifically. It
11	was important—I think in the history of epidemiology
12	it was very important. And I think that it became a
13	consensus statement at that point. Now, getting to
14	the heart of your question, did everything stop at
15	that moment? No. Of course it didn’t stop. I mean,
16	Congress had committee hearings the following year
17	and there were pathologists and epidemiologists who
18	came there and said they still didn’t believe it. I
19	had a pathology professor when I was a first year
20	medical student at Duke who accepted the public
21	health message. But as a pathologist he thought that
22	there were major questions. Things didn’t stop-
23	Q. But did the debate end?
24	A. I don't think—I mean, you know, I think that for
25	many aspects many questions remained open. Some of
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 113
2	them are open today about the issue there. But I
3	think the issue of—from a public health standpoint,
4	issues of causation and lung cancer, I think that
5	they didn't stop, but they became a consensus.
6	Consensus says to me that everyone agreed and the
7	people that don’t agree, that they are wrong and
8	horrible. I mean, what it means is that there was a
9	consensus, a body of opinion came together to discuss
10	a major public health problem, reached some
11	recommendations and that the recommendations are
12	widely promulgated and accepted. And I think that—I
13	think that’s what happened in the 19—one of the
14	things that happened in the Surgeon General's report
15	in 1964. Another thing that happened was that
16	criteria by which statistical and epidemiological
17	studies can be used in causation, those emerged.
18	And as far as I know those are the first time that
19	those are—are explicitly put together, you know, in
20	a statement.
21	Q. Talking about the five criteria, were those
22	immediately accepted by the scientific and medical
23	community when they were proposed in the '64 Surgeon
24	General's report?
25	A. You know, I can't—certainly they were—I think that
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 114
2	they were widely accepted as a means. I know they
3	were modified. I think Richard Doll wrote a paper
4	the next year. And as I remember, it was published
5	in 1965, and I think he had nine criteria rather than
6	five. I mean, I think that they're--you know,
7	they’re—but I think the idea of being able to make
8	judgements—and of course, I think that's the word in
9	the Surgeon General’s report used, to make
10	judgements—when you have—have statistical reports
11	making judgements for causation became possible and
12	accepted with the Surgeon General's report.
13	Q. You say "made possible." What was it about the
14	Surgeon General’s report that—you go from a period
15	where you describe this raging debate and questions
16	about the epidemiological—the ability of using
17	epidemiological studies to the Surgeon General’s
18	report which proposed five criteria to a general
19	acceptance in the scientific—or reaching a
20	consensus—I’m sorry—in the scientific and medical
21	community. I mean, that seems to me a pretty
22	dramatic transformation.
23	A. It is a dramatic transformation.
24	Q. And what was—what was it about the 1964 Surgeon
25	General's Report that was such a transforming—
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 115
2	A. I think the thoroughness. And then there's a
3	few—this is a—I think that the thoroughness, the
4	impartiality of the people in the group, the great
5	care that they took. But is, you know, that's a hard
6	question. I mean, there's not question in my mind
7	that it did occur. You know, part of it, you know,
8	has to do with just the dissemination of it. You
9	know, the Cancer Society I think sent out 300,000
10	copies of the Surgeon General’s Report. I mean, that
11	was just unheard of, that you would have degree of
12	dissemination. It was—I mean, look at the—how the
13	New York Times handled it. It was like the moon
14	landing. I mean, they had greater coverage than the
15	moon landing, on page after page after page, day
16	after day after day. The way it was covered in
17	"Time" and "News Week" and the "U.S. News" and
18	(inaudible), it was just—it was a—an event that I
19	think had—I think had a major impact. It’s hard to
20	find another scientific document that had that kind
21	of transforming effect in so short a period of time.
22	It really is a—I think it's a very important
23	document.
24	Q. Actually, that was one of my questions. Is there any
25	other statement or report that has similarly
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 116
2	transformed—
3	A. Health Report—it's hard to find one. I think,
4	although there is perhaps less media publicity to it,
5	I think when Surgeon General Koop sent a mailing
6	about the—about AIDS to every household in the late
7	80's. But that was another—other moment. I don’t
8	think it rose to the same level, because I don’t
9	think it was covered quite as—any where near as
10	extensively as the smoking and health. But I think
11	that's another—another point or a health document at
12	that...I think that most surgeon general's reports on
13	other diseases, you know, they don’t have a wide
14	readership.
15	Q. Not in everyone's library at home?
16	A. No.
17	MS. OLSEN: This might be a good—it's been 55
18	minutes. It might be a good time for a break for
19	lunch.
20	MS. KURTIN: Shall we break for lunch?
21	MR. NARKO: That’s fine.
22	YIDEOGRAPHER: Off the record at 12:25.
23	[Lunch Recess 12:25 p.m. - 1:20 p.m.]
24	Q. Dr. English, on page four of your report in the
25	second paragraph you quote an article by Robert
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 117
2	Streck, (inaudible) and Sidney Doloft. I'm sorry,
3	your report states, "When authors of the first
4	retrospective studies on smoking and lung cancer
5	address the question of association and cause they
6	clearly noted the difference." And then you go on to
7	quote this Streck article. I'd like to show you the
8	article.
9	[English Exhibit No. 13 Marked]
10	I'm handing you what's been marked Exhibit 13.
11	A. Uh-huh?
12	Q. Is this a copy of the article that you quote in
13	footnote 7?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. The quotation that you cite from that article sums
16	up, "At best the statistical evidence can provide
17	circumstantial evidence that a correlation is
18	biologically significant." Correct?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. On page 57 of Shreck's article in the summary and
21	conclusion section, after taking into account the
22	possible limitations of statistical evidence doesn't
23	Shreck conclude that "The positive correlation
24	between the incidence of cigarette smoking and the
25	incidence of cancer of the respiratory track appear
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 118
2	to be both statistically and biology significant"?
3	A. I see that sentence, but I—you know, I think in
4	reading the entire article what he is pointing out
5	and what I—the reason I included that is to bring
6	out that the epidemiologists and statisticians
7	believed in, you know, doing any kind of study in
8	this particular one, in cigarette smoking and lung
9	cancer is that—that these were associations. I
10	mean—but I think, you know, the quote I have is, you
11	know, definitely in the article as well.
12	Q. Then—I'm sorry—the—you said the reason why you
13	quoted it—
14	A. Is because the people who were performing these
15	retrospective studies, what they showed was that
16	there was an association, statistical association
17	between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. A
18	statistical association is not the same as saying
19	that one caused the other, and that's the reason I
20	put it in there, is that that distinction—that is
21	not only something I believe or people looking back
22	on it, these are—this was what researchers of the
23	time thought.
24	Q. Right. But this very researcher in 1950 did come to
25	the conclusion that it was biologically significant.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 119
2	Not—it was not just limited to a statistical—
3	A. Well, I don't think he's quite saying that. I mean,
4	I think, you know—you know, I stand by the way I
5	interpreted the article.
6	Q. And the way you interpret the article—
7	A. Is that he clearly recognized that what he had shown
8	was a statistical association.
9	Q. And I guess my question then is, did he reach any
10	other conclusions in this article?
11	A. That’s the main one that I—that I take from this
12	article.
13	Q. That’s the main one, but is that the only one?
14	A. That’s the only one I take from this article.
15	Q. At the bottom of page four you talk about John
16	Heller's testimony in 1953. And you state that "In
17	April of 1953 John R. Heller, Director of the
18	National Cancer Institute testified before a
19	committee of the House of Representatives that he did
20	not believe a causative link had been established."
21	Although he did not—you state he did not—well,
22	strike that. Did he reach any other opinions
23	concerning the links between smoking and lung cancer?
24	A. I don't—I don't recall. I mean, do you have
25	the—his newspaper—the New York Times article there?
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 120
2	[English Exhibit No. 14 Marked]
3	.
4	Q. I'm handing you an exhibit that's been marked Number
5	14. It’s a copy of a New York Times article dated
6	April 30, 1953. The title is "Cancer A Testifies."
7	The third full paragraph that states, "He conceded
8	that there is a very high correlation between heavy
9	cigarette smoking and the occurrence of lung cancer.
10	Do you see that?
11	A. "Dr. Harris said, lung cancer that increased several
12	fold." Is that correct?
13	Q. Yes.
14	A. "Among men in the past 25 to 30 years."
15	Q. He conceded—
16	A. And then the next paragraph says, "He conceded that
17	there is a very high correlation between heavy
18	cigarette smoking and the occurrence of lung cancer."
19	But he added, "Our scientists seem to feel that
20	there's some additional factors which we have not yet
21	discovered or studied sufficiently which may have a
22	bearing on this project."
23	Q. But by 1953 you would agree that the high correlation
24	had raised substantial concerns about the link
25	between—
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 121
2	A. I don’t know about substantial. I mean—I mean, the
3	lead sentence in the article—of course it’s Dr. John
4	R. Heller, Director of the National Cancer Institute,
5	says that, "Any connection between heavy smoking and
6	lung cancer has not been definitively established to
7	our satisfaction." I think—I mean, I think that's
8	for me the take home message of what he was saying.
9	Q. But the high correlation was definitely noted and
10	further investigations were underway into the issue
11	of linking cigarette smoking and lung cancer?
12	A. Well, I don't think the article quite says all the
13	further studies. I mean, there were further studies
14	going on and I’m sure Dr. Heller was well aware that
15	studies were going on.
16	Q. Did Dr. Heller ever agree that a consensus had been
17	reached on the issue of smoking and lung cancer that
18	you're aware?
19	A. I'm not aware of when—if he—if or whether he did.
20	Q. And then you go on to talk about your report. You
21	characterize it as " sentiments shared by E.
22	(inaudible) Hammond of the American Cancer Society."
23	And you cite to a New York Times article that I
24	believe we've—
25	A. I think we've already—
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 122
2	Q. We’ve already said that, or introduced that exhibit.
3	The end of that New York Times article, doesn’t
4	Hammond conclude that the leading possibility is
5	smoking, however?
6	A. I think we discussed that this morning. And you
7	know, the reason I brought this—that out was that I
8	think Dr. Hammond at this point, you know, thought
9	that there were four possibilities as the—as the
10	article suggested. His own study of—at the American
11	Cancer Society a few months later began to show that
12	cigarette smoking was—had become the leading
13	candidate in the association between cigarette
14	smoking—you know, between that and lung cancer. So
15	I think Hammond’s report—but I think at this moment
16	when he said that I think the whole purpose of his
17	statement there was that there were several causes.
18	Q. But—Fm sorry, you said the study that’s published
19	in 1954 leads to the conclusion that smoking is a
20	likely cause?
21	A. Well, a cause. Not cause, but it was—certainly that
22	was—I mean, the whole issue of causes, as we
23	discussed also this morning, which I don’t think
24	emerged until much later—but I think that—I think
25	there is a progression in Hammond’s thinking from in
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 123
2	the early 1950's, thinking of lung cancer as having
3	one of many possible causes, you know, causes, and
4	then moving to thinking cigarette is the primary risk
5	factor.
6	Q. But in the 1953 article he already states that the
7	leading possibility is smoking?
8	MR. NARKO: Objection.
9	A. I don’t think that’s what I—I mean, I think he lists
10	the four there as—and that’s what I take from this
11	article, from that—this newspaper report.
12	Q. Going back to Exhibit 8. So your take on it is in
13	1953 what he was saying is that there were still
14	four-
15	A. Yes. Dr. Hammond pointed out that smoking is one of
16	four factors that might be linked. I mean, I think
17	that and the earlier statement there, as again—once
18	again, this is a hard Xerox to read, but it also says
19	that, you know, they had not been statistically sure.
20	And you know, I—you know, I mean I—my—what I take
21	away from this newspaper report is that Hammond
22	thought that there was a variety of causes, possible
23	links to lung cancer. He thought it was important
24	enough to make those—to bring this into the public
25	discussion in 1953. And that's what I take from it.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 124
2	Q. And so his statement that the leading possibility is
3	smoking, however, is of no significance?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	A. I didn’t say that. I said this is what I take from
6	this particular newspaper article.
7	Q. Were there major studies done in the 1950’s on the
8	other potential culprits or links described?
9	A. Yes, there were. Looking especially at issues of air
10	pollution and the differences between urban settings
11	and rural settings there were other studies that were
12	done in the 1950’s.
13	Q. How many studies would you—
14	A. I can't—I don't recall the numbers of studies.
15	Q. Was there as many studies done on air pollution as
16	there were on smoking?
17	A. I don't know. I can’t quantify that for you. I
18	mean, some of the people who were doing work on
19	cigarette smoking were also doing air pollution
20	studies too. I mean, I’m thinking particularly of
21	Bradford Hill and Richard Doll in Great Britain, were
22	trying to sort out the differences between cigarette
23	smoking, urban, rural, air pollution, things like
24	that. I mean, so it’s not exactly that they were,
25	you know, again, stacking up on any kind of scale how
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 125
2	many people—the scientists were trying to sort out
3	this issue.
4	Q. But when you talk about potential culprits there is
5	the likely candidates versus the unlikely candidates,
6	I understand you need to sort out. But the emerging
7	consensus or—that's a loaded term—but the emerging
8	feeling from those studies were, was as much emphasis
9	being put into studying the other potential culprits?
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	A. It’s hard—it’s hard to—hard to sort out your answer
12	then. I think it’s fair to say over the course of
13	the 1950's cigarette smoking emerged from the pack as
14	being the most likely culprit. Doesn’t mean if the
15	others disappeared, or many people thought that there
16	might be a contributory fact—you know, from multiple
17	possibilities. And of course some of these were
18	associations. I think we both have made the mistake
19	of slipping in the word cause when that’s not really
20	what—certainly what I mean.
21	Q. I'm sorry. So your reference-
22	A. I think—I was just saying that I think that the two
23	of us have used the word cause perhaps in not quite
24	the way I want to use it in this discussion, because
25	I really think the issue of cause was something that
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 126
2	happened in the 1964 Surgeon General’s report.
3	Q. And once we get to the 1964 Surgeon General's report
4	is it fair to use the word cause?
5	A. For lung cancer, yes. I think so.
6	Q. On page 5 you state that "Respected epidemiologists
7	and statisticians such as Joseph Bergsen of the Mayo
8	Clinic raised serious substantive methodological and
9	interpretive objections to those who claim that
10	smoking caused lung cancer. I believe we did speak
11	about this a little bit this morning. But in
12	addition to Bergsen, and I believe you also mentioned
13	Fisher, who were the major—the leading scientists
14	during that time raising the serious substantive,
15	methodological, and interpretive objections.
16	A. Those are the main ones.
17	Q. Besides Bergsen and Fisher were there others?
18	A. There were others. I can't recall their names at the
19	point. But these are the ones that I think made
20	the—made the most substantial objections.
21	Q. And to use a term that you used earlier this morning,
22	the raging debate on this issue—except it's not
23	quite a balancing—but Bergsen and Fisher on one
24	side, the emerging evidence on the other. What else
25	is—
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 127
2	A.	Bergsen and Fisher were talking about the
3	epidemiological evidence.
4	Q.	Okay.
5	A.	There were other people talking about the other lines
6	of evidence that were incomplete.
7	Q.	Okay.
8	A.	In other words, as I—maybe I didn’t make clear—in
9	the skin painting experiments there were some people
10	who were able to replicate what Wynder and others
11	were doing. There were others who were unable to
12	replicate. There were issues of—in fact they exist
13	today—of not being able to produce a lung cancer in
14	laboratory animals with inhalation experiments. And
15	so their people were saying, well, you can’t
16	really—you can’t really make a causal statement or
17	any statement here, because the biological evidence
18	is simply not sufficient. So that’s part of it. And
19	the same thing is true, the toxicological evidence
20	was that there were after 1955 a number of
21	carcinogens, which at least animal skin that were
22	debated. But people pointed out, well, first of all,
23	these are animal carcinogens dealing with skin. We
24	haven't found anywhere near enough in a cigarette to
25	account for all of this. The toxicological evidence
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 128
2	doesn't add up. And so there’s the debate. I mean,
3	there are levels of—there are levels of evidence
4	there. Once of Bergsen's complaints was not entirely
5	statistical. He was saying that it was his sense
6	that epidemiological evidence had to have biological
7	backup, had to have biological evidence before you
8	could—you could take it a final step. Now, you
9	know, what eventually occurred, you know, with the
10	Surgeon General’s report was they said, Well, you
11	know, it is possible to make a causal statement using
12	epidemiological data, judgements—you can make
13	judgements maybe without this other kind of
14	information. But Bergsen was of the belief that
15	biological data simply had to exist. So the
16	debate—the debate is—is—I think is happening on
17	many levels, covered widely in the press, and you
18	know, in a variety of, you know, different sciences.
19	Q. And going to the experimental biology component that
20	you described can you name some leading scientists
21	who were questioning the validity of the study?
22	A. A name that comes to mind is a British researcher by
23	the name of Passey P-a-s-s-e-y. There are others
24	that don’t come to mind. But if—but in reading this
25	literature in the 1950's there were many researchers
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 129
2	who simply couldn't produce the skin tumors that
3	Wynder did. I think by the time of the Surgeon
4	General’s first or second report, I can’t remember
5	which one, in 1957 or ’59—1 think there were five
6	researchers who had been able to do that. I think by
7	the time of the Surgeon General's report there were
8	additional ones. But the fact was, it wasn't at—for
9	example, Wynder did this in 1953. It wasn't a subtle
10	issue from skin painting, even that small component
11	in 1953 there was a continuing, you know, give and
12	take of science, being able to—and of course the
13	issue of inhalation experiments, none of the people
14	who performed the inhalation experiments were
15	successful.
16	Q. Were any successful prior to the 1964 Surgeon
17	General's report?
18	A. Inhalation experiments? Not that I’in aware of.
19	Q. And did that impede the ability of the Surgeon
20	General's advisory committee to formulate its—
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	—opinion?
23	A. This—I mean, I can—I mean, I noted that in the
24	report. I think it probably gave him cause. I don’t
25	know that, because I--you know. But I think that
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 130
2	that’s a very important missing link, I think, is the
3	inhalation experiments. And—but I think one of the
4	things that the Surgeon General's report did was
5	that, you know, it gave criteria that you could—that
6	with judgement it was possible to use epidemiological
7	reports to make causal statements.
8	Q. Do you know how many attempts there were to replicate
9	the skin painting experiments that failed?
10	A. There are many. I can't give you a number.
11	Q. More than five?
12	A. Oh, definitely more than five.
13	Q. Any more than 10?
14	A. Could be more than 10. I mean-
15	Q. More than 50?
16	A. --some of the issues we can get as the explicity of
17	the science is it depended which experimental animals
18	you used. Some strains of mice were susceptible to
19	skin painting tumors and some weren't. It depended
20	on the type of tar that you were using. For example,
21	there was a long time in the New York area that only
22	Wynder could produce these tumors. He had produced
23	his tar in a particular way, and so people said,
24	okay, we can’t do it in the tar we’re producing, just
25	to give you an idea. I think it required—I think it
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 131
2	was like 200 cartons of cigarettes to produce the tar
3	that he would--so it was an enormous number of
4	cigarettes. And he was able to do it as people
5	producing tar in other laboratories didn't. And
6	there’s some correspondence back and forth, you know,
7	we weren’t—couldn't do it on our own, but we asked
8	Wynder for his tar and then we were able to do it.
9	So I think it had to do with the strain of mice, the
10	quality of the tar. Had to do with how long. Wynder
11	painted his three times a week, week after week,
12	month after month. Didn’t see any for 10 months or
13	so. Other people had trouble finding it in 10
14	months, but maybe they found it in 17 months. I
15	mean, it's—it was a complicated situation. I think
16	that there were lots of studies that were
17	unsuccessful or different, reaching slightly
18	different conclusions. Another big one was, were
19	these warts or skin tumors, were they cancers?
20	Because many of them were simply roughened areas of
21	skin. What do you count as a true cancer? There was
22	a debate about that. It’s very complex if you get
23	into the reading of the specific studies on this. It
24	wasn't that Wynder published in 1953 and then
25	everyone thought that it was—everything that needed
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 132
2	to be done was done.
3	Q. But there were studies that were able to reach
4	similar conclusions?
5	A. Yes. Yes. This was replicated. Not—yes. The skin
6	painted was replicated, sure, over time.
7	Q. And moving to the component, the toxicological area.
8	Who were the leading scientists opposing or raising
9	concerns in the toxicology?
10	A. Give me a minute to explain what the issues are, if
11	that's okay. Tobacco tar is not one subject. It's a
12	complex mixture. In the 1950’s it was thought that
13	there were several hundred components to it and we
14	now know that there are thousands, four or five
15	thousand. It was a very difficult task of organic
16	chemistry in the 1950’s to sort out what chemicals
17	were actually in the mixture. And because some of
18	these chemicals were—existed in such very very tiny
19	amounts the problem came as—came up for the organic
20	chemist is how can you prove that a given suspected
21	substance is actually there. And I think this is
22	where one in a series of debates came up. The idea
23	is, you know, it was—the traditional way in organic
24	chemistry was to try to sort out so you have
25	individual elements in this very complex mixture.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 133
2	And then to do things like molecular weights and
3	(inaudible) points to actually determine what the
4	identity of the chemical actually is. It wasn't
5	enough material to do that for most of the components
6	of the mixture. So they used a variety of indirect
7	methods. There was chromatography. There was
8	various spectastrophy. There were several different
9	methods. And the issue that came up in organic
10	chemistry is how many of these indirect methods was
11	necessary before you could claim that a substance
12	actually was in a complex mixture like this. And so
13	in 1959 standards were proposed by—I think the
14	authors' names were Plemmer and Johnstone. These
15	were adopted by the—and mentioned in the Surgeon
16	General's report, that essentially we needed three of
17	these indirect methods. And so some of the
18	controversy dealing with the toxicological studies
19	would be someone would propose that a chemical
20	existed in cigarette smoke, but he would only have
21	identified it with one method. And some people would
22	say, no, I can’t do it. And so there was this back
23	and forth. So part of the controversy was in dealing
24	with the complexity of sorting out what’s actually in
25	tar. So that's one, and that's not a small one,
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 134
2	because it really—I’ve done—I did some of these as
3	an undergraduate. You know, one of these separation
4	studies can take a summer. Another area was, okay,
5	they would identify the substance which was an animal
6	carcinogen as it turned out, one of the
7	polycyclihydrocarbons like Benzopyrine. But the
8	issue was, is there enough that it makes—that it’s
9	significant or is it too little. And that was one of
10	the things that Wynder brought out, there was just
11	not enough of it to account for what was happening on
12	the skins of animals. A third point was, all right,
13	it's an animal skin carcinogen. Does that make it a
14	human lung carcinogen? Because it's well known that
15	things can be a carcinogen for different animals and
16	species and tissues in different ways. And so it's a
17	very complex, process. And there was a lot of debate
18	back and forth. If you go into the organic chemistry
19	journals you can see it.
20	Q. And when was the Plemmer and Johnstone articles?
21	A. I believe it was probably either in ’59 or '59,1
22	think '59.
23	Q. And that article proposed using three methods?
24	A. The two or three methods, yes.
25	Q. And you say that was cited by the Surgeon General's
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 135
2	report?
3	A. Uh-huh. I can find it if you have that.
4	Q. Was there a debate on—I’m sorry, strike that. Was
5	there a controversy over even the conclusion using
6	two to three methods being sufficient?
7	A. I'm not aware that there was. I think that was a
8	generally accepted method.
9	Q. And generally accepted by what timeframe?
10	A. Well, certainly that's what the Surgeon General—that
11	was the standard that it mentioned in 1964.
12	Q. '64. When the article was first published in 1958 or
13	'59 was that widely accepted at the time?
14	A. I can't—I don't recall. And I don't recall any—as
15	I sit here I can’t recall anyone who raised an
16	objection to that standard, but beyond that I can't
17	go.
18	Q. Dr. English, do you consider yourself an expert in
19	epidemiology?
20	A. Well, certainly I—you know, I studied epidemiology
21	in medical school, I read epidemiology as part of my
22	practice, and I, you know, do a lot of historical
23	epidemiology. If by expert you mean do I perform
24	epidemiological, conduct them, I don't conduct them,
25	but I feel very comfortable in interpreting them.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 136
2	Q. Have you ever published an epidemiological study?
3	A. Well, I've been published in historical epidemiology
4	in the sense of my book on rheumatic fever. I also,
5	you know, dealt with the patterns of disease in
6	dealing with dyptheria, pneumonia. But again, have I
7	done a primary epidemiological paper, no. But I do
8	feel very comfortable in reading and interpreting
9	them.
10	Q. Would you consider yourself an expert in experimental
11	biology?
12	A. Well, again, I certainly studied a lot of
13	experimental biology in undergraduate school as a
14	chemistry major. I did some of these extraction
15	studies of course in medical school. And I read
16	extensively in experimental biology and I read in the
17	history of experimental biology. At this point in my
18	career I don’t go to the lab and do experimental
19	biology studies, but I do consider myself to have
20	expertise in that area.
21	Q. Have you performed your own experimental biological
22	studies?
23	A. Not since undergraduate school.
24	Q. And have you published any?
25	A. No, I have not.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 137
2	Q. Do you consider yourself an expert in toxicology?
3	A. Again, I have read, you know, studied that
4	extensively, pediatricians in toxicology. And that's
5	really an intricate part of my medical education, my
6	practice in pediatrics. I’ve read—I mean I've—a
7	lot in the history of toxicology. So I feel I have
8	expertise there, yes.
9	Q. And what exactly—just to pin down a definition, what
10	exactly is the study of toxicology?
11	A. A study of poisons.
12	Q. And have you conducted toxicological experiments?
13	A. Myself in a laboratory, no.
14	Q. And have you published any toxicological studies or
15	reports?
16	A. I have done on the history of toxicology. I have a
17	book on the history of childhood lead poisoning.
18	Q. But again, this is a historical account?
19	A. Yes, uh-huh.
20	Q. Going to page 5 again of your report, in the second
21	paragraph. Do you see that in the late 1950's and
22	early 1960's epidemiologists recognized and studied
23	Bergsen's critique, and then in responding to Bergsen
24	forged new criteria for establishing a causation
25	announced in the surgeon general's report. My
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 138
2	question on this is in the preparation of the surgeon
3	general's report were there only epidemiologists
4	involved in the formation of those criteria?
5	A. I'm a little confused with your question.
6	Q. I guess I’m confused by how you’ve set up your—you
7	state that epidemiologists recognized and studied
8	Bergsen's critique.
9	A. Uh-huh.
10	Q. And then in responding to Berg sen’s critique, the
11	epidemiologists responding to Bergsen?
12	A. Yes. That's right. That’s what I meant.
13	Q. Okay.
14	A. I think in the article, the Cornfield article that
15	you showed me earlier this morning, a sizeable part
16	of that article was taking Bergsen’s objections,
17	responding to Bergsen’s objections. In the surgeon
18	general's report you can see further discussion where
19	Bergsen's objections are—I mean, you know, there’s a
20	very large section in the beginning of the surgeon
21	general's report where the whole issue of how you
22	make causal statements with statistics in—excuse me.
23	And Bergsen figures prominently, his arguments figure
24	prominently in that discussion.
25	Q. I guess just going back to the construction of how
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 139
2	you portrayed it in—how you state it in your report,
3	"epidemiologists recognized and studied Bergsen's
4	critique and in responding to Bergsen forged new
5	criteria for establishing causation announced in the
6	surgeon general's report." So the epidemiologists
7	were the ones who forged the new criteria for
8	establishing causation?
9	A. In part. I mean, I think that the—of the 10 people
10	on the advisory committee that came up with the
11	causation, I believe there are one or two
12	epidemiologists and statisticians on that. So I
13	think—if I'm understanding your question the people
14	came up with a criteria, the people who wrote that
15	report. And so there are—and there are some
16	statisticians on there.
17	Q. Well, that’s my question. The way this is drafted
18	it—you have epidemiologists responding to a critique
19	that's outstanding. And are those the same people
20	who forged the new criteria in establishing—
21	A. No, I don’t think so. Because the people who were
22	among the epidemiological circles were not on the
23	surgeon general’s report. I think that people who
24	wrote those criteria and came up with those criteria
25	were aware of the debate and took that into
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 140
2	consideration.
3	Q. So the people who came up with this—the criteria for
4	the surgeon general's report responded to what had
5	been going on previously?
6	A. I think that's a good way of saying it.
7	Q. Okay. And once the 1964 Surgeon General Report was
8	released did all epidemiologists agree with the new
9	criteria announced?
10	A. I know that there was a continuing debate. I mean,
11	again on the Congressional hearings that were done in
12	1965, there was an epidemiologist by the name of
13	Brownlee who said—
14	Q. I'm sorry, who?
15	A. Brownlee B-r-o-w-n-l-e-e, who stated that he had
16	concerns about it. I’ve never looked in any
17	systematic fashion to see how the epidemiological
18	community in general received those criteria. But
19	again, for a consensus, that doesn’t mean that
20	everything stops. I mean, you know—so I would
21	suspect that there would be debate afterwards.
22	Q. But the debate if you imagine a continuum, their
23	moving along the continuum you reach a certain point
24	where there is consensus doesn't mean unanimity.
25	A. Right.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 141
2	Q. How long was there serious debate or differing
3	opinions about the epidemiological criteria
4	announced?
5	MR. NARKO: Objection.
6	A. I can't really answer that question. I haven't
7	studied it specifically.
8	Q. But you would say that there was no longer a raging
9	debate-
10	A. I think that's fair, right. I think that the method
11	and the conclusions were accepted.
12	Q. We had talked about this morning—about another
13	example of a report, a health report receiving not
14	much notoriety. In my mind you have—moving the
15	continuum to a new level with this one report, is
16	there anything similar that you can think about that
17	so dramatically changed those thoughts?
18	MR. NARKO: Objection.
19	A. No. As I sit there I can't think of another report
20	quite like the Surgeon General's Report in 1964 in
21	that fashion.
22	Q. And would you—I'm sorry if—I didn't want to miss
23	speak. But would you categorize that as a turning
24	point, the publication of the 1964 Surgeon General's
25	Report?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 142
2	A. In a number of ways it was. The idea of causation of
3	lung cancer, not that all the scientific studies were
4	done, but as far as the public health community
5	reaching a conclusion, I think it was, you know, a
6	major very critical turning point. But other things
7	are not as—the turning point isn’t quite the same.
8	The issues in organic chemistry, trying to figure out
9	what’s in tobacco, tar. That didn’t change much at
10	all, I think, by the Surgeon General's Report. In
11	other words, there has been a study, you know,
12	elucidation over the decades of what’s in cigarette
13	smoke, what's not in cigarette smoke. The issue of
14	the failure of inhalation experiments, that has been
15	a continuing challenge. That didn’t really change
16	with the Surgeon General's Report in any particular
17	way. I mean, there are lots of things that didn't
18	change. But I think that the public health consensus
19	on causation, I think that that did change.
20	Q. Earlier you had talked about—we'll call it the
21	raging debate for shorthand—had the many different
22	areas, epidemiology, experimental biology, and
23	toxicology. What you just said is that it didn’t
24	necessarily—wasn’t necessarily a turning point in
25	some other areas such as experimental biology, but
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 143
2	the inhalation experiments, and toxicology with the
3	organic chemistry in the components?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. So did this turning point really come about just in
6	the area of epidemiology?
7	A. Not so much in the epidemiology. I mean, the studies
8	continued. I mean, there were no changes in the way
9	epidemiological studies took place.
10	Q. Okay.
11	A. I think where the turning point was, was in the
12	interpretation of that.
13	Q. Okay. And you said the public health community
14	reached a consensus-
15	A. Uh-huh.
16	Q. —with the 1964 Surgeon General's Report. Did the
17	scientific community reach a consensus as well?
18	A. I think it’s mostly the public health community that
19	reached a consensus.
20	Q. And how about the medical community?
21	A. Well, the medical community, especially in the years
22	after the surgeon general’s report, there are some,
23	you know, polls of physicians who relatively
24	quickly—I mean that—Louis Robbins—relatively
25	quickly changed. Louis Robbins mentioned that it was
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 144
2	his impression that at least 50 percent of American
3	physicians as late as 1962 did not accept. There are
4	opinion polls of physicians that took place after the
5	Surgeon General's Report in 1964 and those show that
6	American physicians rapidly changed. And they
7	changed not only in their stated beliefs, but you
8	know, a large percentage of American physicians
9	smoked too, before the—you know, in the 50's and
10	60’s, and that the number of smoking physicians
11	dramatically decreased after the Surgeon General's
12	Report, actually well in excess of the numbers of
13	Americans who were stopping smoking.
14	Q. You say that a number—a number of physicians smoked
15	prior to the publication of the 1964 Surgeon
16	General's Report. You had said that 1962 Robbins
17	quoted 50 percent of physicians were still debating?
18	A. Uh-huh.
19	Q. Is that the link between smoking and lung cancer?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Could the fact that a large number of physicians were
22	smokers at the time have contributed to their
23	conclusions about the smoking and lung cancer-
24	A. You know, it’s hard to say how an individual
25	physician—you know, I’m sure it had to do with his
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 145
2	personal experiences, his patients, what he learned
3	in medical school. It's hard to say how an
4	individual physician made up her mind or his mind on
5	that.
6	Q. Could it have been a contributing factor?
7	A. It could—
8	MR. NARKO: Objection.
9	Anything is possible.
10	Q. In footnote 11, going back to the statement in your
11	expert report, in other words, this give and take was
12	a constructive process—let's go off the record.
13	[Off-the-Record Discussion 2:00 p.m. - 2:04 p.m.]
14	Q. Just as we went off the record we were looking at the
15	statement footnote 11 cites to an article by J.P.
16	Vanderbrook?
17	A. Uh-huh.
18	Q. Review and commentary (inaudible). Are you aware of
19	criticisms and in particular something I looked at
20	was a letter to the editor by Sandra Greenland. Are
21	you familiar with that name at all?
22	A. What year?
23	Q. I think it’s 1989 or 1990, responding to the
24	Vanderbrook article.
25	A. No.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 146
2	Q. No. Okay. Well, then, just talking about the
3	general concept, looking back historically for the
4	critics in the smoking and health debate, Bergsen and
5	Fisher, there is one interpretation that it was the
6	wrong perspective. The issue was not whether the
7	available data proved that smoking caused lung
8	cancer, but whether the available data warranted
9	action. In going back to the debates in the public
10	health community and in the medical profession the
11	give and take that you described in the constructive
12	process and leading to the 1964 Surgeon General’s
13	report, were the critics taking into account the
14	potential impact of failure to act if the issue is
15	the health of a patient?
16	MR. NARKO: Objection.
17	A. The first part of that, I don't know whether you were
18	citing from this letter that I haven't read in part
19	of the question.
20	Q. It’s a general concept-
21	A. So it's hard for me to make a comment directly about
22	that particular letter, because I haven't read it.
23	The question is what should the public health
24	community do. I know when Leroy Burney, after his
25	first statement in 1957 was asked in Congress when he
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 147
2	gave testimony in Congress was asked, you know, well,
3	what do the American people know; I mean, what should
4	you be doing, what should we be doing? And his
5	response was that because of the tremendous press
6	coverage, because that the Surgeon General’s office,
7	Public Health Service had informed personal
8	physicians--’cause that's where most people got—most
9	patients got their medical education he thought that
10	they were doing that and they had carried it to that
11	particular—the level he thought was appropriate at
12	that point. So I think in some ways he was grappling
13	with that issue. That was also Louis Robbins’ job.
14	I mean, he was the cancer control person. He was the
15	cancer educator for the Federal Government, and his
16	office was. And you know, the article that—the one
17	that you showed me this morning from Minnesota
18	Medicine in 1962 is essentially the message that his
19	office was taking to American physicians largely and
20	the American public. So I think they were grappling
21	with the issue of what—in the period for which there
22	wasn't—you know, where the science and epidemiology
23	and the toxicology and the experimental biology, when
24	there wasn't enough information out there what they
25	should be telling the American public.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 148
2	Q. In reviewing Louis Robbins’ daily logs what did he
3	believe needed to be done from the public health
4	community's perspective?
5	MR. NARKO: Objection.
6	A. From his point of view I think it was quite clear
7	that he thought the way—the key was to—was to
8	educate physicians. And he was—he thought that that
9	was the best way to influence behavior and concern
10	was to get—was to get physicians, because he thought
11	that that’s where most public health information was
12	actually conveyed. At least a big portion of it.
13	Q. And did that continue after the release of the 1964
14	Surgeon General’s Report?
15	A. I think after the release—you know, the Surgeon
16	General's Report in addition to making some
17	statements that it was a public health problem of
18	significant import that required remedial action, I
19	think there was a whole new ball game after that as
20	far as the public awareness after that. And it
21	really went beyond just trying to educate physicians
22	at that point. It was trying to educate, you know,
23	educate in even greater extent the American people.
24	I don't want to suggest that they thought they were
25	going to stop educating physicians at that point.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 149
2	Certainly that was not the case. But the point was
3	that they were going to—they were going to, you
4	know, make it a public health campaign. And it's
5	really, you know, as Dr. Koop had concluded in the
6	'89 Surgeon General’s Report, really it was on
7	parallel to the American history.
8	Q. Bringing that—I know you discuss that later in your
9	report. In 1989 when Surgeon General Koop made that
10	statement what was the smoking rate in the country at
11	that time?
12	A. I think 32 percent of American adults, I think. I
13	mean, I'd have to look at a table, but it seemed to
14	me that it had fallen somewhere from the mid to high
15	40’s down to somewhere around 32.
16	Q. Now, I know you've quoted what Surgeon General Koop’s
17	statement was, but do you think that 1/3 of the
18	population smoking is a successful campaign?
19	MR. NARKO: Objection.
20	A. Well, I—a couple of things. One of course is that
21	Dr. Koop was a very sensitive observer and he thought
22	it was. The fact that half the smokers who had ever
23	started—had ever smoked had stopped is another
24	measure of the success. What were Americans smoking
25	in 1989? It was a much different cigarette than they
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 150
2	had been smoking in 1952, ’51, '52, ’53 when these
3	health concerns first came available. There was
4	almost universal knowledge of the dangers of smoking
5	by 1989. I mean, I think that it’s a remarkable
6	campaign, both from a historian looking at it in
7	2002, it was remarkable that the public health people
8	in 1989.
9	Q. When you talk about universal knowledge, is there a
10	difference between knowledge and action on a person’s
11	part; you can know that something is bad for you and
12	you do it anyway?
13	MR. NARKO: Objection.
14	A. Sure. I mean, I think that there is a--you know,
15	there are people who make decisions based on a lot of
16	things. But I want to go back to the universal
17	knowledge. I mean, certainly by the 1980’s well into
18	90 percent of the people, which is, you know—knew
19	the dangers of smoking and health, knew that smoking
20	killed. I mean, those are extraordinary numbers.
21	Q. Did they do the polls—poll how an individual
22	appreciated the risk to oneself?
23	A. Yes. And this was a concern that—I mean, one of the
24	things about looking—and I've looked at polls and
25	very extensively, looked at the Gallop Organization
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 151
2	polls from the 1940's on. I’ve looked at a number of
3	other organizations, some of the ones conducted by
4	the Federal Government. Polling science also changed
5	in that 50 year period, the Gallop Organization being
6	of course the premier polling organization of the
7	country. And one of the issues that arose in here
8	is, okay, yes. We all say that cigarette smoking is
9	dangerous. Is it dangerous to me; did smokers
10	personalize the risks? And beginning in the 1970's
11	the Gallop Organization began asking that question,
12	and Americans did. I mean, in very high numbers.
13	Not quite as high as—the general belief numbers was
14	a little bit lower than that. But there was this
15	very high percentage beginning in 1977 and a steady
16	rise thereafter. And those numbers are also in the
17	'89 Surgeon General's Report. But the recognition
18	of, you know, do polls capture personal—you know,
19	personal risk, beliefs in personal risk, that's
20	something that poll organizations understood and
21	began asking questions about.
22	Q. So despite this public health campaign and this high
23	knowledge of awareness that you say—still 1/3 or
24	nearly 1/3 on the population continued to engage in a
25	habit that they knew was dangerous to their health?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 152
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And you consider that a successful public health
4	campaign?
5	MR. NARKO: Objection.
6	A. Again, looking at the perspective both as a historian
7	in 2002 and looking at it as Koop did when he made
8	that judgement in 1989, given the change in public
9	behavior is truly remarkable. Now, he was also
10	frustrated. I mean, I think every surgeon general
11	from 1965 when they began making comparison
12	statistics of smoking behavior, comparing to the
13	level of smoking in 1964 I think every surgeon
14	general has been frustrated that, you know, didn’t
15	stop, you know, even given all the information. And
16	I think that's where the story of trying to engineer
17	a safer product comes in.
18	Q. Do you consider yourself an expert in poll taking?
19	A. Certainly I have education on how to interpret polls
20	as part of my graduate school education. It's
21	something I do a lot in my teaching, how I teach
22	undergraduate students and graduate students. And
23	I've used polls in my historical research. I have
24	participated in a few very small scale polls of Duke
25	faculty on various—I've been on various faculty
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 153
2	committees that have polled the faculty on various
3	things. I don’t really—I mean, gives me some idea
4	of a flavor of what’s involved in constructing a
5	poll. But if you mean by expert do I conduct the
6	polls, I don’t do that. But I really consider myself
7	able to interpret polls.
8	Q. Have you published any articles about polls—
9	A. No.
10	Q. —interpreting? At the end of page five you state
11	that "A fully satisfying demonstration from the
12	experimental laboratory faced many obstacles and
13	remained largely unsolved at the point of issuing the
14	1964 Surgeon General’s Report." Just to clarify,
15	what would a—what is a fully satisfying
16	demonstration in your mind?
17	A. Well, the—the obstacles I’ve already talked about,
18	and in the various sciences. You know, certainly I
19	think successful inhalation experiments would have
20	been a step in that direction. Certainly a better
21	understanding of all the components within tobacco
22	tar would have been another step in that direction.
23	Q. And at this point in time to your knowledge has there
24	ever been a fully satisfying demonstration in the
25	experimental biology field?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 154
2	A. Certainly the issue of inhalation experiments, to my
3	understanding, that there have not been successful
4	inhalation experiments.
5	Q. And how about—
6	A. You know, another aspect that was not done in 1964
7	is, so here's this carcinogen; how does that
8	carcinogen actually transform a cell into a malignant
9	one. That was certainly not one that was known in
10	'64. I think those are still issues that are
11	outstanding.
12	Q. And although there are still issues outstanding has
13	that hindered the ability to determine whether
14	something causes lung cancer?
15	A. Well, certainly the public health community made that
16	determination based on the evidence that it had in
17	1964.
18	Q. So although it still—does it still remain largely
19	unsolved now?
20	A. In some of the areas that I've mentioned it has been,
21	you know, unsolved. I mean, there—just to give you
22	an idea of what I mean by unsolved, maybe in a
23	grossly quantitative measure. There were 7,000
24	studies that the Surgeon General’s—scientific
25	studies the Surgeon General's Reports had looked at.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 155
2	If you look again in the Medline search between 1966,
3	which is after the Surgeon General’s Report through
4	2002, there are 50 or 60,000. But each—many—most
5	of those represent, you know, scientific inquiry.
6	Most of those don't particularly or directly deal
7	with the issue of causation. But those are
8	scientific—you know, scientific questions that
9	people are asking, there were lots. And I think
10	sometimes we think that the—everything stopped with
11	the Surgeon General’s Report. I mean, scientists
12	have been very busy on aspects of this—of the issue
13	of cigarette smoking and health, very active since
14	1964.
15	Q. And have they reached any new conclusions since 1964
16	with respect to smoking and lung cancer?
17	A. Well, the they, I mean, that’s a hard—that's a hard
18	thing, you know—you know, has the public health
19	community ever wavered in its conclusion that
20	cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer, no. The
21	public health community has never wavered in that.
22	MS. KURTIN: Let's take a break to change the tape.
23	[Recess 2:21 p.m. - 2:32 p.m.]
24	Q. Dr. English, just speaking a little further about the
25	skin painting tests. Recognizing that there are some
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 156
2	limitations to the use of the test—to the use of
3	such tests in extrapolating smoking and lung cancer
4	(inaudible) what are the benefits or why would such
5	tests be used in formulating opinions about smoking
6	and lung cancer?
7	A. Well, historically they were used first of all to
8	determine was there a substance in cigarette smoke
9	that produced tumors or cancers. Was there any—was
10	there anything at all. Because when these first
11	associations came up there wasn’t much biology, this
12	was a chance to try to put some biological foundation
13	into some of those early statistical reports. And so
14	that was one way it was used. And traditionally, you
15	know, animal studies are, you know, one way that
16	researchers start when dealing with issues of human
17	disease. But I think in many respects one of the
18	ways that the scientific community used skin painting
19	experiments is actually the reverse. In 1957, for
20	example, Wynder said, okay, I’ll take the cigarette
21	tar which I in my lab have been fairly successful in
22	producing skin tumors, and reduce concentration of
23	tar to the point where I don’t get skin tumors, to
24	the idea of the (inaudible) is there a way to begin
25	to modify cigarette tar in such a way that it would
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 157
2	be safer. And so I think in that particular way that
3	both skin painting and, as I say, the reverse skin
4	painting, I think they both have been helpful in sort
5	of the history of this—of the science of this.
6	Q. But taking that example of experiments to see if
7	there’s a way to make the cigarette tar safer, would
8	those experiments be subject to the same limitations?
9	A. Absolutely.
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	A Yes. Absolutely. And Wynder and everyone realized
12	that, that what people were doing was reducing the
13	properties of cigarette tar so that it no longer
14	produced skin tumors in laboratory animals.
15	Q. And therefore it wasn’t a definitive experiment to
16	show that this was—
17	A. No. There were limitations. There were limitations.
18	And I think that the science of low tar cigarettes
19	actually took--took—there are several components of
20	that too. And tar painting is one of them.
21	Q. Turn to page six of your report, and the discussion
22	about benzopyrine. Is that how you pronounce it?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Dr. English, do you know when the tobacco industry
25	first discovered the presence of benzopyrine in
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 158
2	tobacco?
3	A. I haven’t studied the tobacco industry scientific
4	laboratories, so I don’t have a knowledge of that. I
5	mean, I—where I have seen documents are only those
6	that have been produced by plaintiff witnesses.
7	Q. So have you seen any documents concerning
8	benzopyrine, the discovery of it?
9	A. The closest would be one—I think it would be Allen
10	Rodgeinan's paper in 1956. And actually that—yes.
11	That would be the closest. We'd have to look at the
12	paper for me to make a comment on it.
13	Q. But by 1954 it was available in the scientific
14	literature that benzopyrine had been discovered?
15	A. Well, it had been—there was—in 1954 there was the
16	first study, which is considered to be definitive
17	that benzopyrine was in tobacco tar. I think shortly
18	thereafter many laboratories around the world, many
19	in Europe, a few others in the United States had
20	determined that—that benzopyrine was in cigarette
21	tar.
22	Q. And is this going back to what you earlier described
23	about the different methodologies to identify a
24	particular component-
25	MR. NARKO: Objection.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 159
2	A. Benzopyrine actually emerged I think because there
3	was more benzopyrine that—it’s not—it doesn't occur
4	in quite the trace amounts that others that—it
5	actually was pretty definitively known that it
6	existed earlier than the Johnstone Plemmer—Pleinmer
7	and Johnstone article, which was in 1959, that
8	benzopyrine existed in sort of large enough amounts
9	that it was possible to make a definitive
10	determination, which was not the case in some of the
11	other ones.
12	Q. So that same controversy about trying to identify a
13	trace substance?
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	A. You know, by the time 10 laboratories had discovered
16	benzopyrine I don't there was much controversy. I
17	think that most people thought it appeared in tobacco
18	tar. And just to be absolutely clear, there are
19	several benzopyrines here. There is 1-2 benzopyrine,
20	there's 3-4 benzopyrine, there are others depending
21	on the exact chemical molecule we’re dealing with.
22	So we can just—I mean, even the benzopyrine story is
23	complicated.
24	Q. Of the different types of benzopyrine which have been
25	identified in tobacco tar?
1	Dr.	English	Direct	Page 160
2	A.	3-4 and 1-2 I believe.
3	Q.	And were they discovered at different times?
4	A.	Yes.
5	Q.	Do you remember which was discovered first?
6	A.	I believe 3-4 was first, but I’d have to review that
7	more carefully for you.
8	Q.	I'm going to the top of page 7 of your report. I
9	think we have talked a lot about that today, but you
10	state, "What might seem obvious from the vantage of
11	the turn of the 21 st century in fact took serious
12	sorting out. I will describe the significance
13	ascribed to these many studies by physicians and
14	scientists as well as by scientific and public health
15	organizations and the controversy about the
16	relationship between smoking and lung cancer that
17	continued at least until 1964." Are there additional
18	significant studies that you will describe that we
19	haven't covered this morning?
20	MR. NARKO: Objection.
21	Q	Well, let me step back. When you say, "I will
22	describe the significance ascribed to these many
23	studies" what do you mean by that statement, "I will
24	describe" ?
25	A.	Well, some of that we've already done this morning.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 161
2	We’ve talked—I mean, and this afternoon—we've
3	talked about the various types of studies. And I’ve
4	tried to give you what I think are the significance
5	of those studies. I suppose I could be asked about
6	additional studies, you know, either by you or by
7	other people and I would try to place those in
8	historical context too.
9	Q. Okay. So then, my question is, are there other
10	significant studies that we did not discuss today?
11	MR. NARKO: Objection.
12	A. There are many many many studies. The 7,000 that the
13	surgeon general, you know, did, you know, I'd be
14	willing to discuss any of them, you know, that you
15	want to discuss or any of the other attorneys wish to
16	discuss.
17	Q. If you are called to testify at trial—well, my first
18	question—strike that—is, have you ever testified on
19	this particular area before?
20	MR. NARKO: Objection.
21	A. Which area?
22	Q. This last concluding paragraph, the significance
23	ascribed to these many studies by physicians and
24	scientists.
25	A. Well, in the period—the state of the art of—before
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 162
2	1964 there was a component of my testimony in the
3	Blue Cross case.
4	Q. Okay. So in your testimony, in your trial testimony
5	in the Blue Cross Blue Shield case did you testify
6	about other significant studies that we did not cover
7	this morning; do you recall?
8	A. I don’t recall.
9	Q. In your prior trial testimony in the Blue Cross Blue
10	Shield case did you use any demonstratives or
11	prepared exhibits?
12	A. I did.
13	Q. And did you prepare those exhibits yourself?
14	A. I had them prepared. I didn’t actually, you know,
15	put the line graphs or—I mean, actually physically
16	scan the pages in. But I directed them to be done I
17	guess is the fair way of putting that.
18	Q. In organizing your testimony did you decide what
19	components to discuss about the issue or was that a
20	collaborative effort?
21	MR. NARKO: Objection.
22	A. It was a collaborative effort in the sense that I had
23	done a lot of work on the public health community's
24	overwhelming response and media campaign and
25	educational campaign. Which examples are the best
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 163
2	examples given for that particular case was a
3	collaborative one, which one of my examples to pick
4	out. I mean, it was a case that was taking place in
5	New York state. So for example, many of the examples
6	that we used came from New York state.
7	Q. And are you talking about the public health community
8	response or the period of time leading up to the
9	1964-
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	A. I'm talking about the—specifically the answer there,
12	I'm trying to respond to your question there on how I
13	selected the demonstratives. Is that right?
14	Q. Uh-huh.
15	A. And I gave you the example of the public health
16	community.
17	Q. Okay.
18	A. The demonstratives for this particular segment of my
19	testimony I don’t remember well enough to even make a
20	comment.
21	Q. In addition to the epidemiological studies, the
22	experimental biology studies and the toxicology
23	studies were there other studies or articles that
24	were informative in the preparation of the 1964
25	Surgeon General Report—other areas, I'm sorry, that
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 164
2	were informative in the preparation of the 1964
3	report?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	A. Well, I think there are lots. These are three
6	important ones that I listed, but there are others.
7	Q. And what would some of the most important—
8	A. One area are some of the pathological studies that
9	were done, particularly those done by Oscar Auerbach.
10	Q. And with respect to the pathological studies you
11	talked about controversy or different opinions with
12	respect to those areas. In the pathological area was
13	there a similar debate?
14	A. Uh-huh. Yes, there was.
15	Q. And can you please elaborate?
16	A. Uh-huh. There were—now, what Dr. Auerbach’s
17	studies—very painstaking studies did was doing
18	multiple microscopic sections of the airways of
19	Veterans Administration patients who died of lung
20	cancer and other diseases and describing the
21	microscopic changes that he saw under the—you know,
22	when he did that. He thought in a series of papers
23	that began in the mid 50's and going up through the
24	late 50's early 60’s that he could see a progression
25	in the irritation of the airway that went from—that
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 165
2	went to something he called carcinoma in situ, which
3	was sort of a pre-cancerous state. And he thought
4	that those levels of information were more prominent
5	in cigarette smokers than people who had died from
6	other causes. The controversy in the background was
7	that there was—there were some—unlike the skin
8	painting experiments where there are a lot of people
9	trying to do it, because of the very painstaking
10	nature, I mean, he did one study 20,000 slides,
11	another study I think maybe as many as 40,000—there
12	weren’t a lot of people actually in this discussion.
13	But there was a physician from Great Britain who
14	didn't see those changes.
15	Q. And who was that?
16	A. I can't remember the name off of—from my
17	recollection here. But there were—so there were
18	some people who just didn't—at least one person who
19	wasn't able to replicate. But there were other
20	issues where the controversy is. In the earlier
21	stages of the information the hypoplasia, what you
22	call hypoplasia, metaplasia, these changes occur in
23	bad lung infections, influenza, in other diseases
24	other than lung cancer. And so the idea is that
25	these changes were due specifically to lung cancer.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 166
2	That was an issue that people brought up. The second
3	was this small group of cells that he labeled
4	carcinoma insitu, there was a real discussion debate
5	that Auerbach himself recognized, was that there was
6	no sense or proof that these pockets actually became
7	malignant and became lung cancer. In other words,
8	they were very angry cells, pre-cancerous perhaps,
9	but the idea of that final step of the transformation
10	of these pre-cancerous cells to cancerous ones was
11	something that Outback recognized. And in fact, he
12	has a paper in 1964 where he--you know, he basically
13	calls it a hypothesis. And there are other issues,
14	ones that—how exactly he counted these cells and all
15	that led him in 1961 in the journal—in one of the
16	medical journals that basically go back from scratch
17	and redo his studies, because there had been some
18	controversy on how he had classified things. So with
19	Auerbach, I mean, I think it’s a smaller piece of
20	this story, but there were controversies even about
21	his studies.
22	Q. In addition to the pathological studies you just
23	described were there any other major areas that the
24	1964 Surgeon General’s Advisory Committee drew upon?
25	A. I think those are the major ones that I can recall
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 167
2	this afternoon.
3	Q. Moving to sub-topic C, Federal Government Involvement
4	in the Debate. When you state that Dr. Leroy Burney
5	was fully informed of a controversy surrounding
6	smoking and disease what leads you to the conclusion
7	that Dr. Burney was "fully informed"?
8	A. He said he was.
9	Q. So that's his—his description of—
10	A. Yes. I mean in his—both in the statement and then
11	in his testimony in front of Congress, you know, he
12	was—you know, he said he was informed, that he was
13	on top of this situation. You know, he certainly
14	assembled scientists to go before Congress. I mean,
15	he—I think he was very well informed.
16	Q. From a historical perspective-
17	A. And to give you another idea, you know, just to
18	follow the story through, I mean, when he decided
19	shortly after he issued his first report that he
20	wanted a second he set up a--you know, a task force
21	in—with Louis Robbins as the head. The task force
22	kept the surgeon general fully informed of this
23	discussion that was occurring within the Cancer
24	Control Program. You know, I think he was—I think
25	he was very well informed.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 168
2	Q. But going back to the characterization of being fully
3	informed you are relying upon his own assessment?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	A. His assessment and also, you know, my
6	characterization of what was going on in the Cancer
7	Control Program, what his testimony and the testimony
8	of others from the government were in 1957.
9	Q. So just to go back, he was fully informed about the
10	controversy while recognizing that there was what you
11	quote in his next statement, "There was a lot
12	unknown"?
13	MR. NARKO: Objection.
14	A. Uh-huh. I think so, yes.
15	Q. In talking about the task force that was assembled in
16	1958 you state that, "This task force, which
17	consisted of scientists from several departments and
18	agencies of the Federal Government gathered together
19	leaders from the scientific, medical, and public
20	health communities, as well as leaders from the
21	tobacco industry." Dr. English, who from the tobacco
22	industry was involved in this task force?
23	A. The tobacco industry was not a member of the task
24	force. What I meant there was they gathered together
25	the task force, which was members from the Federal
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 169
2	Government called in to discuss with them members
3	from outside scientific agencies. They called in
4	from the public health groups such as the Heart
5	Association, the Cancer Society, and they called
6	members of the tobacco community.
7	Q. Who in particular, if you recall, was called in?
8	A. I don’t recall. But they had several meetings with
9	members of the tobacco industry.
10	Q. Going back to something we discussed earlier this
11	morning, you would not characterize however members
12	of the tobacco industry as part of the public health
13	community?
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	A. I don't, no. Except in the particular—you know, in
16	some of the collaborative work that they did
17	this—that I mentioned this morning.
18	Q. So then, in this instance what—what contributions
19	would the leaders of the tobacco industry—well,
20	strike that. What—why were leaders of the tobacco
21	industry then called upon by members of this task
22	force?
23	A. I don't know precisely the reasons. I can’t get
24	inside of Louis Robbins' head of why they were
25	invited in. I suspect that they were invited in
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 170
2	because they were knowledgeable about cigarettes. I
3	suspect that they were—Louis Robbins thought that
4	they would have opinions that he believed the group
5	should hear. I know at one particular point they
6	were discussing the issue of actually whether the
7	Federal Government should begin tar and nicotine
8	ratings of its own.
9	Just to back up a step, tar and nicotine ratings
10	had been done in the 1950’s. Sometimes they were
11	done by independent groups like the Readers Digest or
12	Consumers Union. Sometimes they were done, you know,
13	by one of the tobacco organizations or another, and
14	they thought that perhaps they needed to have a
15	uniform measurement—you know, what eventually came
16	about, you know, in 1966 and '61.
17	I remember the details of that particular
18	meeting, when they called this in was, you know, what
19	do we consider a standard cigarette, you know, how
20	many puffs? Everyone smokes differently. What the
21	butt length of a cigarette—I mean, there was lots of
22	things that they were—technical things that they
23	were asking. Because the tobacco industry had some
24	expertise in measuring tar and nicotine, Louis
25	Robbins and his group were asking questions about
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 171
2	methods and things like that. I mean, they weren't
3	being asked necessarily for public health types of
4	decisions. I think they were asked largely for
5	technical reasons.
6	Q. But they were being asked technical questions by
7	members of the public health community to inform—
8	A. Aspects—I'm sorry, go ahead. I interrupted you.
9	Q. They were being asked by members of the public health
10	community technical questions to inform the public
11	health community about the state of knowledge about
12	smoking and health issues?
13	A. In a broad sense. They usually were asked more
14	specific questions sort of like how would you
15	measure—you know, what should a standardized
16	measurement look like, something more like that, at
17	least in these particular two meetings that I
18	remember, from 1958 and '59.
19	Q. So you recall two meetings where members of the—
20	A. I can recall two while I’m sitting here. There may
21	have been more.
22	Q. And do you know how many members of the tobacco
23	industry were involved in these meetings?
24	A. No. But Louis Robbins always stated he was present.
25	He was very good about that. So that's a knowable
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 172
2	question.
3	Q. So your information about this—about these meetings
4	comes from Louis Robbins—
5	A. Only from his—from his diary.
6	Q. And since in this instance the public health
7	community invited members of the industry to these
8	meetings and asked them these technical questions do
9	you think it’s important what the industry was
10	telling—do you think it’s important what the
11	industry was telling the public about its products at
12	that time?
13	MR. NARKO: Objection.
14	A. They’re not really related, I don't think. I mean,
15	the—I mean, you know, I haven’t—I haven't made any
16	kind of systematic study of what the industry was
17	telling, you know, the American public. So it's hard
18	for me to make a characterization on that. But it
19	seems to me that the kinds of technical information
20	that at least I have seen in those two meetings that
21	I can recall this afternoon is not something that the
22	public would be terribly interested in knowing or
23	needed to know.
24	Q. But it did assist the public health community?
25	A. Well, I think eventually it helped. I think it
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 173
2	can—as I recall, that the—what became known as the
3	Cambridge method and the parameters of the Cambridge
4	method such as number of puffs per minute and
5	the—the duration of the puff and length of—and how
6	many CCs were in a puff, I think some of those look
7	like they've built upon the meetings that took place
8	in Louis Robbins’ office in the late 50’s.
9	Q. And then talking about the Cambridge method and
10	measuring puffs. Ultimately did that have an impact
11	upon—
12	A. Well, the Cambridge method did. But I think
13	you—what I’m trying to say is that there are certain
14	levels of conversations. I think that this one here
15	is, you know, how do we structure our cigarette
16	machine to measure tar and nicotine levels. That's a
17	highly specific and technical aspect there, which is
18	not the kind of thing, for example, that the Surgeon
19	General Burney included either in the '57 or the '59
20	report, or for that matter, even in the '64 report.
21	I mean, there are different kinds, different pieces
22	of information.
23	Q. But it was important to have participation by the
24	tobacco industry on such matters?
25	MR. NARKO: Objection.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 174
2	A. Well, I think Louis Robbins felt the need to do that.
3	Q. And then going to your statement, "In November 1959
4	after over 40 drafts the task force delivered its
5	report to Surgeon General Bumey who cleared its
6	conclusions with the Secretary of Health, Education
7	and Welfare and with officials in the Eisenhower
8	White House." Where do you get your support for the
9	40 drafts, clearing it with the Secretary of HEW and
10	officials in the Eisenhower White House?
11	A. From the frustration of Louis Robbins also in his
12	diary. The committee worked on his report. They
13	thought they had a good draft. They circulated it to
14	various--so many members inside the government. The
15	government people would raise objections, they’d go
16	back and make changes. When they finally thought
17	that they had a good report they went to the surgeon
18	general, they went to the head of the NCI. They got
19	sent back changes. And then when everything was done
20	they sent it to the White House. But this is all
21	based on his—all based on his diary.
22	Q. And in these 40 drafts does—do Louis Robbins daily
23	logs discuss if there were substantive changes in the
24	report throughout its various incarnations?
25	A. In some cases he does, in some cases he doesn't.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 175
2	Q. Do you have an example of what might have changed?
3	A. You know, I can’t sit here specifically and remember,
4	you know, what changes were made at which particular
5	stage of the drafting of the document.
6	Q. Was the ultimate conclusion ever changed? And by the
7	conclusion I'm referring to what you cite, "the
8	weight of evidence at present implicates smoking as
9	the principal ideological factor in the increased
10	incidence of lung cancer."
11	A. I don't think that was—I'm not sure at what point in
12	the drafts that actually emerged as one of the
13	conclusions. But I don’t think—I know that there
14	was very strong opinion within Louis Robbins’ staff
15	that that conclusion was too strong. And I think
16	that—that’s what led to a member of his staff
17	drafting an editorial that was published in the
18	Journal of the American Medical Association a couple
19	of weeks later.
20	Q. What was Louis Robbins' opinion about the ultimate
21	conclusion?
22	A. Oh, I think he—oh, I think he—from what I can read
23	from his diary I think he personally agreed with this
24	conclusion.
25	Q. And you say—can you tell me more about the member of
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 176
2	his staff drafting a statement?
3	MR. NARKO: Objection.
4	A. I can't tell you who. But one of the things that
5	happened in the—about two weeks after this was
6	published there was an editorial in the Journal of
7	American Medical Association signed by the editor,
8	which criticized aspects of the report saying
9	essentially that no prominent scientist agree and
10	disagreed, which is actually a fair reading of my
11	looking at the—Louis Robbins’ diary, that there were
12	people coming in who disagreed with the comments. I
13	found drafts of that letter in Louis Robbins' file.
14	In other words, you know, even commented, you know,
15	that this was—so you know, so it's very clear that a
16	member of—member or members—it’s not clear who—of
17	his staff actually drafted what appeared in the
18	Journal of the American Medical Association two weeks
19	later.
20	Q. Could the drafts of the letter have been sent from
21	someone else and made its way into Louis Robbins’
22	file?
23	MR. NARKO: Objection.
24	A. My recollection of his diary was that he thought it
25	came from within, inside the Public Health Service or
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 177
2	the National Cancer Institute.
3	Q. He thought—what led him to believe that it came from
4	within?
5	A. Because it—again, this is my recollection, is that
6	these were drafts that were circulating within the
7	department.
8	Q. So within Louis Robbins’ files there were drafts of
9	this editorial which appeared that he believed was
10	drafted by members of his own staff?
11	A. I'm not sure he characterized it as strongly as that.
12	But they appear—they appear in his file. And I
13	believe he makes comments like that.
14	Q. Did you do any research—and I’m sorry, which journal
15	did it appear in?
16	A. Journal of the American Medical Association.
17	Q. Did you do any research in the Journal of American
18	Medical Association to find out-
19	A. I did not.
20	Q. So you have no first-hand knowledge about how the
21	editorial appeared in the j oumal?
22	MR. NARKO: Objection.
23	A. I'm not sure what you mean.
24	Q. Well, you found the draft of this in his files, but
25	you didn't do any independent research contacting the
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 178
2	journal to find out where they received the editorial
3	from?
4	A. No, I did not.
5	Q. Turning to briefly the section on the Surgeon
6	General’s Report on Smoking and Health 1964. I
7	believe we have spoken about this this morning and
8	this afternoon. Going over the circumstances
9	surrounding the creation of the Surgeon General's
10	Advisory Committee what research did you conduct in
11	this area?
12	MR. NARKO: Objection.
13	A. Well, first of all, I read what the Surgeon General
14	himself said about the creation of the report, both
15	in news conferences and in articles that appeared
16	before, and then also you know, in the Surgeon
17	General's Report itself.
18	Q. Anything additional?
19	A. Well, there's a lot of commentary, you know, in the
20	media in and around the time of the creation of the
21	report.
22	[English Exhibit No. 15 Marked]
23	Q. Dr. English, I’m handing you what's been marked as
24	Exhibit 15. It's entitled "Smoking and Health Report
25	of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 179
2	the Public Health Service." While this is not the
3	full Surgeon General’s Report is this the 1964
4	Surgeon General's Report that we have been speaking
5	about?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. (Inaudible)?
8	MR. NARKO: Objection.
9	Q. Can you tell me—I believe it's the first
10	(inaudible). It lists the members of the Surgeon
11	General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health.
12	How were the members of this committee decided upon?
13	A. They were prominent members of the medical and
14	scientific community who had not publicly had an
15	opinion on the issue of the relationship between
16	cigarette smoking and lung cancer and other diseases.
17	Q. And did the tobacco industry have veto power over the
18	members?
19	A. I think that—whether it was veto power or not I
20	think that they had some input in the Surgeon
21	General's decision on who was going to be a member of
22	this body. I mean, I think—the impression I get
23	from reading various accounts is that the surgeon
24	general thought long and hard about who should be on
25	this committee. He wanted people who would be very
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 180
2	well respected and so that their conclusions would be
3	heard without the sense that someone who had been a
4	partisan. I think that was probably a wise decision
5	given the amount of debate and controversy that had
6	preceded this.
7	Q. Are you aware if the tobacco industry was able to
8	submit comments to the Surgeon General Advisory
9	Committee, comments or articles or materials for the
10	formulation of their report?
11	A. Yes, I am aware of that. The tobacco industry
12	submitted a tremendous amount of material, volumes.
13	I have read some of their submissions.
14	Q. And what did their submissions deal with?
15	A. Lots and lots of things. Some of them were five
16	volumes long teeming with all sorts of aspects. We’d
17	have to look at them for me to tell them, but lots to
18	do with the chemistry of tobacco, lots to do with
19	just the whole range of issues. But there was—there
20	were an enormous amount of material that was
21	submitted. Submitted and cited by the way, too. The
22	Surgeon General cited the material.
23	Q. Was material submitted by the Tobacco Industry
24	Research Council, T1RC?
25	A. I don't know whether they had a submission or not.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 181
2	By 1964 of course a sizeable number of research
3	projects conducted by the individual researchers
4	there had been published, and so some of those were
5	cited, I believe. But whether the TIRC made a formal
6	presentation or submission, I don’t know.
7	Q. And you talked this morning about the five criteria
8	which were announced or presented; is that the
9	correct terminology?
10	A. Yes. Discussed.
11	Q. Discussed. And I think I asked the question earlier,
12	it was not just epidemiologists who made up the
13	committee; is that correct?
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	A. These 10 members?
16	Q. Uh-huh?
17	A. No. No. These are not epidemiologists. These are
18	prominent physicians, medical leaders, scientists.
19	Q. But this is the committee list on this identified as
20	Roman Numeral III.
21	A. Uh-huh.
22	Q. These—this committee is who developed the five
23	criteria?
24	A. Well, they eventually--they're the ones who wrote the
25	report.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 182
2	Q. They wrote the report. Okay. Going through your
3	report you state, "Using this new standard of
4	causation the Advisory Committee determined that the
5	evidence was sufficient to conclude that 'cigarette
6	smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men.1"
7	Then you also state, "The same standard did not find
8	a causative link between smoking and lung cancer in
9	women or between smoking and coronary artery
10	disease." My question is, what was the 1964 Surgeon
11	General Report’s opinion with respect to smoking and
12	lung cancer in women?
13	A. The evidence was pointing in the same direction. You
14	know, I think they were being very careful with these
15	new sets of criteria. You know, they didn’t have the
16	same amount of evidence for women smokers as they had
17	for male smokers. I think the anticipation was that
18	when the data were in that cigarette smoking would
19	be—you know, would be a cause of lung cancer in
20	women. And indeed, in two years—three years later
21	the 1967 Surgeon General’s Report did indeed reach
22	that conclusion.
23	Q. Once again you anticipated my next question. Was
24	the—did the Surgeon General ever change its opinion.
25	Prior to the issuance of the 1967 Surgeon General’s
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 183
2	Report was there a controversy on the issue of
3	whether smoking caused lung cancer in women?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	A. Controversy—
6	Q. I'm sorry, 1964, from the time of the 1964 Surgeon
7	General’s Report to the time of the 1967 Surgeon
8	General’s Report.
9	MR. NARKO: Objection.
10	A. Controversy among whom?
11	Q. Smoking and lung cancer in women.
12	A. Lung cancer, women—controversy among whom?
13	Q. The scientific community.
14	A. I think that the scientific community and public
15	health community all thought that when the data were
16	in—I shouldn’t say—I can't speak for everyone. But
17	I think everyone thought that when the data were in
18	that women would be found to—would fall in the same
19	category as men.
20	Q. And how about in the medical community?
21	A. I think that again you can—nothing is uniform, but I
22	think that—no one was surprised when this was found
23	out for women a few years later.
24	Q. So the issue for the studies concerning women was the
25	sufficiency of the data at that point, not—
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 184
2	A. Yes. The sufficiency of the data, women just took up
3	the habit of cigarette smoking later than men. The
4	datas weren't as round. To give you an example, you
5	know, when the surgeon—when cigarette warnings were
6	added to packets of cigarettes they didn't say
7	cigarette smoke may be harmful to men. I mean, they,
8	you know, they—the implication was it was harmful to
9	everybody.
10	Q. Did the 1964 Surgeon General's Report come to a
11	conclusion about smoking and—a link between smoking
12	heart disease?
13	A. I mean, it’s certainly reported on the evidence
14	that—the statistical associations between the
15	increase in cigarette—in heart disease and cigarette
16	smokers. Heart disease is a much more complicated
17	issue in that there are seven or eight independent
18	risk factors. And to determine that cigarette
19	smoking was an independent risk factor actually
20	took—was more than the Surgeon General's Report
21	could make in 1964. That took the development of
22	additional mathematical tools and the conclusion
23	wasn't reached until the late 1970's.
24	Q. Was there ever a Surgeon General’s Report that
25	addressed the issue of smoking and heart disease?
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 185
2	A. There was, and I forget exactly which year. But my
3	recollection is that the surgeon general—surgeon
4	general made the conclusion that heart disease was
5	a—cigarette smoking was an independent risk factor
6	in heart disease, I believe in 1980.
7	Q. Was there a controversy in the scientific and medical
8	communities concerning the issue of whether smoking
9	was an independent risk factor in heart disease prior
10	to the Surgeon General’s Report that you described?
11	MR. NARKO: Objection.
12	A. Prior to 1980?
13	Q. 1980.
14	A. Yes. It had to do with the—it has to do with the
15	multiple risk factor, because it goes back to the
16	complication of determining an independent risk
17	factor as a cause when there are so many risk
18	factors. There’s high blood pressure, obesity,
19	sedentary life style, diabetes, stress, cigarette
20	smoke. There are a lot of things that fit into that.
21	And how to desegregate that was a complicated
22	process. And so there was a lot of controversy
23	involved in whether—exactly what role cigarettes
24	played. I think people thought that there was a
25	contribution, exactly how it was going to play out
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 186
2	was not known. Even the American Heart Association,
3	of course, who was intimately involved in this I
4	don’t believe made a determination until 1978 or
5	1979.
6	Q. But the controversy was over whether it was an
7	independent factor, not whether it was a contributing
8	factor?
9	MR. NARKO: Objection.
10	A. I'm not sure I know the difference between those two.
11	But there was—I think it's fair to say that there
12	had been a statistical association. The statistical
13	association was not as high as the one with lung
14	cancer. And the question was how to interpret all of
15	that. I mean, there was considerable controversy
16	about that.
17	Q. But by 1980 was the controversy—was there still a
18	viable controversy at that time?
19	MR. NARKO: Objection.
20	A. Yes. It’s—the heart disease decision is different
21	than the lung cancer one in the sense that it—you
22	know, it's a little hard to actually pin it down,
23	because I believe the Heart Association says they
24	determined it in one year, the surgeon general
25	says—then relies upon the Heart Association and it
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 187
2	made its determination. And then surprisingly enough
3	the following year the Heart Association says, we're
4	basing our recommendation on the Surgeon General's
5	Report. And so it’s not as—it’s not as clear cut.
6	But certainly by the early 1980's it had been an
7	independent risk factor. And you know, I think it
8	was a—you know, a consensus. It was not as—I think
9	as dramatic as the one in 1964 on lung cancer.
10	Q. Was there any controversy remaining by the 1990's?
11	A. You know, I can't really say about that. I mean, was
12	there any controversy? I'm sure there must be.
13	Q. Was there a lack of consensus by then?
14	A. No. I think there was a consensus about this, you
15	know, in the early 1980's. The consensus doesn’t
16	mean there’s no controversy.
17	Q. Right. Consensus doesn't mean that everyone agrees.
18	A. That’s right.
19	Q. In the 1964 Surgeon General’s Report did the surgeon
20	general offer an opinion about chronic obstructive
21	pulmonary disease?
22	A. My recollection—might even have to refresh it here,
23	was that he thought it was associated with cigarette
24	smoking. I don’t remember whether—go ahead. I'm
25	sorry.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 188
2	Q. By chronic obstructive pulmonary disease what in
3	particular does that refer to; that does not
4	include—does that include bronchitis and emphysema
5	or are those separate?
6	A. Well, this is where it gets complicated in other
7	respiratory illnesses other than lung cancer.
8	Because the definition of emphysema is in chronic
9	obstructive lung disease, pulmonary disease, that
10	changes somewhat over this period also. I think the
11	surgeon general believed in 1964 that certainly cough
12	bronchitis were related, as I remember, did not make
13	a statement on emphysema, a causal statement on
14	emphysema.
15	Q. And I’m not trying to play a memory game with you. I
16	believe on page 38, is that where the surgeon general
17	talks about chronic bronchitis and—
18	A. I think it’s one of several spots. And a statement I
19	remember is, "The relationship exists between
20	pulmonary emphysema and cigarette smoking, but it has
21	not been established that the relationship is
22	causal."
23	Q. And in general the 1964 Surgeon General's Report did
24	believe that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of
25	sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 189
2	action; is that correct?
3	A. Yes. That’s—you quoted it correctly.
4	Q. Going back to that first sentence of your—under
5	Subsection D you state that you will "Discuss
6	subsequent Surgeon General Reports published almost
7	every year since 1964."
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Were—did any of the subsequent Surgeon General
10	Reports have the same impact of the 1964 Surgeon
11	General Report?
12	A. Well, the issuance of each of the Surgeon General’s
13	Reports I think was important. And it laid—you
14	know, and lots of—lots of press coverage on them.
15	There are some I think that stand out higher than
16	the—than the others.
17	Q. (Inaudible.)
18	A. Sure. I think that the 1981 Surgeon General's Report
19	when the whole issue of the low yield recommendation
20	was rethought is a very important one. I think that
21	the 1986 report dealing with environmental tobacco
22	smoke is an important one. I think the ’88 one
23	dealing with addiction is an important one. I think
24	that the—there are a couple of review ones I think
25	which are very important in sort of saying where we
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 190
2	are in a given moment. I think the '79, which was
3	the 15th anniversary is a very important one for a
4	number of reasons we could come back to. The ’89 is
5	a very detailed one dealing with—it’s a good
6	historical document dealing with, you know, all that
7	has happened—that had happened in the smoking and
8	health story, especially from a public health
9	standpoint in the 25 years since then. But there are
10	others. There was a—the character of surgeon
11	general's reports changed with Surgeon General Koop
12	in that they became to be rather than general views
13	of what's happening in the whole field to specific
14	topics. And so if you were interested particularly
15	in what was happening in cigarette smoking in the
16	developing countries in Latin America I guess you’d
17	go—is it 1990 or 1992. If you were interested in
18	what was happening in—especially with youth you'd
19	turn to 1994. If you’re looking what’s happening in
20	minority groups, I guess that’s the ’98. There are
21	different reports that you would turn to for
22	particular reasons.
23	Q. And you have reviewed each Surgeon General's Report?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. In addition to the surgeon general reports were there
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 191
2	other publications or series put out dealing with
3	public health reports, systematic public health
4	reports? And my example are the monograph series.
5	A. Yes. The monograph series, I have read some of
6	those.
7	Q. And I’m sorry, when I mentioned the monograph series,
8	those are documents published by the National Cancer
9	Institute?
10	A. NCI, yes.
11	Q. Cancer Institute. And are those considered important
12	to public health?
13	A. They are, sure.
14	Q. And which monographs have you read?
15	A. They have different numbering systems. The first one
16	I read was I think in the old numbering system 28,
17	which dealt with—I might even have that—the name of
18	it here. Anyway, it came out in 1968 and it dealt
19	with Towards a Less Hazard—a Less Harmful Cigarette
20	was the title of the NCI sponsored conference, which
21	the monograph of the same name came out. The NCI
22	monograph series I think sponsored some of the
23	publications of the world conference on smoking and
24	health, especially the one that took place in 1975.
25	I've read in the new nomenclature system 6,1
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 192
2	believe, which dealt with a review of the FTC method
3	that was published in 1996.
4	Q. Is that—and again, it’s not a memory game. But is
5	that monograph 7?
6	A. Could be 7.
7	Q. I'm not trying to test you on—
8	A. No. That’s fine.
9	Q. —the titles.
10	A. And then I've read the current, monograph 13.
11	Q. And that one is on; what’s the topic of monograph 13?
12	A. It reviews the issue of public health recommendations
13	on low yield cigarettes.
14	Q. Did any of the surgeon general reports discuss
15	addiction?
16	A. Yes. Surgeon generals'reports have discussed
17	addiction. '64 did, '79, and '88 are the major
18	reports on addiction.
19	Q. And have the surgeon generals’ opinion about
20	addiction changed over time?
21	A. Yes, it has.
22	Q. And can you describe the evolution of the surgeon
23	generals’ opinion about addiction?
24	A. Uh-huh. Well, cigarettes have always been—people
25	have always known cigarettes are hard to quit.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 193
2	Cigarette smoking is hard to quit. I mean, I think
3	that the phrase "little white slavers" I think sort
4	of captures that. And they're certainly—in the
5	popular, you know, magazines and newspaper reports
6	that I've read, there’s very frequently—in fact,
7	I've never seen anyone say that cigarette smoking is
8	easy to quit. I mean, there was a general view that
9	cigarette smoking, and occasionally even in the
10	popular literature the word "addiction" would be
11	used. And so I think it's not surprising that with
12	considering the whole issue of cigarette smoking that
13	the Surgeon General’s Advisory Committee in 1964
14	reviewed the issue. I think it's in Chapter 13. And
15	you know, in every year what was known, it was known
16	that nicotine had physiological properties. It
17	certainly reviewed that smoking was hard to quit.
18	And then it turned to—what they were trying to do
19	was to say, was this particular behavior, cigarette
20	smoking, was it—did it meet the criteria of
21	addiction? And so what the Surgeon General’s
22	Committee did was turn to the world health
23	organization, which was one of the standard--had one
24	of the standard definitions of addiction. And in
25	looking at the Surgeon General’s—world health
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 194
2	organization's definition of addiction concluded that
3	most cigarette smoking most closely fit the
4	definition of a habit. You know, sort of like coffee
5	drinking. And for a number of reasons I think the
6	Surgeon General's Committee did that. And for
7	example, there was the thought that an addicting
8	substance had to lead to intoxication. And I mean,
9	everyone knows that someone who has had too much to
10	drink or someone, you know—someone who’s had an
11	overdose of heroin or something like that, that they
12	can’t function. But people can smoke cigarettes and
13	be—and function quite well. So the level of
14	intoxication, it didn’t fit that. Notions of
15	addiction in the 1950’s and 60's had as a component
16	to it antisocial behavior. You know, the drunk that
17	wasn't productive in society, the heroin addict, and
18	cigarette smokers were productive. Another issue was
19	withdrawal. In the 1950's and 1960's withdrawal
20	meant DTs if somebody was going through a narcotic
21	withdrawal. And everyone knew that people who
22	stopped smoking had a certain edginess to them, but
23	the Surgeon General’s Committee didn't think that the
24	edginess that led to withdrawal—that the edginess
25	fit the criteria of withdrawal that was then known.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 195
2	So there was a variety of reasons why the
3	Surgeon General's Committee decided that it was—that
4	smoking was not an addiction in 1964. Now, what they
5	didn't deny was that nicotine was the substance that
6	people had identified, that nicotine had
7	physiological effects. In fact, I think that's their
8	term, that nicotine had physiological effects. And
9	they never—Surgeon General’s Report said even though
10	we're not calling this an addiction they never said
11	it was easy to quit. But they did say it was not an
12	addiction. You know, when the surgeon general picked
13	up the story again in 1979 with the complexity of the
14	issue there had been a lot of research that had been
15	done. And in the'79 Surgeon General’s Report, as I
16	read through it, there were two camps that were of
17	scientists who were discussing the issue in the '79
18	report. One was that cigarette smoking was basically
19	a nicotine—almost like a nicotine addiction and that
20	people smoked simply for the nicotine. And that was
21	based on scientific studies, for example of Michael
22	Russell in Great Britain who was widely quoted in
23	this country, studies that he had done in the early
24	1970's. And then there's another camp that thought
25	that cigarette smoking was really a social habit,
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 196
2	that people learned to smoke and they would smoke a
3	cigarette after breakfast or before breakfast or with
4	a drink or you know—but that was mostly a social
5	habit. That nicotine was still an important drug,
6	but it was reinforced by social habits. So you could
7	sort of see a balance between—of two theories that
8	were emerging in 1979.
9	Q. In the 1979 Surgeon General Report-
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	I'm sorry, did you finish your statement?
12	A. Well, I was going to move on to what happened between
13	1979 and the 1988 report. But then you were going to
14	start with something in 1979. So we can-
15	Q. Can I inteiject for a moment, in the 1979 Surgeon
16	General's Report did the surgeon general reach a
17	conclusion? You've described two camps, two schools
18	of thought; was there an ultimate conclusion reached
19	in the 1979 Surgeon General's Report?
20	A. Reading the report itself you see it in two camps. I
21	believe Julius Richmond used the term "addiction" in
22	his preface. But I'd have to review that to--I know
23	that (inaudible) conclusion, because I think you have
24	to read the body of the report to see that. But I
25	think he certainly uses that in his conclusion.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 197
2	Q. And I’m sorry I interrupted you, Dr. English.
3	A. Well, in 1988 was when the surgeon general, you know,
4	made a definitive statement. And you know, I think
5	a lot had happened since even 1979. One of the
6	things that happened was that the American
7	Psychiatric Association began defining what it called
8	a nicotine withdrawal syndrome. And it wasn’t that
9	the edginess when people stopped smoking—it wasn't
10	that the edginess had changed, it was that—how it
11	was described changed. The surgeon general said it
12	wasn't withdrawal in 1964, but the American
13	Psychiatric Association in its Diagnostic and
14	Statistical Manual in 1980 and then again in 1987
15	defined it as a withdrawal syndrome. So that—so the
16	definition began to shift. The idea of antisocial
17	behavior being part of the definition of addiction,
18	that dropped out. So it was no longer necessary.
19	The idea of intoxication was replaced with the idea
20	of neural behavioral effect. And so—and then of
21	course nicotine was the substance that had been
22	identified earlier, and that remained—there's
23	nothing different about the nicotine. And so what
24	happened, and then a couple of other things happened
25	sort of a social—social as well as scientific
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 198
2	nature. The National Institute for Drug Abuse in the
3	late 1970’s and certainly in the early 1980's began
4	listing or calling cigarette smoking, you know, an
5	addicting behavior. And the American Association of
6	Physicians in 1986 or '7 used similar terminology.
7	And so a number of things that--had happened between
8	1979 and 1988. But from my point of view what really
9	happened was the facts didn't change. The definition
10	changed. In other words, the definition that the
11	surgeon general was working off of in 1988 was
12	different from the definition that the Surgeon
13	General's Committee was working off in 1964.
14	You know, I often thought this is, you know,
15	sort of counter factual. But if the two committees
16	had been sitting, you know, 24 years apart, you know,
17	the '88 committee had been looking at, you know, it's
18	definition had met in 1964 using its criteria they
19	probably would have reached the '88 decision. And
20	had the '64 people have been sitting in 1988 with its
21	definition, it would have reached their conclusion.
22	Because the facts hadn't really changed, it was the
23	criteria of what the scientific community was willing
24	to call an addiction. That's what changed.
25	Q. Dr. English, would you consider yourself an expert in
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 199
2	addiction?
3	A. Well, you know, certainly I’ve studied addiction. As
4	a physician I read about addiction. As a
5	pediatrician I worry about addiction. I've read a
6	lot about the history of addiction. Sol have
7	expertise in it. I don't perforin experiments with,
8	you know, the animals on addiction. I have expertise
9	in-
10	Q. Do you consider yourself an expert in smoking
11	cessation?
12	A. Well, I’m an advocate of smoking cessation. And in
13	that, you know, I have one string to my—in my bow
14	when—if I have a patient of mine who is—who smokes,
15	I mean, I certainly tell them to stop it. Of course
16	that follows a long list of—not a long list—many
17	years of talking about not starting in the first
18	place. I do from time to time prescribe Zyban for
19	patients. I mean, my primary—my primary approach is
20	not medication, but I certainly am aware of them, of
21	the various ways that teenagers have been successful
22	in stopping smoking.
23	Q. Have you prescribed Zyban to teenagers?
24	A. Yes.
25	MS. KURTIN: Let1 s take a five-minute break.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 200
2	[Reces s 3:47 p.m. - 3:59 p.m.]
3	Q. Dr. English, the next section of your report I’d like
4	to discuss is under topic heading E, "The Public
5	Health Community’s Campaign to Inform the Public of
6	the Dangers of Smoking." You state that "The public
7	health community, including the Federal, State, and
8	local governments mounted an overwhelming educational
9	campaign in response to the evidence linking smoking
10	and disease from the time that evidence first emerged
11	through the present date." Can you just please
12	explain a little further what you mean by an
13	overwhelming educational campaign?
14	A. Yes, I can. It became a central area of concern of
15	the voluntary public health organizations such as the
16	American Cancer Society, the Heart Association, the
17	Lung Association, the Public Health Association at
18	their—at the Federal, State, and local level. When
19	these organizations—let’s take the American Cancer
20	Society as an example. Because there is a chapter of
21	the American Cancer Society in every county in the
22	country it was possible once the Cancer Society
23	decided it was going to do something about the
24	educational campaign it had the effector organ in the
25	community so that they could get the educational
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 201
2	message out. I've been through the educational
3	programs of the American Cancer Society from before
4	the first surgeon general’s report into the 1990's.
5	And there was a multi-prong approach that dealt with
6	school based programs, work based programs. It dealt
7	with radio. It dealt with television, public service
8	announcements. It dealt with newspaper spots. It
9	was simply enormous. Often times when the American
10	Cancer Society decided it was going to tally up it's
11	efforts it would be in the millions. And so we were
12	able to reach, you know, 20 million school children
13	doing this, or how many millions of other people.
14	Workers, and doing this particular—to give you an
15	example. There was an article published in the
16	Readers Digest in 1972, "Do You Know What Happens
17	When You Smoke?" It was basically what happens to
18	your body. They realized that this would have a
19	particular appeal to teenagers who have a lot of
20	concerns about what happens to their bodies in
21	general. And so they sent copies of it to every
22	secondary school child in the country. I mean,
23	that's power, to be able to have the ability to do
24	that. But it wasn't even 1972. They had a
25	newsreel—a film strip presentation, "To Smoke or Not
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 202
2	to Smoke" that came out in 1956, 1957. And by 1962
3	they felt that half of all school children in the
4	country had seen it. I’ve seen that film strip.
5	It’s very—from my point of view actually has too
6	much science. It’s almost like it’s trying to
7	convince high school biology students or college
8	students. But in any event, there’s—you know, when
9	the Cancer Society decided it was going to do
10	something they were able to affect it. Same thing
11	can be said about the Heart Association. You know,
12	its message is a little different, because as I
13	mentioned, smoking was just one of its concerns. And
14	actually, coronary artery disease is just one of the
15	heart diseases that the Heart Association was worried
16	about. But its message, you know, was clear. You
17	know, "Don't Smoke." And it reached pre-school kids,
18	you know, pre-kindergarten kids and Save a Sweetheart
19	Program—I mean, Heart Treasure Chest rather. And
20	Save a Sweetheart was for teenagers, and Heart at
21	Work was the program for people at the work place.
22	And again, lots of public service announcements that
23	were particularly important in the 1960's at each one
24	of these organizations. So from that point of view
25	both of these organizations cooperated with the
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 203
2	Federal Government in school based health education
3	programs of which smoking was an important component.
4	And so—and there were school education programs at
5	every level, for kindergarten, first, second, third,
6	high school level to get a flavor of some of this
7	education material. This 1989 Surgeon General's
8	Report I think puts it out as well as—in a summary
9	way, as I’ve seen, because it lists the organizations
10	within the Federal Government and its cooperation
11	with voluntary health organizations and gives a
12	very—I guess a fairly comprehensive view of the
13	educational programs. Another way of getting at this
14	is that the National Interagency Council on Smoking
15	and Health, which was an organization that came up
16	right after the Surgeon General’s Report in 1964,
17	which actually was a collaborative effort between
18	Federal agencies as well as the voluntary
19	organizations, published every year the number of
20	educational pamphlets and film strips and things that
21	were available for educational purposes. And that
22	came out years. And there are scores of educational
23	materials that were readily available. The Federal
24	Government, you know, put out it's own pamphlets. I
25	looked in particular some on the low tar story. If
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 204
2	you must smoke, five ways to cut down your risks. I
3	mean, one of those was low tar. But it's more than
4	just that. There are just many many many pamphlets
5	that the Federal Government put out on smoking and
6	smoking education. The media campaign, absolutely—I
7	mean, I'm going through in a detailed way what the
8	media was covering on smoking and health. So yes, it
9	was—it was really absolutely overwhelm—there is no
10	other word I can describe. It was overwhelming that
11	smoking was dangerous, leads to serious disease, it
12	kills. The overwhelming message was stop and don't
13	start. And if you must smoke, smoke cigarettes that
14	are low tar. It was not ambiguous. It was a very
15	clear message.
16	Q. Are you familiar with the annual budgets for this
17	educational campaign?
18	A. Well, it's hard to come up with an annual budget,
19	because there are so many organizations involved.
20	And I’ve never actually tallied, you know, taking all
21	the Federal Government programs, all the voluntary
22	organizations, looking at the State and local; I
23	don't have a sense of what that was. You know, one
24	of the things about it, what the Cancer Society would
25	often say was, you know, we don't need a big budget,
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 205
2	because we have, you know, 3,000 local chapters and
3	we have all the volunteers. Because, you know, when
4	you actually look at you know, how did they get it
5	into the school system, it was—the Cancer Society
6	would educate the workers in the local community, in
7	the local chapters. And then these people, mostly
8	women, would go in and work with the teachers in the
9	school system. And they would teach them about that.
10	The budget doesn’t have to be large to have the
11	effect to do that.
12	Q. So there were individual—individuals going into the
13	school systems teaching the message?
14	A. Yes. Many of these programs—sometimes the teacher
15	was the American Cancer Society volunteer. Sometimes
16	the volunteer taught the school teacher. I mean, I
17	think they had different approaches at different
18	times and a different curriculum.
19	Q. You mentioned in footnote 20 that the American Public
20	Health Association, American Heart Association, the
21	American Cancer Society, and the National
22	Tuberculosis Association put out a medical bulletin
23	on tobacco that you say reached the nation's 244,000
24	physicians, or every physician in the United States
25	in active practice.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 206
2	[English Exhibit No. 16 Marked]
3	Q I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Exhibit
4	16. It’s a document entitled "Reports on Tobacco and
5	Health Research." And on the second page it states
6	that it's published by the Tobacco Institute, Inc.
7	Have you seen any document such as this?
8	A. Oh, I'm sorry. I was—we were talking about the
9	medical bulletin on tobacco and then you handed me
10	this and I was trying to figure out was this the
11	medical bulletin on tobacco, an issue that I hadn't
12	seen. Because they—so—okay. So—
13	Q. No. This is not a medical bulletin on tobacco.
14	A. Okay. I'm sorry. I was thinking—all right. No. I
15	have not seen these.
16	Q. These were reports that were sent out by the Tobacco
17	Institute and were sent to 340,000 doctors, dentists,
18	and medical schools on issues of the tobacco
19	industry's interpretation on issues in smoking and
20	health. When you discuss the overwhelming
21	educational campaign is it of any consequence that
22	the tobacco industry was also sending out literature
23	to the physicians in the United States with its
24	interpretations of the smoking and health issues?
25	MR. NARKO: Objection.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 207
2	A. I haven’t read this, and you said the tobacco
3	industry. I see Tobacco Institute. So, you know, I
4	don’t want to (inaudible) things to tightly, but I'm
5	not sure, you know, how we—you know, we said tobacco
6	industry. The industry is a very—many companies.
7	Q. Are you familiar—well, I’m sorry.
8	A. And so I don't really know—my—you know, in my
9	reading of what the—this is sent to physicians, is
10	that physicians after the 1964 Surgeon General's
11	Report in no significant numbers had any doubt about
12	the causation of lung cancer. You know, we went from
13	that 50 percent Louis Robbins was worried about in
14	'62. I mean, I think that that largely evaporated.
15	And so, you know, I think—I don’t think that the
16	American physicians turned to the Tobacco Institute
17	for medical or health facts or opinions. I mean, I
18	certainly don’t see journals like this cited in any
19	medical articles that I've read. I don’t see any
20	public health organization turning to the Tobacco
21	Institute for any—for any health information. I
22	don't see any of the public health community changing
23	its opinions in any way.
24	Q. Are you familiar with an entity called the Tobacco
25	Institute?
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 208
2	A. I mean, I know it exists. I know it came to exist
3	somewhere in 1954, went out of existence recently.
4	But I haven’t paid any concerted effort to study it.
5	I mean, in a general way, I mean, since I’ve read,
6	you know, a lot of media reports, you know,
7	occasionally I would come across some things from the
8	Tobacco Institute, especially in the 50's. But I
9	haven't made a systematic effort in that regard.
10	Q. You next talk about the National Clearing House on
11	Smoking and Health.
12	A. Uh-huh.
13	Q. And how the National Clearing House later, which
14	later became the Office On Smoking and Health worked
15	closely with leading experts around the country to
16	insure that each surgeon general's report achieved a
17	great deal of consensus. When you refer to consensus
18	here, you talked earlier about the various surgeon
19	general reports that were issued. Were the
20	subsequent surgeon general reports addressing areas
21	that were controversial in the same way as the 1964
22	Surgeon General’s Report?
23	MR. NARKO: Objection.
24	A. The—there’s certainly controversial areas in each
25	one, I think. And we’d have to go through which
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 209
2	ones. And often times they’ll tell you right there
3	in the preface whether the issues that they’re
4	looking at were, you know. And sometimes the best
5	place to look for the consensus statement is in the
6	preface. But when you read into the body of the
7	report you see that there’s—there are differences
8	between the experts and reading the reports. You
9	know, I think the first report probably had the
10	greatest care as far—I think in reaching its
11	conclusions, I think perhaps because of the import of
12	the moment. But I think that there—I think there
13	was an attempt in the review of the surgeon general's
14	reports which are explained in a number of the
15	reports. But then there is an attempt to reach a
16	consensus.
17	Q. And do you know what the annual budget was for the
18	National Clearing House on Smoke which later became
19	the Office on Smoking and Health?
20	A. I don't recall the number. I’ve seen the number, but
21	I don't know what it is.
22	Q. Do you know how that budget compares to the tobacco
23	industry's advertising and marketing budget?
24	A. Much less.
25	Q. One-tenth as less?
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 210
2	A. I bet it’s less than that.
3	Q. So at the same time the public health community was
4	mounting this educational campaign this was also done
5	in a climate in which the tobacco industry was
6	spending a significant amount of money on advertising
7	and marketing its products; is that correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. The advertising and marketing expenditures of the
10	tobacco industry, do you think that those
11	expenditures contributed to the number of people who
12	currently smoke?
13	MR. NARKO: Objection.
14	A. Currently smoke in 2002 or in any given moment in the
15	past?
16	Q. Well, let's go—you mentioned 1989, Koop. And he
17	said at that point 32 percent of the American
18	population still smoked. To me 32 percent is still a
19	fair number of smokers. That's despite 25 years of
20	what you call an overwhelming educational campaign.
21	And what I'm trying to get at is do you have any
22	opinions as to why in 1989 the 32 percent of the
23	population did smoke in light of the material, the
24	educational material that had been distributed?
25	MR. NARKO: Objection.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 211
2	A. Certainly the—there are a lot of cigarette
3	advertisements, there's no question about that. I
4	know the public health community has, you know,
5	addressed issues of cigarette advertising in several
6	of the surgeon general's reports, especially dealing
7	with youth initiation and other concerns. You know,
8	the way I look at the effect or the influence of
9	cigarette advertising—I mean, I need to tell you up
10	front, is that, you know, I haven’t studied every ad,
11	and I don't—I mean, I certainly came across a lot of
12	ads. So let me tell you what I think about that. I
13	think one of the most sensitive indicators of the
14	effect—the influence of ads is to look at public
15	opinion polls. And public opinion polls are what
16	people believe at the end of the day from all sources
17	of information. In other words, what they learned
18	about smoking from their kindergarten teacher, what
19	they learned from public service announcement, what
20	they read on a pack in a warning, and you know, ads
21	they've seen, what they’ve learned from their
22	parents, what they’ve learned at church, a whole
23	bunch of reasons. And at the end of the day someone
24	says, you know, what do you—what do you think about
25	cigarette smoking? And after 1977 what do you think
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 212
2	about cigarette smoking and you? And I think the
3	numbers show very clearly that an ever increasing
4	number of the American public both were aware and
5	then believed that smoking was a cause of serious
6	disease and death, and that when the polls started
7	asking those questions they said it was a problem for
8	me if I was a smoker. But the specific question you
9	asked me, what about the people who heard the
10	message, clearly heard the message, understood the
11	message, and then still smoked. That’s something I
12	think you have to ask the individual smoker. I mean,
13	I think it comes down to individual questions. And I
14	don't have a good answer why they did.
15	Q. So as a historian looking at this issue of smoking
16	rates you've reached no conclusion as to why people
17	continued to smoke over time?
18	A. You know, I’m tempted to say it’s because they like
19	to. But I think the reasons people choose to smoke,
20	in the beginning I think it’s initiation. There is a
21	lot of studies on initiation, I mean, why people
22	smoke. Has to do with their parents, their peers.
23	Why they continue, I think it’s an individual. I
24	mean, I ask my patients, the ones that do smoke, get
25	lots of individual answers on that. But I don’t have
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 213
2	a—I can’t be too much more specific than that.
3	Q. And just to go back, I had—I believe I asked you
4	whether you thought that expenditures by the tobacco
5	industry on advertising and marketing contributed to
6	the smoking rates. And you talked about public
7	opinion polls that showed what people believed at the
8	end of the day. But I guess my question is, the
9	public opinion polls are what people believe. But
10	people are actually doing is something different.
11	And do you have any opinion about whether the tobacco
12	industry's expenditures on marketing and advertising
13	contribute at all to the—what people are actually
14	doing?
15	MR. NARKO: Objection.
16	A. No, I don’t.
17	Q. On the bottom of page 9 you state that "The Federal
18	Government also participated in the educational
19	campaign. It funded pilot projects in communities,
20	developed educational programs for school children at
21	all levels, required warnings on cigarette packages,
22	regulated cigarette advertising, sponsored public
23	service messages, funded research, issued
24	comprehensive surgeon general reports, raised excise
25	taxes, limited smoking in Federal buildings, polled
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 214
2	Americans about their knowledge of smoking risks to
3	mention only a few activities." I do have a couple
4	of questions about this paragraph. Are there other
5	activities that your list does not include?
6	A. Well, of course each one of these is—you know, is a
7	complicated story. And I think the—you know, I
8	think the '89 Surgeon General’s Report is a good way
9	of getting a grasp. It's just—the Federal
10	Government participated in so many ways in so many
11	different—many of its agencies. You know, one of
12	the things that I didn’t quite cover in this, because
13	it ended in 1989, the role of the Environmental
14	Protection Agency and its reports in 1992, which
15	obviously came after this report and the influence
16	that that had on, you know, of worker—of smoking and
17	work sites around the country that were not
18	controlled by the Federal Government. So we’re not
19	talking about a government building here, or I think
20	is an example after the 1989. But I think the '89
21	Surgeon General’s Report is a very good place to look
22	for an idea of Federal Government activities.
23	Q. And with respect to these activities that you go
24	through in this paragraph, are you aware of any
25	activity by the tobacco industry in response to the
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 215
2	government's initiatives in these matters? And my
3	main example would be lobbying, for example, to
4	prevent proposed legislation.
5	MR. NARKO: Objection.
6	A. That's not something I've studied.
7	Q. Do you believe that these activities that you list
8	contributed to the lowering of smoking rates in the
9	country? And we’ll just go up through the 1989
10	Surgeon General’s Report.
11	A. Well, certainly one of the thrusts of the 1989
12	Surgeon General’s Report was trying to evaluate the
13	effectiveness of these programs. And its conclusion
14	in general was that, yes, that these programs had
15	been effective. On the other hand, when you get down
16	to individual programs, it also detailed the ones
17	that they thought had been, you know, more effective
18	than others. But in general the Surgeon General's
19	Report concluded that they—that these efforts had
20	been successful.
21	Q. For example, limiting smoking in Federal buildings.
22	Do you know if the tobacco industry opposed
23	regulation limiting smoking in Federal buildings?
24	A. I don't know.
25	MR. NARKO: Objection.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 216
2	I don't know that.
3	Q. And do you know if the Federal Government limited
4	smoking in Federal buildings?
5	A. I do know that.
6	Q. And do you have an opinion about whether it was
7	effective in contributing to the reduction of smoking
8	rates?
9	MR. NARKO: Objection.
10	A. That I don’t really—don’t really know. I mean,
11	there had been—there were comments in the public
12	health literature to the effect that you know, well,
13	if people can't smoke all the time at work were
14	helping the overall problem because there are fewer
15	moments when people can smoke. If you make smoking
16	less socially acceptable we might be able to. But I
17	don't—I’m not aware that the reduction of smoking in
18	Federal buildings that occurred after 1976, and with
19	the various GSA recommendations in the various
20	departments of government I'm not aware of an
21	analysis that would indicate that in Federal
22	employees. I mean, they may—that may exist. I
23	just—I can’t recall one at the moment.
24	Q. So for instance you can’t comment on whether—if the
25	legislation had been earlier would they have been
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 217
2	able to contribute more—
3	MR. NARKO: Objection.
4	—to the issue?
5	MR. NARKO: Objection.
6	A. No. I really can’t.
7	Q. With respect to raising excise taxes, can you tell me
8	how that—you say the Federal government participated
9	in the educational campaign and you list activities.
10	How does raising excise taxes fit in with smoking
11	rates?
12	A. Well, there's been a debate in the public health
13	community that if the cost of cigarettes rises to a
14	certain point that smokers will find it—just that
15	they can't afford. And there’s been at least some
16	discussion that this is particularly effective in
17	younger smokers. That teenagers will moderate their
18	buying patterns if cigarette smoking is—if cigarette
19	packs are more expensive.
20	Q. And do you have an opinion on the impact of that?
21	A. I don't have an opinion on that. I mean, I have—and
22	I've had a discussion with my own patients who smoke,
23	and there's been a general sense that cigarettes cost
24	too much, even in the state of North Carolina. But
25	you know, that's really my personal level. I think
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 218
2	that, you know, the studies I have read that is, you
3	know, is that with increasing prices there's a
4	decrease in teenagers spending. I think there have
5	been some people who have said that that may not
6	always be the case, may not be the case across
7	various ethnic groups. And so that's—you know, I
8	realize that that’s an area that the public health
9	community has struggled with.
10	Q. And are you aware of any efforts on the part of the
11	tobacco industry to resist excise taxes being
12	assessed?
13	MR. NARKO: Objection.
14	A. That’s not something I've studied.
15	Q. When you discussed earlier the polls that you've
16	researched on, the awareness of smoking causing
17	disease and the awareness of personal risks, can
18	you—
19	A. It’s more—awareness is a technical term in polling.
20	So it’s awareness and believe.
21	Q. Awareness and belief. Were those polls conducted of
22	adults or of children?
23	A. Both. Mostly of adults. The polling of children is
24	less extensive. But in—I am aware of actually
25	children are ahead of adults in their beliefs.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 219
2	Q. And which polls are you aware of? The polls that you
3	refer to, for instance, on page 11, and you go
4	through a number of examples. Are those polls in
5	this paragraph on page 11—
6	A. No, they aren't. These are—I didn't cite the polls
7	on adolescence in this.
8	Q. Okay. So this paragraph on page 11 are adult polls?
9	A. Yes. Yes. In fact, I think I even say that 90
10	percent of adults—there are independent polls of
11	adolescents, and actually the numbers are—the ones
12	I've seen are actually higher.
13	Q. And what years?
14	A. I think that even from the very beginning. I think
15	that some of the polls I first saw were before the
16	Surgeon General’s Report of 1960. George Gallop had
17	an article discussing the results in 1977 talking
18	about teenagers and smoking.
19	Q. I'm sorry. Before the Surgeon General's Report was
20	there a poll?
21	A. There's a poll that was published in Senior
22	Scholastic in 1960.
23	Q. So there's a poll in 1960 about—
24	A. Right. As I'm sitting here, there's a poll that
25	George Gallop was so impressed with that he made it a
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 220
2	subject of a column that occurred, you know, it was
3	in 1977.
4	Q. Okay. So he discusses that in 19—he discusses the
5	1960 poll in 1977 or was there a new poll in 1977?
6	A. New polls, new polls.
7	Q. News polls.
8	A. Right.
9	Q. And what did those polls show; do you have—do you
10	recall?
11	A. My recollection of the polls on children are that
12	children had an awareness and a belief that was
13	higher than adults about the dangers of smoking
14	cigarettes.
15	Q. Did the dangers make it more attractive?
16	MR. NARKO: Objection.
17	A. I have no i—I think that gets down to an individual
18	smoker level. You'd have to ask them.
19	Q. Going back to page 9, again, talking about those
20	activities by the Federal Government and its
21	educational campaign you mention regulated cigarette
22	advertising. Do you have any examples of how the
23	government regulated cigarette advertising?
24	A. I do.
25	Q. Can you discuss that, please?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 221
2	A. Well, the agency that's been involved in regulating
3	cigarette advertising is the Federal Trade
4	Commission. The Trade Commission has been interested
5	in regulating cigarette ads going back to the 30's
6	and 40's. And with the beginning of the health
7	scares in the 1950’s issued in 1955, issued
8	guidelines about what can be in cigarette
9	advertising, especially health claims. And those
10	guidelines in many respects are still in effect.
11	They were modified a bit in 1959, 1960 with the
12	explicit instruction that a tar and nicotine level
13	would be considered a health claim and that it was
14	not to be permitted. They reversed that decision in
15	1966 with—at the request of various public health
16	organizations as well as including members of the
17	Federal Government. One of the parts of the Federal
18	Government who wanted to encourage smokers to smoke
19	lower tar and nicotine cigarettes and therefore
20	having a number on there was particularly important
21	so that cigarettes could—or smokers could compare.
22	In 1967 the FDC in order to put that policy into
23	effect began measuring with the Cambridge method tar
24	and nicotine levels so smokers could compare. In
25	1971 or '12 the FDC required that print advertising
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 222
2	have both the wamings--which is of course another
3	control on tobacco smoking which we haven't discussed
4	yet—be on there as well as the tar and nicotine.
5	And that coincided with the year before with the
6	removal of cigarette advertising completely from
7	radio and television. The FDC has reviewed the issue
8	of cigarette advertising and what’s permissible in
9	ads on many occasions and has also reviewed on many
10	occasions what is the appropriate method to test for
11	tar and nicotine levels in cigarettes for comparative
12	purposes.
13	Q. You mentioned it so let’s go back to it, requiring
14	warnings on cigarette packages. Do you think this
15	was an effective educational campaign?
16	A. Well, certainly, you know, after 1966 cigarette
17	warnings have been on every pack of cigarettes no
18	matter what kind of cigarettes they were. And people
19	are certainly aware of the warnings. I mean, aware
20	that they exist. How the existence of the warning
21	contributes to the—to public behavior is something
22	certainly the Surgeon General’s Report in 1989
23	addressed as one of the many measures. And the
24	public health community in that report certainly
25	thought that the warnings had been effective.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 223
2	Q. Has there ever been a debate about whether the
3	warnings should be more explicit and more graphic?
4	A. The warnings had been discussed at various times, but
5	first of all, they’re Congressionally mandated
6	warnings. They were discussed in ’65 and '66 leading
7	to the first one. They were revised again in ’69,
8	’84. At each point there were a variety of wordings
9	that were suggested before Congress decided what
10	warning was going to go on.
11	Q. I'm referring to—has there been a debate in the
12	public health community about whether even more
13	explicit and more graphic warnings should be required
14	on cigarettes?
15	A. There have been some, especially in other countries.
16	Canada has more graphic warnings. I think some of
17	the European countries have. I’m not aware of too
18	much of that discussion in this country.
19	MS. KURTIN: We need to take a break to change
20	the tape.
21	[Recess 4:38 p.m - 4:45 p.m.]
22	Q. Dr. English, on page 10 or your expert report you
23	state at the top of the page that, "The Federal
24	Government and the public health community were also
25	long aware of the possible health consequences of
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 224
2	environmental tobacco smoke." When you say "long
3	aware" what timeframe are you—what timeframe are you
4	referring to?
5	A. 1972 is the first time the surgeon general raised
6	this as an issue in the surgeon general's report.
7	Q. And in the—what you’ve termed the overwhelming
8	educational campaign of the public health community
9	following the 1964 Surgeon General's Report was there
10	a component of that campaign that addressed the
11	possible health consequences of environmental tobacco
12	smoke?
13	A. There was. In fact, when the surgeon general
14	mentions in 1972 that that—even though it's a really
15	fairly small portion of the 1972 report, that was
16	widely covered in the media. The surgeon general
17	raised it again in a number of other—a couple of
18	other reports before 1986. But the issue of the
19	potential of health consequences of being in the same
20	room with people smoking was something that the
21	public health community and particularly the media
22	discussed increasingly in the 1970's and into the
23	1980's.
24	Q. And when you say discussed, was there a educational
25	component to the public about it?
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 225
2	A. Yes. There was a component of worrying about that.
3	It often took the form of let’s see if we can get
4	your—you know, your local community to restrict
5	smoking in restaurants. Let’s see if you can get the
6	work place without—without smoking. The precise
7	dangers of—health dangers from environmental tobacco
8	smoke was evolving. Surgeon General Steinfeld in
9	1972 thought that, you know, that maybe it was the
10	carbon monoxide that's in cigarette smoke, that was
11	something that was going to cause harm. And there
12	was a lot of discussion about that in the public
13	health community in the 1970's and early 80's. But
14	the science did not really coalesce around this until
15	the 1980's.
16	Q. And you said the science did not coalesce until the
17	1980's. When would you consider a coalescence?
18	A. Well, there is a—this is one surgeon general's
19	report where I think there is a fair amount of
20	controversy even though that there were conclusions
21	about what the dangers of environmental tobacco smoke
22	indeed are. One of the concerns that were raised,
23	which I think is less controversial is that smoking
24	around infants and small children increases the
25	number of hospitalizations for lower respiratory
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 226
2	illnesses. I think that—I think that that's
3	harder—is based on a harder science. I think
4	there’s been some real controversy about another
5	conclusion, was that environmental tobacco smoke is
6	responsible for anywhere from 4 or 500 to 4 or 5,000
7	of deaths from lung cancer each year. And again,
8	that was—I think a close reading of the Surgeon
9	General’s Report of 1986 indicates that there were
10	some studies that would indicate that there was a
11	concern for lung cancer and there were other studies
12	that did not show that, did not have that concern.
13	Q. And what is the current opinion on environmental
14	tobacco smoke and disease?
15	MR. NARKO: Objection.
16	A. Well, you know, it gets very complicated, because as
17	you probably know, and far better than I, you know,
18	the EPA got involved. The EPA's decisions got
19	involved in various court cases, court of appeals
20	cases. And so I can tell you what the public health
21	community and what's happened since then, the exact
22	status of some of these recommendations, because of
23	court decisions I'm not perhaps as clear as I might
24	be. But certainly, you know, smoking in public
25	places in this country has become increasingly rare.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 227
2	And I think that's a result of the public health
3	community. In particular I think it got a tremendous
4	boost from the '86 Surgeon General’s Report. It got
5	a boost again from the EPA report. The surgeon
6	generals' reports, you know, just list the—you know,
7	the number of communities that restrict smoking in
8	public spaces, the number of private business,
9	schools, universities, doctors offices, hospitals.
10	It's hard to smoke in public at the end of the 20th
11	century, much harder than it was in the beginning of
12	the 20th century.
13	Q. And are you aware of any efforts by the tobacco
14	industry to oppose regulation of restrictions on
15	smoking?
16	A. That’s not something that I've studied.
17	Q. Although not something that you have studied in your
18	review of the literature have you seen any
19	indications in the media about the tobacco industry’s
20	efforts?
21	A. None that I can characterize. That's just not an
22	area that I was looking at.
23	Q. And any awareness of any lobbying efforts?
24	MR. NARKO: Objection.
25	A. That’s not something I studied.
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 228
2	Q. Are you familiar with an entity called the Center for
3	Indoor Air Research, CIAR?
4	A. I'm not sure that I do under that; can you be more
5	specific? Maybe that will jog my memory.
6	Q. Just as the tobacco industry formed the Tobacco
7	Industry Research Council, TIRC, there was a similar
8	entity with members of the tobacco industry set up to
9	study environmental tobacco smoke issues.
10	MR. NARKO: Objection.
11	A. Well, I don't know about the—about the more recent
12	one. I just want to be sure that the TIRC was—the
13	science was actually carried out by, you know,
14	scientists who were awarded grants in universities
15	around the country. So there were, you know,
16	researchers from Harvard, and Yale, and Washington
17	University, Duke, you know got—in other words, the
18	research was not carried out by the tobacco industry
19	or tobacco industry scientists in TIRC. So I don’t
20	know about this other organization.
21	Q. I'm sorry.
22	A. You characterized them together.
23	Q. As—well, as—the member companies of TIRC, which
24	later became CTR. So the funders of the scientific
25	research that was—I wasn’t saying that the tobacco
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 229
2	industry conducted the science through CTR, but the
3	organization that was CTR, its board of directors,
4	its members were—its member companies
5	were—represent—were members of the tobacco
6	industry.
7	MR. NARKO: Objection.
8	A. I'm not exactly sure I accept the characterization of
9	who was on the board and how that relates to the
10	scientific advisory board. I guess I’m confused,
11	because we’re talking about an organization that I
12	don’t think I know anything about.
13	Q. Okay, and that’s fine.
14	A. And you’re comparing it to an organization I do know
15	something about. So it’s kind of hard to make
16	the—hard to make the comparisons here. So let’s go
17	back to your original question. I mean, about this
18	Indoor Air-
19	Q. CIAR, Center for Indoor Air Research. If you're not
20	aware of it—
21	A. I'm not aware of it.
22	Q. Okay. Going back to—what is your understanding of
23	what TIRC, later CTR is or was?
24	A. TIRC was formed in 1954 to investigate issues dealing
25	with smoking and disease.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 230
2	Q. Do you know who formed TIRC?
3	A. It was formed by—the money was put up by tobacco
4	corporations. I have read all of the annual reports
5	of the TIRC and CTR. So I know—I haven’t—it
6	appointed to run its scientific component a
7	Scientific Advisory Board, which was separated from
8	the tobacco industry funding. It was set up
9	deliberately to be independent.
10	Q, And-
11	MR. NARKO: Objection.
12	I'm sorry. Didn’t mean to interrupt.
13	A. But I know mostly about the workings of the
14	Scientific Advisory Board. Over the years the
15	Scientific Advisory Board gave out grants, I believe
16	over 3,000 grants to scientists in major scientific
17	research groups, medical centers around the country.
18	About half of those research efforts led to
19	publications in major medical journals.
20	Q. And would TIRC be part of the public health
21	community?
22	A. Well, it's part of—this was really more of the
23	scientific community. In other words, they didn't
24	deal with policy recommendations to the—I think in
25	any big sense. I mean, I look at what the work of
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 231
2	the TIRC and the publication and scientific research
3	as contributing to the scientific discussion more
4	than the public health discussion, especially after
5	1964.
6	Q. And when you said that SAB gave out 3,000 grants do
7	you know where the money for those grants came from,
8	where the source of the funding was?
9	A. It came from tobacco companies.
10	Q. Are you familiar with special projects that were
11	conducted?
12	A. My understanding was that separate from the
13	Scientific Advisory body there was a series of
14	company sponsored research projects in the 1960’s. I
15	think that’s what you're referring to, is special
16	projects.
17	Q. Is it your understanding that this was just in the
18	1960’s?
19	A. That’s the only place where I--the only time period
20	that I can recall seeing that.
21	Q. And your research or your understanding about this
22	issue comes from reading the annual reports of the
23	TIRC or CTR?
24	A. I can't remember whether it comes from the annual
25	reports of the CTR or whether I've seen that
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 232
2	elsewhere.
3	Q. Have you ever done any independent research on the
4	issue of TIRC, which later became CTR?
5	A. What I’ve done is what I’ve said, is I've read the
6	annual reports. So that’s independent—I think
7	that’s what I would call independent research. Did
8	you have something else in mind?
9	Q. Any other investigation into reports of the media
10	about TIRC or CTR?
11	A. TIRC, I mean, the research effort of that was much
12	discussed, especially in the years before the surgeon
13	general's report.
14	Q. And how about prior to the 1964 Surgeon General's
15	Report?
16	A. That’s what I mean, the years prior. That’s what I
17	meant to say.
18	Q. The years after the 1964 Surgeon General’s Report?
19	A. That became less covered by the media than the
20	earlier, in part I think because the research effort
21	in tobacco, just a number of—you know, the Federal
22	Government began sponsoring a lot more research where
23	in the years before the surgeon general's report the
24	Federal Government had sponsored less in the way of
25	research. Early on the Tobacco Industry Research
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 233
2	Council was doing a significant proportion of the
3	funding in research. And that was news, and that's
4	why it was covered in some detail in the years from
5	1954 on.
6	Q. And in the years after the 1964 Surgeon General's
7	Report?
8	A. I don’t see as much in the media discussion after the
9	first surgeon general’s report about what the CTR was
10	doing.
11	Q. Do you know if they were doing significant research
12	on the issues of smoking and health?
13	A. They were. And I think all the way through they
14	were. And one measure of that is to look at the
15	number of studies that were co-funded. In the annual
16	reports they list projects that were--a researcher
17	would put in what they would fund and it was a
18	co-funded. And in the years, for example, before the
19	surgeon general’s report probably 60 percent were
20	co-funded by organizations, some by the Federal
21	Government, by the Public Health Service or the
22	Cancer Institute, some by the American Cancer
23	Society, and others. After the surgeon general's
24	report, between then and when the CTR ceased in the
25	90's sometime over 80 percent were co-funded. I
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 234
2	mean, I think that gives an idea that these were, you
3	know, legitimate scientific endeavors carried out,
4	you know, in many many research centers around the
5	country, medical centers around the country.
6	Q. But there wasn’t a lot of media attention?
7	A. I found, you know, not something I went looking for,
8	but just as I sit here, the media attention to what
9	was then the CTR after the surgeon general’s report
10	and the research that its scientists were—you know,
11	its funded scientists were carrying out, I don't
12	think received the media attention as it earlier had.
13	Q. You next state that the Federal Government was always
14	aware—always fully aware of scientific, medical, and
15	public health aspects of smoking and disease. How do
16	you reach the determination that the federal
17	government was always—I am emphasizing your
18	words—always fully aware; what’s the basis for your
19	opinion?
20	A. You know, I think you read the surgeon generals’
21	reports; it is a compendium of the knowledge of the
22	scientific community on smoking and health. Those—I
23	mean, there are thousands and thousands and thousands
24	of articles that were published there. Its purpose,
25	the surgeon generals’ reports purpose was to survey,
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 235
2	to analyze, to distill the scientific knowledge. I
3	mean, its an inescapable conclusion.
4	Q. Did the tobacco industry conduct independent research
5	on smoking and health; did the individual tobacco
6	companies conduct research on smoking and health
7	issues?
8	A. It did, but that's not something that I have looked
9	at in detail.
10	Q. So if you haven’t looked at it in detail you won't be
11	able to answer if the Federal Government was always
12	fully aware of the research efforts by the individual
13	tobacco companies?
14	MR. NARKO: Objection.
15	A. In this case and other cases that I’ve been involved
16	I've been shown research reports that plaintiffs have
17	put forward on the issue, which have purported to
18	show knowledge that was not readily out there. And I
19	haven't seen it yet.
20	Q. You haven’t seen what yet?
21	A. I haven’t seen evidence that the tobacco companies
22	had significant scientific knowledge that was
23	not—that the public health community is not aware
24	of.
25	Q. Did they have any scientific knowledge?
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 236
2	A. I can't—I can't answer that.
3	Q. Do you think that there would be people who would
4	disagree with your statement that the Federal
5	Government was always fully aware of scientific,
6	medical, and public health aspects of smoking and
7	disease?
8	MR. NARKO: Objection.
9	A. I don’t know.
10	Q. And again, later on in that paragraph you say, "At no
11	point was the Federal Government unaware of any
12	significant development in the field of smoking and
13	health." And to confirm, you didn't review internal
14	industry documents—
15	MR. NARKO: Objection.
16	A. No. Not in a systematic fashion. I have reviewed
17	some that have been put in evidence in this and other
18	cases.
19	Q. If you had desired to review internal industry
20	documents on a particular smoking and health issue
21	could you have requested access to such documents?
22	A. I assume I could have. I haven't.
23	Q. And do you think it would have been at all a
24	worthwhile exercise to review for yourself what the
25	industry—
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 237
2	MR. NARKO: Objection.
3	A. I don’t consider the tobacco industry a part of the
4	public health community. We've talked about that
5	earlier. So I really see no particular reason to do
6	that.
7	Q. Well, I'm not talking about at this point whether the
8	tobacco industry is part of the public health
9	community. I’m talking about your statement that the
10	Federal Government—at no point was the Federal
11	Government unaware of any significant development in
12	the field of smoking and health. And that to me is a
13	different statement than whether the tobacco industry
14	is part of the public health community.
15	MR. NARKO: Objection.
16	A. I understand the distinction. But I want to come
17	back to the Surgeon General's the Office of Smoking
18	and Health. It’s purpose in the surgeon generals'
19	report was to get—was to catalogue, analyze this
20	field. And I think they did that. I'm unaware of
21	any important information that they were unaware of.
22	I just haven't seen it.
23	Q. And you would include the topic of addiction?
24	MR. NARKO: Objection.
25	A. We talked about addiction earlier. I think that the
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 238
2	Federal Government in the reports that it was citing
3	in the surgeon generals’ reports were well aware of
4	the science of addiction.
5	Q. I have a question about the paragraphs basically
6	contained on pages 10 and 11. You talk about the
7	activities of the American Cancer Society and also
8	the American Heart Association. And your citation in
9	your footnotes 21 and 22 are to respectively the
10	annual reports of those organizations. Is it—what
11	is your opinion on the use of annual reports for a
12	historical analysis?
13	MR. NARKO: Objection.
14	A. I they’re a very sensitive way of telling what the
15	organization is doing, what its purposes are, what
16	its programs are, you know, how it's going—what its
17	philosophy is, how its going about it. In addition
18	was that when the—one of these organizations cited
19	an activity I would also go look at that. So I know
20	what was in the various programs, the various—you
21	know, and the American Cancer Society has a--had a
22	curriculum. I got those materials and read the
23	curriculum. When they said that they were putting
24	out comic books, Spider Man comic books to reach kids
25	I read the Spider Man comic books. When they—as
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 239
2	best I could, you know, public service announcements,
3	I've seen them. So I use—of course I guess this is
4	sort of an index of what I needed to look at.
5	Q.	So you didn't just rely on annual reports?
6	A.	Oh, no.
7	MR. NARKO: Objection.
8	No, I didn’t.
9	Q.	Can annual reports be self serving statements for an
10	organization?
11	MR. NARKO: Objection.
12	A. I'm sure they can be. But as I say, you know, I
13	tried to independently verify that if they said that
14	they had a program called Art Treasure Chest that you
15	know, that it did exist and looked for evidence for
16	what the curriculum was and all.
17	Q. On page 11 you state that "All aspects of the public
18	health initiative were closely followed and analyzed
19	in the media. Scientific research and the public
20	health communities’ activities were often front page
21	news in major newspapers and magazines." Are you
22	aware of any allegations or studies that were done
23	that look at the likelihood of a magazine to publish
24	smoking and health articles in correlation to the
25	amount of money or advertising that magazine receives
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 240
2	from the tobacco industry?
3	MR. NARKO: Objection.
4	A. I'm aware of—I have read one or two of those. So I
5	am aware of it. I can’t be more specific on that. I
6	mean, you said—
7	Q. When you say you are aware, do you recall which
8	articles that you’ve reviewed?
9	A. No, I don't.
10	[English Exhibit No. 17 Marked]
11	Q. I'm handing you what’s been marked as Exhibit 17. I
12	apologize for the format. The first two pages were
13	printed off the New England Journal of Medicine web
14	site for this volume. And then the article itself
15	was printed off of (inaudible). It’s an article by
16	Kenneth Warner entitled "Cigarette Advertising and
17	Magazine Coverage of the Hazards of Smoking, A
18	Statistical Analysis." And it was found in this that
19	the likelihood of publishing an article on the risks
20	of smoking was less for magazines that carried
21	tobacco advertisements than for those that didn't,
22	particularly in women’s magazines. In any—if—just
23	for a hypothetical, if that were the case do you
24	think that the message then the public health
25	campaign was thwarted in any way by the likelihood of
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 241
2	stories reaching magazines carrying tobacco
3	advertisements?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	A. Well, I can’t remember whether I've read this
6	article. So if you want me—I can read it now if you
7	want me to read it and give you an opinion on the
8	article and how this fits into the public health.
9	But I'm reluctant to give you a comment on this
10	article without reading it.
11	Q. Okay. Do you have a comment on the theory?
12	MR. NARKO: Objection.
13	A. On the theory that—which theory?
14	Q. That-
15	A. That the message would not get through; that
16	the—that the advertising revenues led to editorial
17	decisions on stories? I don’t know what theory
18	you're talking about.
19	Q. If we start with a hypothetical premise, that a
20	magazine was less likely to publish an article
21	contrary to the tobacco industry or publish an
22	article on the smoking risks—the risks of smoking
23	would that have any impact upon the public health's
24	educational campaign?
25	MR. NARKO: Objection.
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 242
2	A. I don’t accept the premise. I don’t know whether
3	it’s—that's true or not. What I do know is again,
4	going back to the public opinion polls, that I do
5	know that Americans at the end of the day—what
6	message they were receiving. And it was precisely
7	the message that the public health community wanted
8	them to receive. And that is that smoking kills,
9	responsible for major disease, and that the American
10	people believed that, you know, generally and
11	believed that in a personal sense once the polls
12	began to register that. And that doesn’t make a
13	difference whether they get it from one magazine or
14	another magazine or from the school program, a work
15	program, on kindergarten, church, the pack of the
16	carton—the cigarette pack with the warning on it. I
17	don't want you to think that I'm in any way agreeing
18	with the article. I can't agree or disagree with the
19	article. I can't remember whether I've read it.
20	So—but you asked me the premise, if an article did
21	or did not appear in a given magazine would that make
22	it different. No. I don't think so.
23	Q. So I guess my question is, the messages that were
24	being received from advertising in media and
25	statements doubting the links between smoking and
1	Dr. English	Direct Page 243
2	disease, that didn't have any impact on people's
3	actions or attitudes towards smoking?
4	MR. NARKO: Objection.
5	A. Again, what—you're talking about magazines and then
6	we’re talking about—what are the other ones here?
7	You gave a list here and I’m trying to sort out your
8	list.
9	Q. I guess a person takes in information from various
10	sources—
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. --and can be aware of a particular issue, say that
13	issue is, smoking causes disease. Even if they were
14	to hold that belief do you think that information
15	received from other sources could have an impact upon
16	their actions about how they utilize that knowledge?
17	MR. NARKO: Objection.
18	A. I think at the end of the day the public opinion
19	polls measure that, measure the effect of all sources
20	of information a person receives.
21	MS. KURTIN: Can we take a break.
22	[Recess 5:19 p.m. - 5:24 p.m.]
23	Q. Dr. English, I’d like to break the deposition at this
24	point and put on the record that the United States
25	has used 6 hours and 25 minutes so far for this
1	Dr. English	Direct	Page 244
2	deposition, and just to confirm that we will continue
3	this deposition on Monday in Washington, D.C.
4	THE WITNESS: I will be there.
