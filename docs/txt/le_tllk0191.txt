1	VIDEO REPORTER:
2	My name is Hugh Garraway, certified
3	court videographer, representing Veritext
4	National Deposition and Litigation Services.
5	The date today is August 24th, 2009.
6	The time is approximately 10:14 a.m. This
7	deposition is being held at the Center For
8	Oral History and Cultural Heritage at the
9	University of Southern Mississippi in
10	Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
11	This deposition is in reference to
12	the Engle Progeny Cases, Tobacco Litigation,
13	pertains to Stella Koballa and Robert
14	Koballa, Case Number 2007-33334-CICI; and
15	James Lewis, as Personal Representative of
16	the Estate of Rosemary Lewis, Case Number
17	2009-30058-CICI. And this is in the Court
18	of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, in and for
19	Volusia County, Florida, Civil Division.
20	The name of the witness is Dr. Louis M.
21	Kyriakoudes.
22	At this time, the attorneys will
23	identify themselves and the parties they
24	represent, after which time, our court
25	reporter, Monica Schroeder, will swear in
1	the witness and we can proceed.
2	MR. OGLE:
3	I'm Bill Ogle. I represent the
4	Stella Koballa case and the Estate of
5	Rosemary Lewi s.
6	MR. HENK:
7	Pete Henk for Philip Morris USA.
8	MS. LAWSON:
9	Christine Lawson on behalf of R.J.
10	Reynolds Tobacco Company.
11	MR. LITTLEFIELD:
12	Derek Littlefield on behalf of R.J.
13	Reynolds Tobacco Company.
14	MR. LEE:
15	And David Lee on behalf of the
16	plaintiffs, as well.
17	MS. LAWSON:
18	Before we begin your questioning,
19	let's put on the record what we were
20	discussing before about the video
21	deposition, if you don't mind.
22	It's our understanding that you plan
23	to bring Dr. Kyriakoudes live to trial?
24	MR. OGLE:
25	That is our plan. And we don't plan
1	to ask questions today other than as
2	necessary to clarify the record, if that
3	becomes important. We're not planning to
4	take a separate deposition today of Dr.
5	Kyriakoudes.
6	MR. HENK:
7	Thank you.
8	MS. LAWSON:
9	Anything to add?
10	DR. LOUIS KYRIAKOUDES
11	having been first duly sworn, was
12	examined and testified as follows:
13	EXAMINATION
14	BY MS. LAWSON:
15	Q. Good morning, Dr. Kyriakoudes. How
16	are you today?
17	A. Good morning.
18	Q. We've met before. My name is
19	Christine Lawson.
20	A. Yes. Good to see you.
21	Q. Good to see you. I represent R.J.
22	Reynolds Tobacco Company. I'm going to ask
23	you some questions today about the Koballa
24	case and the Lewis case.
25	Now, I know you've been deposed many
1	times, correct?
2	A. That's right.
3	Q. Just the ground rules. If you need
4	a break at any time, please say something.
5	And if any of my questions don't make sense,
6	also please let me know because if you
7	answer my question, I'll assume you
8	understood it. is that fair?
9	A. That's fair.
10	MS. LAWSON:
11	Let's start by marking your
12	subpoena. Let's mark this as Exhibit 1, if
13	we may.
14	(Exhibit 1 was marked.)
15	MS. LAWSON:
16	Q. I'm going to ask you to take a look
17	at that and see if you recognize it, please.
18	A. Yes. This is the last of many
19	deposition notices I received for this
20	deposition, so I have received that and I'm
21	familiar with it.
22	Q. Okay. Let's start with this one.
23	Attached to this was a Schedule A that asked
24	you to bring certain items with you. And
25	I'll ask you to go through that and tell me
1	if you brought any of those items with you.
2	A. I did. This is kind of in reverse
3	order. I have my CV, current CV. It's
4	current as of the middle of July. That CV
5	also lists prior testimony, which is also
6	listed on here. But the last couple of
7	depositions I've had last week are not
8	listed on there. I just haven't had time to
9	update it. But I think you would be
10	familiar with what's been going on in that
11	area.
12	Q. Other than missing depositions that
13	you haven't included on here, is it up to
14	date other than that?
15	A. it's up to date otherwise.
16	MS. LAWSON:
17	Let's go ahead and mark that.
18	(Exhibit 2 was marked.)
19	MS. LAWSON:
20	Q. Let me ask you a question. So you
21	gave me a CV. Do you have any materials
22	relating to plaintiff in this case? We'll
23	start with Ms. Koballa. Do you have any
24	materials relating to Ms. Koballa?
25	A. I was sent a set of -- a very large
1	set of materials, including lots of medical
2	records, which I think were sent to me by
3	mistake. And even if they were sent
4	intentionally, they're not anything that I
5	reviewed or need to review or, you know, are
6	relevant to my opinions. But I did bring
7	the e-mail correspondence related to that.
8	They were sent to me as e-mail attachments.
9	So you can kind of follow that process and
10	see what materials were sent to me.
11	Q. Okay. So you got medical records,
12	which you haven't reviewed.
13	A. Right.
14	Q. And you have e-mails, which you
15	brought copies of for me.
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. And can I see the e-mails that you
18	brought copies of?
19	A. Yes.
20	MR. OGLE:
21	We have some here, and there is a --
22	there is an issue in this related to one
23	document that was sent by mistake that was a
24	summary of the Koballa case written by some
25	of the attorneys, so we have not -- we're
1	not giving that to you.
2	MS. LAWSON:
3	Have you redacted the documents?
4	MR. OGLE:
5	Yes. That's not in here, correct?
6	THE WITNESS:
7	Right. All that's in the e-mail --
8	and I can represent it to you so that you
9	understand what's in there. The e-mail with
10	the attachment indicating the attachment,
11	and it says something like Koballa summary,
12	which is the document he's referring to.
13	MS. LAWSON:
14	And that's the document that's been
15	redacted; is that right?
16	MR. OGLE:
17	Well, we just didn't bring it.
18	A. And all that's in the e-mail is the
19	file name as an attachment. And then there
20	is a response from me saying, basically, you
21	know, I opened this document, looked at it,
22	immediately realized it was lawyer work
23	product and have not reviewed it.
24	It was sent to me by mistake, you
25	know. I don't want that. So there's my
1	response to the paralegal or secretary who I
2	had been dealing with in this case saying
3	that I had been sent inappropriate materials
4	and have not reviewed them.
5	Q. is that included in one of the
6	e-mails, your response back?
7	A. Yeah. All that is in there.
8	MS. LAWSON:
9	Can we mark those as the next
10	exhibit, please?
11	MR. OGLE:
12	Yes. it's a multi-page document.
13	(Exhibit 3 was marked.)
14	MS. LAWSON:
15	Q. Let me see those. Okay. Other than
16	medical records, the e-mails, any other
17	documents specific to the Koballa case that
18	you've reviewed?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. what else have you got?
21	A. One more. I actually -- I have just
22	a few kind of -- the briefest of all notes,
23	just to help me keep things straight in my
24	mind, because it was such a large number of
25	cases. That's your copy. I have a copy of
1	the same thing in front of me.
2	Q. So this looks like it has a note on
3	Mrs. Koballa and Ms. Hetzner and Lewis?
Page 11
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. So that's notes in three different
6	cases?
7	A. That's right.
8	MS. LAWSON:
9	Let's mark that as the next exhibit,
10	please.
11	(Exhibit 4 was marked.)
12	MS. LAWSON:
13	Q. Did you prepare any reports for the
14	Koballa case?
15	A. No, I have not.
16	Q. Do you know if any reports have been
17	prepared on your behalf for the Koballa
18	case?
19	A. No. No. I've not had any
20	discussions. There may be a disclosure, you
21	know, as part of the identification of
22	witnesses, but that wouldn't qualify as a
23	report.
24	Q. Have you seen any disclosure on your
25	behalf for the Koballa case?
1	A. No. There's a standard language
2	that I wrote some time ago that seems to be
3	circulating around and I've seen popping up.
4	Perhaps you will have that to show me later.
5	Q. You were also asked to bring all
6	documents, literature, deposition
Page 12
7	transcripts, data you relied upon to form
8	your opinions in this case. Do you have
9	that with you today?
10	A. Okay. Well, the plaintiff's
11	depositions, I've reviewed the ones that I
12	thought were most important. They're
13	indicated in there. I mean, I could give
14	you the files that I was sent, and I'll
15	happily do that at the break, but, you know,
16	in the interest of economy, I'm happy to do
17	that, but if -- I mean, the depositions are
18	the depositions. I don't have copies that
19	I've marked or made notes on, so there's
20	nothing unique that would reflect a
21	contribution that I offered to them, in
22	terms of the document. And they exist in
23	electronic form.
24	Q. So let me ask a question sort of
25	summarizing what you said and you tell me if
1	I got it right. For Koballa, you've
2	reviewed certain depositions?
3	A. That's right.
4	Q. And you have those only in
5	electronic format?
6	A. That's right.
7	Q. And you've taken no notes on them at
8	all?
9	A. Save for what I've brought you
Page 13
10	today.
11	Q. Which is Exhibit Number 4?
12	A. That's right.
13	Q. Do you remember which depositions
14	you reviewed for Koballa?
15	A. Well, I reviewed Ms. Koballa's
16	deposition, since she still was alive at
17	least at the point that she gave the
18	deposition. That's the one I relied on.
19	Q. Any others?
20	A. I skimmed through others, her
21	husband, but did not glean -- you know, but
22	found hers to be the one that I relied on.
23	Q. So that's the only one you'd be
24	relying upon for Koballa?
25	A. That's right.
1	Q. And how about the same question
2	related to the Lewis case? Did you review
3	any depositions for the Lewis case?
4	A. Well, similar. Her, Rosemary
5	Lewis's deposition, I read that.
6	Q. Anyone else's?
7	A. That's it, although I have others in
8	my file, but that's the one that I read.
9	Q. And would the situation with those
10	depositions be the same as in Koballa, you
11	received them in electronic format?
12	A. That's right. And you've got the
Page 14
13	e-mails indicating such in that earlier
14	exhibit.
15	Q. And you haven't made any notes or
16	any markings on any of the depositions in
17	the Lewis case?
18	A. No, save for what I've brought with
19	me today in Number 4.
20	Q. And Exhibit Number 4. Okay. Other
21	than the depositions, what documents are you
22	relying upon for your opinions in this case?
23	A. Well, as you know, there's a
24	significant portion, in fact, very
25	significant portion of my testimony that is
1	essentially generic and stays the same, and
2	I have many times supplied those documents.
3	in fact, I was told by a Shook, Hardy
4	lawyer, just last week, that I'm up to 11
5	boxes in their office.
6	So that universe of documents -- and
7	just for clarity, for your purpose,
8	documents used in the Hess and Sherman
9	cases, Ferlanti case, Campbell case, which,
10	of course, you were the deposer, and, you
11	know, the Barbanell case, which is -- and
12	that satisfies the item on the deposition
13	for the documents that I rely on, and also
14	the industry documents, which are included
15	in that set.
16	Q. Are you still doing research?
17	A. Yes. I'm always collecting stuff
18	and adding to my materials and indicate such
19	when I do that so to ease your ability to
20	make it easier for you to pick out what's
21	new.
22	I have nothing at this point new to
23	add from -- really from the Barbanell
24	deposition.
25	Q. Okay. So you haven't done any new
1	research and you have no new reliance
2	documents since Barbanell?
3	A. Yeah. That's correct. I was just
4	trying to check my --
5	Q. From the trial or from the
6	deposition?
7	A. They're kind of the same, so let me
8	just say the trial, since that happened more
9	recently, just to be more inclusive.
10	Q. Okay. Do you have any invoices for
11	the Koballa case?
12	A. No, I don't.
13	Q. Are you charging for your services
14	in the Koballa case?
15	A. I am.
16	Q. And how much are you charging?
17	A. The same rate that I have charged
18	previously, which is $400 an hour.
Page 16
19	Q. Have you charged a retainer in the
20	Koballa case?
21	A. I received a retainer for $3,500 to
22	cover a number of cases, including Koballa.
23	Q. Okay. How many cases did that
24	$3,500 retainer fee cover?
25	A. Basically, the Volusia County cases,
1	as I understood it to be. There's a set.
2	Four or five, I believe. But, in my mind,
3	they were for a consortium of attorneys that
4	were mounting cases in Volusia County and so
5	one retainer was enough. Because my policy
6	has always been to kind of -- that's simply
7	an advance on the hours I spend preparing
8	and consulting and doing the other work.
9	Q. Okay. Do you have any idea how many
10	cases was included in that consortium, I
11	think was the word that you used?
12	A. Well, yes. And I think it was about
13	four or five cases.
14	Q. Is that different than what you've
15	done in the past? Haven't you charged a
16	retainer, a $3,500 or I think it used to be
17	$3,200 retainer per case?
18	A. You know, I've never been strict
19	about that, it's -- and everybody does this
20	their own way. For me, the retainer is
21	really -- I call it a retainer, but to be
Page 17
22	more accurate, it's an advance from the
23	attorney to just -- to pay for the first
24	couple of days of work, really of, you know,
25	the first eight to nine hours of work on
1	their cases. And so it's not so much tied
2	to a case as it is to a contact with a law
3	f i rm.
4	Q. Okay. But it's not your intention,
5	then, to charge separate retainer fees for
6	Koballa and Lewis, and I think the cases
7	that we dropped from the deposition today,
8	Hibner and Humpal?
9	A. No. That is not my intention to do
10	that. I will just continue to bill them as
11	I accumulate hours of work.
12	Q. And how many hours do you think you
13	spent working on the Koballa case?
14	A. Koballa alone, I read Ms. Koballa's
15	deposition. That took me about an
16	hour-and-a-half.
17	Q. About $600 for Koballa?
18	A. Yeah. That would be fair.
19	Q. How about Lewis?
20	A. Lewis, I read her deposition, that
21	one was a little bit briefer. That might
22	have been -- it might not have been brief,
23	in terms of pages, but much of the
24	discussion was about health matters that
Page 18
25	were not relevant for my purposes, so that
1	one was less than an hour.
2	Q. So something under $400?
3	A. Yes. We'll say an hour, round it up
4	to an hour.
5	Q. And so $600 and $400, together,
6	would be $1,000?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. And so that $1,000 would be subsumed
9	within the $3,500 retainer?
10	A. That's right.
11	Q. And have you already been paid that
12	$3,500 retainer?
13	A. I was. Yes. I did receive that.
14	Q. And do you know who paid you that
15	$3,500 retainer?
16	A. I can get that for you today because
17	I think I have a letter on my desk, which I
18	actually should give you, I'm just
19	remembering now, that came with the check.
20	Q. That came with the check. Okay.
21	A. And I have that letter and that just
22	occurred to me.
23	Q. Do you remember who first contacted
24	you about the Volusia County cases?
25	A. It was Mr. Lee, who is here in this
1	room.
2	Q. when he contacted you, what did he
3	tell you about the cases?
4	A. He said that there was a set of
5	Engle progeny cases coming to trial, you
6	know, in the Daytona Beach area, and asked
7	if I would be interested in serving as an
8	expert witness on those cases. And I said,
9	sure, you know, just -- you know, he said
10	four or five, you know, that were in their
11	first kind of go around. And that --
12	I said, well, you know, send me a
13	retainer. I explained my retainer policy,
14	which I've explained to you, told him the
15	same thing. And when they get ready to
16	schedule depositions -- I was pretty busy at
17	the time. He called me in June, late June.
18	I was pretty busy at the time, so I didn't
19	think much about that particular set of
20	work, but I said, when you are ready for
21	things to start happening, you know,
22	depositions and all that, contact me and
23	I'll begin working on it.
24	Q. Okay. Other than that time when Mr.
25	Lee contacted you in late June, have you
1	spoken with the plaintiff's attorneys about
2	these cases, about Koballa and Lewis?
3	A. I had a nice conversation with Mr.
4	Ogle, who I met this morning, in the 20
5	minutes before the deposition started.
6	That's it.
7	Q. And that's it?
8	A. Yes. Not much.
9	MS. LAWSON:
10	Let's mark this as the next exhibit.
11	(Exhibit 5 was marked.)
12	MS. LAWSON:
13	Q. Professor, I'm going to show you the
14	plaintiff's expert's disclosures in the
15	Koballa case, and I will direct you more
16	specifically, if I don't lose my place
17	again, to Page 13, and ask you to take a
18	look at that and see if that looks familiar
19	to you.
20	A. This looks very familiar to me.
21	Q. Okay, is that language you,
22	yourself, wrote?
23	A. Yes. Some time ago, when -- I
24	believe when we were either preparing -- I
25	think we were preparing for the generic
1	deposition that was taken in January or the
2	Martin case. I'm pretty sure it was the
3	generic deposition. I wrote this, sent it
4	to Matt Schultz, an attorney with the Levin
5	firm, and batted it back and forth. And
6	then this is the boilerplate language that
7	I've seen reproduced many times in similar
8	documents.
9	Q. Now, you said you and Matt Schultz
10	batted that back and forth, what do you
11	mean by that?
12	A. Well, I sent it to him. He wanted
13	me to put together a paragraph on what I
14	testified on, and then he said, well, you
15	know, are there other areas you can testify
16	on? And I said, well, you know, this is how
17	I divide it and so I added some material to
18	it. That's it.
19	Q. The language and the words used in
20	there, are those your words or are those Mr.
21	Schultz's words or a combination of the two?
22	A. No. These are my words. All of
23	these are my words.
24	Q. Did Mr. Schultz suggest that you
25	make any changes to how you worded it?
1	A. Not to the wording. He wanted to --
2	the item in question is this last -- second
3	to last paragraph, here.
4	Q. The paragraph that reads, "Dr.
5	Kyriakoudes may also be called to discuss
6	the historical issues discussed above as
7	they relate and apply to plaintiff-specific
8	locales, though such testimony is most
9	likely to be elicited by way of rebuttal, if
10	at all."
11	A. Yeah. He suggested that. He just
12	said that that might be -- you know, kind of
13	from a legal language standpoint, he wanted
14	to put that in there. I agreed with that
15	language. It's not substantive, in my mind,
16	on the issue of my opinions. It's just
17	basically what he might ask me to do. So --
18	But this portion, right here, I
19	wrote, the first -- and when I say "portion,
20	right here," I'm referring to Paragraph 1.
21	Q. Paragraph 1 of your disclosure?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And then it was Paragraph 2 that you
24	put in there at the request of Mr. Schultz?
25	A. That's right.
1	Q. Do you know why Mr. Schultz wanted
2	that in there?
3	A. Yes. Because he might want me to
4	discuss specific locales and might want to
5	bring me back as a rebuttal witness. And I
6	said, that's fine.
7	Q. And what did you understand about
8	providing testimony about plaintiff-specific
9	locales? what did you understand that to
10	be?
11	A. The history of, you know, kind of
12	general historical discussions of particular
13	places, you know, kind of time context.
14	Q. Anything else?
15	A. That's it.
16	MS. LAWSON:
17	Okay. And let's mark as the next
18	exhibit the Lewis expert disclosure.
19	(Exhibit 6 was marked.)
20	MS. LAWSON:
21	Q. We have marked as Exhibit 6 the
22	expert -- the plaintiff's expert disclosure
23	in Lewis, and I'll ask you to take a look at
24	that, it appeared, to me, to be identical
25	to Koballa, but tell me if you agree with
1	that.
2	A. it appears, to me, to be a cut and
3	paste job, as they say, yes, identical.
4	Q. Do you know when the expert
5	disclosures in either Koballa or Lewis were
6	submitted?
7	A. No, although this one says stamped
8	June 8th, 2009. But without having looked
9	at that stamp, I wouldn't have known the
10	answer to that question.
11	Q. Okay. I think you told me a little
12	bit earlier that you spoke with Mr. Lee
13	first about the Volusia County cases in late
14	June; is that right?
15	A. That's what I'm thinking, yes, but
16	let me get that letter. That might --
17	because that letter, with the payment, would
18	indicate a period after the discussion.
19	Q. Okay.
20	A. It was not a long conversation, so I
21	don't have a strong recollection of what it
22	was. And as you well know, I'm involved in
23	a lot of cases, so I'm not real good about
24	keeping them all straight in my head.
25	Q. Sitting here today, do you have any
1	recollection as to whether you spoke to Mr.
2	Lee prior to June 4th?
3	A. I can't remember. And, again, the
4	discussion was not much more than an
5	introduction. We have some cases coming up
6	in Volusia County, Florida, would you be
7	interested, yes.
8	Q. You remember earlier this year, I
9	think it was back in late January, you gave
10	a trial preservation deposition on generic
11	issues?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Do you recall that?
14	A. I do.
15	Q. Do you plan to offer any opinions in
16	either Koballa or Lewis that are different
17	than the opinions you offered in that
18	deposition?
19	A. Not different. I mean, I haven't
20	changed my view on the issues that I
21	discussed in that trial preservation
22	deposition. I've had no change in my view
23	on those.
24	Just for clarity sake, you know, I
25	may offer opinions about a wider range of
1	subjects because, as you recall, that
2	particular trial preservation deposition
3	only dealt with one thread or a small set of
4	threads of the scope of testimony that I've
5	given in the past and in the area in which
6	I'm an expert.
7	Q. Well, sitting here today, can you
8	tell me what opinions you plan to offer --
9	we'll start with Koballa, in Koballa, that
10	are beyond what was offered in that trial
11	preservation deposition?
12	A. Sure. I may be asked -- of course,
13	it all depends on what questions I'm asked
14	at the trial. But I may be asked questions
15	about, you know, the rise of smoking and the
16	rise of the cigarette culture, on the
17	history of cigarette advertising and
18	marketing, and the history of public
19	knowledge and understanding of the risks of
20	smoking, which, as I recall, were not -- I
21	can't remember if I didn't talk about those
22	at all, but they weren't a major foci of
23	that particular round of questions.
24	Q. I think we discussed this earlier,
25	but are you planning to come live to the
1	Koballa trial?
2	A. Yes. That's -- in my discussions
3	with the attorneys, that's the
4	understanding, and my intention is to come
5	in person.
6	Q. Okay. Now, you just recently
7	testified in a couple of cases in Pensacola;
8	is that right?
9	A. Yes. In July and then prior to that
10	i n May.
11	Q. And do you remember showing the
12	jury, in both of those cases, a number of
13	advertisements?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Cigarette advertisements. Do you
16	plan to do that in the Koballa case?
17	A. I may, yes. I think that's -- yes.
18	I -- right now, that's my intention. And
19	just so that you are clear on that, you
20	know, I have a large number of
21	advertisements in my reliance documents.
22	I've looked at a large number of
23	advertisements in my research. But as a
24	practical matter, because of the high
25	quality of the scans, just from an issue of
1	representation, the illustrations in the Not
2	a Cough in a Carload on-line museum -- which
3	you may be familiar with that. If not, I
4	can give you the exact URL.
5	Q. Why don't you say it for the record.
6	A. Yes. It's an on-line museum of
7	cigarette advertising sponsored by the
8	Stanford university School of Medicine, a
9	gentleman by the name of Robert Jackler, and
10	it's called Not a Cough in a Carload. And
11	they're particularly high-quality scans,
12	just the mechanical reproduction of
13	documents. And so I've been relying on
14	that, not for any of the original research,
15	because I've seen all of those ads in other
16	context, but because of the quality of the
17	advertisements.
18	And just to give you an example, you
19	know, when I began this, I would take the
20	big Life Magazine volumes, and that's a
21	large folio sized, and put them on the
22	photocopier, black and white and, you know,
23	my chicken scratch on the bottom. So these
24	just look better and more realistic and more
25	authentic to the original.
1	Q. Do you know which advertisements you
2	plan to use for the Koballa case?
3	A. Well, Ms. Koballa was a Lucky Strike
4	smoker when she began smoking in the early
5	1950s, so I would, in particular, draw upon
6	those advertisements from that time period.
7	And just so you will -- so that you
8	have a good idea of what my thoughts are,
9	the advertising, over the course of her
10	life, even when she's a pre-smoker, helped
11	shape people of her generation's
12	understanding of the cigarette. I'm not
13	going to connect an ad to her specifically
14	-- and you can ask me that later -- but I
15	will talk about the advertising in the late
16	'20s and the 1930s, she was born in '33, and
17	deal with the various Lucky Strike
18	campaigns.
19	You know, if asked, I would like to
20	show some of the commercials, you know, the
21	televised commercials from Lucky Strike from
22	that time period.
23	Q. Okay. Any particular Lucky Strike
24	advertisements you have in mind to use?
25	A. Well, sure. The Toasted For Your
1	Throat Protection from the 1930s. I would
2	like to start, actually, with the
3	intelligence, famous 1928 intelligence
4	advertisement, which deals with women
5	smoking and links it to women's autonomy in
6	society. Also show the Reach for a Lucky
7	instead of a Sweet campaign. Those are
8	good.
9	Q. And what time period would that be?
10	A. Well, those begin in 1928 and into
11	the 1930s. And then in the 1940s and 1950s
12	deal with the Be Happy, Go Lucky campaign.
13	Those are good. Very arresting visual
14	images.
15	And then, of course, work in the
16	Herbert Tarrington brand, because there's
17	apparently some evidence that she smoked
18	that brand, as well.
19	Q. And what ads for Tarrington do you
20	have in mind?
21	A. There's some early '50s ads for the
22	Tarrington brand about filters and alike.
23	I'm not recalling the exact ones. I'll have
24	to go back to my notes. Those are all in my
25	files, though.
1	Q. Let me go back and ask you about
2	some of the Lucky Strikes ads. You
3	mentioned, I think, the 1928 intelligence
Page 30
4	ad.
5	A. '28 or '29, yeah.
6	Q. So late 1920s. Do you know which
7	publications that showed up in?
8	A. My copy is from Literary Digest.
9	Q. Do you know if it was in any other
10	publications?
11	A. As I sit here, no, I don't know. I
12	know it was at least in Literary Digest.
13	Q. How about the Toasted For Your
14	Throat, was that one of the ones you told me
15	about?
16	A. Toasted For Your Throat Protection.
17	Q. For Your Throat Protection. Do you
18	know where those ads were published?
19	A. Yes. Life Magazine. You also find
20	them in Time Magazine in the 1930s. It's
21	also in the women's magazines, Good
22	Housekeeping, Ladies Home Journal, magazines
23	like that. Saturday Evening Post carried
24	that campaign. That one was very widely
25	disseminated.
1	Q. How about the Be Happy, Go Lucky, do
2	you know where that was published?
3	A. The same. The similar answer to the
4	Toasted For Your Throat Protection. You
5	would find that in Life Magazine, the
6	women's magazines, Time.
7	Q. How about Reach For Lucky instead of
8	a Sweet, where was that published?
9	A. Reach for Lucky is, you know -- and
10	billboards, let's not forget billboards, at
11	least for that campaign, I've got
12	affirmative billboard data for that. The
13	others are probably on billboards, but I
14	just don't have -- have that data at hand.
15	And then the major -- the major
16	magazines of the day, the Reach For Lucky
17	campaign, that one, '28, '29, to the early
18	'30s. Also hand bills, individual
19	publications that were distributed, booklets
20	and the like.
21	Q. Now, you said just a minute ago you
22	had data on billboards, what data is that?
23	A. Oh, just the representation of
24	billboards. Yes, a good point. At least at
25	this point in time, I don't have at hand
1	like the receipts or kind of hardcore site
2	location stuff. It may be in there, but I
3	just haven't looked at that.
4	Q. What you are relying upon to say
5	that the Reach For Lucky instead of a Sweet
6	that appeared on the billboards, is that in
7	your reliance materials that we've already
8	discussed that would be current through
9	Barbanell?
10	A. I don't know if I -- you know, I
11	don't save everything that I've looked at.
12	There are billboard mockups in the files of
13	the American Tobacco Company that indicate
14	that they're used at billboards. I'm not
15	sure if they're in the reliance documents.
16	Q. Would you mind checking for me, if
17	you get a chance?
18	A. No, I wouldn't mind checking. Yes.
19	I would check for you.
20	Q. I would appreciate that because I
21	would like to know if they are in the
22	reliance materials that you already have.
23	Do you know, based on the
24	information you already have, where the
25	billboards were located that had that
1	particular advertisement on it?
2	A. No. I don't know. I'm writing on
3	this, just for the record, just because
4	you've asked me and it will help me
5	remember.
6	Q. That's our Exhibit Number 4, I
7	think.
8	A. Yes. But you've got one that's
9	already been stamped.
10	Q. Okay. That's fine. How about are
11	those all of the advertisements that you
12	were planning on relying upon for Koballa
Page 33
13	and for your opinions in Koballa regarding
14	advertisements?
15	A. I mean, I may show others. There's
16	so many advertisements. The advertising
17	record is rich. There's Bel air
18	advertisements. I've got some of those in
19	my reliance documents. She also smoked
20	Basic. I don't really have many Basic ads.
21	Basic is kind of a discount brand.
22	Q. What Belair ads do you have that you
23	are thinking of using?
24	A. I can't think of any right now.
25	Belair is a less widely used brand, it
1	hasn't really been one that I've been asked
2	about much in the past, so, you know, my
3	typical response would be to see what I have
4	in my reliance documents, and if I don't
5	have anything there, you know, the on-line
6	databases of advertisements are so rich and
7	they're at hand so they can easily be
8	acquired.
9	Q. And the Belair advertisements that
10	you have, do you know where they were
11	published?
12	A. The stuff in my reliance documents
13	generally has where it's been published.
14	And generally, if you read the file name,
15	the file name indicates where it was
Page 34
16	published.
17	Q. Which you don't have any information
18	other than that or databases other than that
19	regarding where the Bel air ads would have
20	been published?
21	A. No, not right now, I don't.
22	Q. Okay. Are you creating some?
23	A. No. I'm not -- no, I'm not. I
24	mean, there's so -- 48 million pages in the
25	industry archives. It's the richest
1	historical archive in the United States
2	right now, for cigarettes and also for
3	things not related to cigarettes, you know,
4	20th Century American life.
5	So if I'm asked a question, you
6	know, I may go to those documents, and if I
7	find a relevant document, I may incorporate
8	that into my presentation. But right now, I
9	haven't done that.
10	Q. Okay. Well, I would ask if you come
11	up with any new documents that you might
12	want to use with regard to Koballa, that you
13	let us know.
14	A. Oh, yes. Yes. I'm not inclined to,
15	nor am I allowed to pop new things on you
16	guys, which is not fair.
17	Q. Right. I just want to understand
18	what you have now and if you are planning on
Page 35
19	-- well, are you planning on doing
20	additional research for Koballa?
21	A. The one -- a couple of things I'm
22	thinking about. I do have, through the
23	Newspaperarchive.com which is an on-line
24	archive to which I subscribe for newspapers,
25	some newspapers from the region in which she
1	grew up in, in her earliest life, which
2	would be the Fayette County, Pennsylvania
3	region, the bituminous iron, coal range
4	area.
5	And I haven't had time, but I intend
6	to and will supply to you all copies that I
7	discover in this research, just some basic
8	newspaper research on the issue of
9	cigarettes and smoking during the period of
10	her lifetime.
11	Q. where did you get these newspapers?
12	A. Oh, the Newspaperarchive.com is a
13	subscription service. It's largely
14	comprised of smaller newspapers, or let me
15	be more accurate, small town newspapers.
16	It's, in that regard, different than The New
17	York Times, Washington Post ProQuest
18	archive, which covers these major, major
19	dailies.
20	So when relevant, I consult that, as
21	well, and have done that in the past and
Page 36
22	have included that in my reliance documents.
23	Q. Okay. You haven't done it yet for
24	Koballa?
25	A. No, I haven't. Koballa is -- you
1	know, the materials for Koballa came to me
2	fairly recently, and I've been, with the
3	beginning of the semester, a little
4	stretched for time.
5	But, you know, I will happily --
6	one, of course, I will give you anything I
7	rely upon without question, but happily make
8	myself available to you if you should feel
9	the need to ask me questions about it.
10	Q. Okay, when did you get the
11	materials relevant to Koballa; do you
12	remember?
13	A. If you show me the e-mails, I'll
14	tell you exactly when.
15	Q. Okay. You can, of course, refer to
16	that.
17	A. Yeah. These e-mails are all dated
18	the 18th -- around the 18th of August and
19	onward, so that would be, I guess, last
20	week.
21	Q. Would it be fair to say that you are
22	planning on doing some research in
23	Newspaperarchive.com for the Koballa case?
24	A. Yes. That would be accurate and
Page 37
1	Q. And you are going to be looking for
2	newspaper articles relevant to smoking and
3	health; is that correct?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Anything, in particular, you are
6	going to look for?
7	A. Well, it's a key word searching
8	item, so I will probably put "cigarette" in,
9	and also "smoking" and then see how many
10	results I come up with. If it's
11	overwhelming, like, you know, 20,000, I'll
12	narrow it down with key words like "cancer,"
13	"disease" or something like that. But I'll
14	start broadly and only narrow it down if I
15	have to due to inability to expeditiously
16	review the material.
17	Q. Okay. Any particular time period
18	you plan on using with your search
19	parameters for Koballa?
20	A. Well, for Koballa, the Pennsylvania
21	portion of her life, which would be from her
22	birth, around 1933. I may go back a few
23	years prior to that and take that to when I
24	believe it's in the mid '50s or so that -- I
25	forget the exact year she moves away, but
1	around that time. And I would confirm that
2	date in the deposition.
3	Q. So right now, sitting here, you are
4	thinking early 1930s to mid 1950s for the
5	Pennsylvania portion?
6	A. That's right.
7	Q. Any particular newspapers you are
8	planning on looking at?
9	A. I'll look for the ones from that
10	region that are in the Newspaperarchive.com
11	database and I'm not recalling right now
12	which ones they have in there.
13	Q. Now let's switch to Lewis, if we
14	might.
15	A. Sure.
16	Q. Any particular advertisements that
17	you are planning to use for your opinions in
18	Lewi s?
19	A. For Lewis, you know, she's a later
20	generation, so she's somebody who began
21	smoking, really in the late '50s, early
22	'60s, that time period. So for that, I'll
23	-- I mean, I haven't thought about it in too
24	much detail and will talk with the
25	attorneys, but my hope is that I would show
1	ads from the mid '50s, early '50s onward.
2	We're in the television era, so we've got
3	lots of commercials that we can rely on.
4	My position has been that while
5	people smoke their various brands, and some
6	people smoke a small population of brands,
7	others smoke a larger variety of brands.
8	And generally, and I've said this many
9	times, cigarette advertising, first and
10	foremost, shapes expectations about the
11	category of the cigarette.
12	And particularly when we deal with
13	some of the themes that I've developed in my
14	discussions on the stand in which I address
15	the role of the cigarette in American
16	culture, these kind of broader, more general
17	aspects to smoking, you know, smoking
18	etiquette, as it's portrayed in commercials,
19	the acceptability of smoking, the social
20	situations of smoking, the delights and
21	wonders of smoking, as it's portrayed in the
22	commercials, to a significant degree, it's a
23	higher level than any particular brand. The
24	ads do advertise a particular brand and
25	that's part of it, but they also are a major
1	vector of shaping American culture, in terms
2	of people's attitudes about smoking,
3	generally.
4	Q. Well, sitting here today, is it fair
5	to say that you don't know which ads that
6	you would be using to support your opinions
7	in the Lewis case?
8	A. Right. I haven't sat down and kind
9	of come up with a set. But they would be
10	within the universe of materials that I've
11	talked about in the past.
12	Q. Is there any other research, other
13	than identifying the advertisements, like we
14	just discussed about, that you plan on doing
15	for the Lewis case?
16	A. No. I, in the past, reviewed --
17	have reviewed New York area newspapers. I'm
18	well familiar with the area that she grew up
19	in, both through research and personal
20	experience. So I feel pretty good about
21	that, that case.
22	Q. And the specific New York newspaper
23	you looked at is New York Times; is that
24	right?
25	A. Yes. I, once upon a time, collected
1	a set of materials related to Newsweek. I
2	no longer have those. They were -- I had
3	those only in paper form and they got
4	ruined.
5	Q. Okay. So it would be fair to say
6	you are not going to be using Newsweek for
7	any of your opinions?
8	A. Right. I don't intend to go back to
9	Newsweek for this. I mean, I have looked at
10	the paper, but they were flooded, so I don't
11	have -- no longer have those.
12	Q. Okay. Let me go back, if I can, for
13	one minute. You told me for the Koballa
14	case, you were planning to go to
15	Newspaperarchive.com and do the research in
16	the Pennsylvania newspapers. Why?
17	A. Local flavor. The materials are
18	available. You know, I mean, the reality
19	is, is that what you pull up in these papers
20	are AP stories, so there's nothing -- most
21	of the tobacco-related content is not
22	site-specific, and my experience has been
23	there's not much variation amongst these
24	papers. The large, big city dailies tend to
25	be similar. Smaller papers, some different
1	variation, largely stemming from the fact
2	that smaller papers simply reprint the AP or
3	UPI or New York Times news service or
4	whatever primary and secondary news services
5	that they subscribe to.
6	But this is available and would not
7	be a huge investment in time. And so I
8	might come up with some examples and that
9	would be really all the reason to do it.
10	Q. Are you going to be charging Mr.
11	Ogle for your time that you spend looking
12	for these newspapers?
13	A. I've maintained a practice which I
14	still stick to, for good or bad, that I
15	don't charge for primary source research.
16	So I actually won't be charging for that.
17	You know, when I talk to him on the phone
18	and when I, you know -- I mean, if I happen
19	to hire someone to do it, then I will charge
20	him for the research assistant's time and
21	any time I might spend working with the
22	research assistant or training or reviewing
23	his materials. But for actually doing the
24	research, I just always have done that, and
25	that's been something that is a policy that
1	I've maintained, really, since almost from
2	the beginning of this.
3	Q. whose idea was it for you to do this
4	research in Newspaperarchives.com? was it
5	yours?
6	A. Yes. It's mine. I've had
7	essentially no substantive discussions about
8	these cases with the attorneys.
9	Q. You've testified in other cases that
10	you really don't need to look at local
11	newspapers. Do you remember that?
12	A. Right.
13	Q. What's the difference? Why are you
14	looking at local newspapers now?
15	A. Mostly because you guys keep harping
16	on it. You really don't need to look at the
17	local papers. You know, the AP wire stories
18	really cover it. You know, if you write --
19	if you were to write the AP news service and
20	say, you know, I'm interested in looking at
21	your historical files of stories, do you
22	know what they will tell you? They'll say,
23	go to Newspaperarchive.com. That's where we
24	have our backlogs of files.
25	And so it's really something that is
1	not necessary, it's something that, because
2	I get asked about it by you guys time in and
3	time again and because it's not a
4	significant investment of time, I can make a
5	--I'll research it.
6	Q. Okay. I think you told me earlier
7	that you were looking at it because it
8	provided local flavor; is that right?
9	A. Well, I mean, only to the -- not
10	really. I mean, that was kind of a flippant
11	remark. All I'm going to be pulling up are
12	AP stories, almost, I guarantee. That's
13	been my experience. Particularly for the
14	modern period, post World War II. They're
15	going to be the wire services.
16	Q. Do you think that there might be
17	some articles in there that are not the AP
18	and UPI stories?
19	A. Well, if there are local articles,
20	they're going to be of the type that you
21	find everywhere. Say, for example, it may
22	be a case that you find in there in the
23	1960s that a local doctor is going to give a
24	talk or the local branch of the American
25	Cancer Society might run an educational
1	program. By the 1960s, they were doing that
2	all over the country.
3	So, you know, it's attention between
4	what's unique and what's generalizable.
5	while, sure, that particular doctor is
6	unique, but that activity is fairly
7	generalized.
8	Well, I said this in Campbell, we
9	had this discussion previously. You know,
10	for my opinions and for understanding the
11	broad contours of the smoking and health
12	debate and the general development of
13	America's cigarette culture, it's really not
14	essential for my opinions.
15	Q. Well, then why do it?
16	A. Because it's available, and won't
17	take me very long, and for the reasons that
18	I just mentioned. You guys are always
19	asking me about it.
20	Q. Are you planning on doing it for
21	cases other than Koballa?
22	A. I don't know. I mean, that's what
23	I'm working on now, so I haven't thought
24	about other cases.
25	Q. Tell me what you know about Mrs.
1	Koballa.
2	A. Well, she's from kind of the
3	southwestern corner of Pennsylvania. She
4	was born and raised there, kind of an
5	industrial region, coal mining and
6	steel-making area, really a fascinating
7	place, has a rich history going back to Fort
8	Necessity, and George Washington's one big
9	defeat, which helped spark the French and
10	Indian war in the Colonial period.
11	She was raised there. She moved
12	around a little bit, but within a fairly
13	constrained circuit, got married, moved to
14	Alabama, then lived in Cleveland, then moved
15	to Florida, you know, as part of her adult
16	1i fe.
17	Q. Okay. And I think you've told me
18	already, but do you remember when she was
19	born?
20	A. 1933.
21	Q. Do you remember the town she was
22	born?
23	A. Tower Hill. Is that right? Is that
24	where she was born? I thought there was a
25	mention of Tower Hill or Brownsville, one of
1	these fairly small places in this area.
2	MR. HENK:
3	I don't mean to interrupt, but could
4	we have you flip the paper over and just
5	answer the questions?
6	THE WITNESS:
7	Why?
8	MR. HENK:
9	well, because we're not here to test
10	your memory of what's on a document. We are
11	here to have you answer questions. Do you
12	have an objection to that? if you can't
13	answer them without referring to the
14	document, then I'd just like the record to
15	reflect that.
16	THE WITNESS:
17	I've -- you know, I've prepared for
18	many -- you know, initially was preparing
19	for what I thought might be four different
20	cases in this deposition, right?
21	MR. OGLE:
22	Right.
23	THE WITNESS:
24	And I simply typed up some notes,
25	which I shared with you, and, in fact,
1	brought you a copy as to help spark the
2	memory.
3	I'm not sure that this is a memory
4	test. Is it?
5	MR. HENK:
6	Well, I agree that it's difficult to
7	keep track of four plaintiffs' facts.
8	That's why I have notes, and, fortunately,
9	as a lawyer, I get to use them. But in a
10	trial or in a deposition, you are here to
11	answer questions, and if you can't answer
12	the questions without refreshing your
13	recollection, that's fine. But we're
14	entitled to know that.
15	THE WITNESS:
16	It's on your lap.
17	MR. OGLE:
18	Well, he's also entitled to refer to
19	notes, if he wishes to. There's no question
20	about that.
21	MR. HENK:
22	Well, if we want to have the record
23	reflect that he can't answer case-specific
24	facts without referring to notes, I'm fine
25	with that. As long as the record reflects
1	that, then he can look at his notes.
2	MR. OGLE:
3	Well, I don't think the record has
4	to reflect that at all. if he wants to
5	refer to his notes, he's entitled to it. if
6	you want to say, well, do you know without
7	looking at his notes, you can ask him that
8	way, as well. But he's entitled to have his
9	notes. Here's his notes. You can make it
10	an exhibit to the deposition, if you like.
11	MS. LAWSON:
12	It's already --
13	MR. OGLE:
14	it's already an exhibit, so --
15	MR. HENK:
16	it's the same.
17	A. It reminds me of a story. It may be
18	a pockerful, but the great German conductor,
19	Fritz Reiner, was asked, "Dr. Reiner, you
20	don't conduct from memory. You use a
21	score." "Well, I don't need to. I know how
22	to read music."
23	That's why we have writing.
24	MS. LAWSON:
25	Q. And for purposes of the question --
1	and I will let you refer to your notes, if
2	you need to. I think, in deference to what
3	Mr. Henk is asking, let's start. If you
Page 49
4	need the notes, please say something.
5	A. Sure.
6	Q. And, otherwise, we'll just leave
7	them turned over. Is that satisfactory?
8	MR. HENK:
9	That would be great.
10	MS. LAWSON:
11	Q. would that be okay?
12	A. Sure.
13	Q. Have you ever been to the town where
14	Mrs. Koballa was born?
15	A. Well, I'm not remembering exactly
16	which town. I've been to that area,
17	although not in connection with any research
18	for this case.
19	Some years ago, I had occasion to
20	visit Carnegie, Pennsylvania, and then had
21	to go to Washington, so I took the
22	interstate down to U.S. 40, which is the old
23	national road, and kind of took my time,
24	simply because that area figures so
25	prominently in American history, and
1	basically took that to Maryland, and then
2	from Maryland took the interstate into D.C.
3	Q. Do you know what newspapers were
4	circulated in the town in which Ms. Koballa
5	grew up?
6	A. No. I don't know the name of the
Page 50
7	specific papers, with notes or without them.
8	Q. Okay. That's fine. You also had
9	mentioned to me that you were aware that
10	Mrs. Koballa had lived in Alabama.
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And do you know when she lived
13	there?
14	A. She moves there in the '50s, I guess
15	after she got married.
16	Q. Do you know how long she lives
17	there?
18	A. It was not long. I forget the exact
19	number of years, it was a brief period of
20	time and then they moved on.
21	Q. Do you know any of the newspapers
22	that were circulating in the area of Alabama
23	where she lived while she was there?
24	A. Well, that would be The Montgomery
25	Advertiser.
1	Q. Have you reviewed The Montgomery
2	Advertiser?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Do you have any intention to do so?
5	A. No.
6	Q. And I think you told me they moved
7	on after a short time in Alabama. And where
8	did they move to?
9	A. I believe then they moved to -- I'm
Page 51
10	sorry, Cleveland for a period of time.
11	Q. Do you know the papers that were
12	circulating in Cleveland during the time
13	period she lived there?
14	A. Well, the principal paper in
15	Cleveland -- I'm sure there's others, but
16	the principal paper is The Plain Dealer.
17	Q. Have you ever reviewed The Plain
18	Dealer?
19	A. No. No.
20	Q. Do you have any intention of doing
21	so?
22	A. No. I've reviewed The Chicago
23	Tribune extensively, and that's a good
24	representation of kind of Midwestern news
25	coverage on this issue.
1	Q. when did you review The Chicago
2	Tribune?
3	A. I've done it over a long period of
4	time. You know, you could look in my
5	reliance documents and look at the dates of
6	the files to have a more accurate
7	representation of that, but some of the
8	older Chicago -- older, in terms of in my
9	archive, entered into my archive would be --
10	I think I've been entered in maybe as much
11	as five or six years ago, and I've had
12	occasion to go back to that paper some -- I
Page 52
13	did this past spring.
14	Q. Okay. All of your Chicago Tribune
15	materials, would they be in the reliance
16	documents that would be current through
17	Barbanell?
18	A. Yes. That's true.
19	Q. Do you plan on doing any further
20	research in The Chicago Tribune for this
21	case?
22	A. No.
23	Q. Let me ask you, when you go to
24	tobacco -- or, excuse me,
25	Newspaperarchives.com, and you said you
1	would use the key word "cigarette" and
2	"smoking," that's what you would start with?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. Would you be looking for articles
5	then on smoking and health?
6	A. Yes. But also advertisements. Also
7	broader than smoking and health, I'm
8	interested in stories that discuss the kind
9	of social rituals of smoking.
10	Q. And explain what you mean by that.
11	A. Well, you know, people will discuss
12	cigarettes and tobacco in a context that are
13	different than -- or not relevant to, say,
14	for example, the cancer scare of the 1950s.
15	They may talk about just, you know, smoking,
Page 53
16	just as itself, either as a primary point in
17	the story or incidental. But you could
18	learn rituals of smoking, you know, what was
19	acceptable to smoke, where, when, that kind
20	of thing.
21	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Koballa's family
22	subscribed to any newspapers while she was
23	living in Pennsylvania?
24	A. I'm not recalling either way. If
25	she discussed it in her deposition, it
1	didn't stand out. It didn't stick in my
2	brain.
3	Q. Is it relevant to any of your
4	opinions in this case whether she subscribed
5	to newspapers?
6	A. No. I mean, as I've, you know, done
7	in previous cases, I'm not going to, you
8	know, offer a biography of Mrs. Koballa.
9	You know, I'll be consistent in that area.
10	I'm not going to say what she affirmatively
11	knew or didn't know because there's really
12	not enough evidence for me to make that
13	judgment. I can talk about general
14	historical trends, but not her as an
15	individual.
16	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Koballa's family
17	subscribed to any newspapers while she was
18	living in Alabama?
19	A. They may have mentioned that, but
20	I'm not recalling it.
21	Q. Okay. Is it relevant to your
22	opinion if she did?
23	A. No.
24	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa
25	subscribed to any newspapers while she was
1	living in Cleveland?
2	A. She might mention that she got The
3	Plain Dealer, but that's not relevant to my
4	opinion in any case.
5	Q. Okay. Do you know if Ms. Koballa
6	lived anywhere other than -- or after
7	Cleveland?
8	A. Well, she went to Florida.
9	Q. And do you know where she moved to?
10	A. She lived in a couple of places in
11	Florida, but I'm not remembering the
12	specific locales.
13	Q. Have you ever reviewed any
14	newspapers from Volusia County, Florida?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Have you ever been to Volusia
17	County, Florida?
18	A. I have been to Daytona Beach. A lot
19	of Greeks down there.
20	Q. For research or for entertainment?
21	A. I've been there for entertainment,
Page 55
22	to visit family, but I've never been there
23	for research.
24	Q. Is it fair to say you haven't
25	researched any newspapers in Volusia County?
1	A. That's fair.
2	Q. Do you know the names of any of the
3	newspapers in Volusia County?
4	A. I'm not recalling right now the
5	Daytona paper. I'm not recalling the exact
6	name.
7	Q. Okay. Do you intend to use any
8	articles from The New York Times to support
9	your opinions in the Koballa case?
10	A. I might, you know, as examples of
11	national coverage of smoking and health,
12	perhaps, I might.
13	Q. Any particular articles you have in
14	mi nd?
15	A. I have a large number in my files,
16	which you, of course, have.
17	Q. Any particular ones stick out?
18	A. What are my favorites? I don't
19	know. None stick out right now. I've --
20	what did I use in the last couple of trials?
21	I can't even remember which ones I chose for
22	that one.
23	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa ever read
24	The New York Times?
25	A. I don't know either way, no.
1	Q. Now, are there any magazine articles
2	that you are intending to use to support
3	your opinions in this case? And I mean
4	Koballa.
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Which ones?
7	A. There's lots of good stuff from the
8	magazines. I'll probably show the December
9	1953 Life Magazine story, where the mouse
10	skin studies are discussed. That's a good
11	way to introduce the public coverage of the
12	smoking and health debate, it's not the
13	first story, but it's a good one, for
14	illustrative purposes.
15	There's a series of Newsweek and
16	Time Magazine stories that cover the debate
17	in the 1950s onward from that that are good.
18	I like the Life Magazine story about -- I
19	think it's 1954. It's the one with the
20	cartoons, the guy in the coffin.
21	Q. The coffin nail?
22	A. The coffin nail one.
23	Q. The picture of the guy smoking and
24	the coffin half closed?
25	A. Yes. They try to cut off his arm.
1	I like that one. I'll probably show that.
2	I mean, I -- that would be one I might
3	consider showing.
4	There's some good coverage in U.S.
5	News & World Report, Newsweek and Time --
6	(Off the record.)
7	MS. LAWSON:
8	Q. We were interrupted. I think the
9	last thing you had said was, U.S. News &
10	World Report that you intended to use for
11	Koballa.
12	A. Yes. There's some good coverage in
13	U.S. News, Time and Newsweek from that
14	period, and those are national publications.
15	You know, they're just representative of
16	national coverage.
17	Q. And by "that period," you mean the
18	'50s?
19	A. More specifically 1954 through
20	really 1959. That's a really good set,
21	period, that would be relevant for this
22	case, given the generational position or the
23	cohort position that Ms. Koballa is in,
24	being born in the early '30s.
25	Q. Do you know when Ms. Koballa began
1	smoking?
2	A. She was about 15 or 16 when she
3	began smoking, so that would be, you know,
4	in the late '50s.
5	Q. Okay.
6	A. I'm sorry. Late '40s. I dropped a
7	decade there.
8	Q. Do you know any magazines that Ms.
9	Koballa read?
10	A. There may have been a discussion in
11	the deposition, but I'm not recalling the
12	specific magazines.
13	Q. Is it relevant to any of your
14	opinions, whether she read any specific
15	magazines?
16	A. No. it really isn't. National
17	coverage, you know, helps shape
18	understanding. Even if someone didn't read
19	a story in the paper or in a particular
20	magazine, you know, it's talked about, it's
21	just examples of information out there. Not
22	being able to point to her as an individual,
23	I won't make that direct linkage.
24	Q. Following up on your last response,
25	is that because word of mouth travels? News
1	articles are printed in one source and then
2	people talk about them?
3	A. People talk about them. At least at
4	this time, the printed press really shapes
5	television news coverage, it's just out
6	there.
7	Q. Okay. Is there any news television
8	sources that you are planning on using for
9	the Koballa case?
10	A. wel1, yes.
11	Q. Tell me about those, if you would.
12	A. Well, they're of two types. One is
13	for which I have discovered actual video,
14	surviving video. That would be the See it
15	Now programs. Those are good. I've used
16	those in the past. The other would be --
17	the other category of information would be
18	transcripts of broadcasts, news programs,
19	both on the radio and the television.
20	Q. And all the transcripts you have,
21	are they included in your reliance materials
22	that I think you told me were current up
23	through Barbanell?
24	A. They were. And for ease of
25	discovery, they're under a folder called TI,
1	something like that, Tobacco institute,
2	towards the end of my -- if you have the
3	electronic version.
4	Q. Do you know any of the particular
5	television shows that Mrs. Koballa watched?
6	A. No. I'm not familiar with her
7	television viewing habits. You know, I may
8	show television commercials, which you had
9	asked me about news earlier.
10	Q. Right. Yeah. And we'll get to the
11	commercials. Do you know if Ms. Koballa
12	watched the evening news?
13	A. I don't know if she watched it or
14	not.
15	Q. Are you planning to use any
16	television news clips other than the See it
17	Now you told me about?
18	A. Well, I may. You know, I mean, I've
19	gotten ones that I've used this spring that
20	I like, so I may draw upon those.
21	Q. And can you explain for me what
22	those are?
23	A. Yes. I've used, at various times,
24	in trials this spring, I've used, in
25	addition to See It Now, clips covering the
1	1964 Surgeon General's Report release, both
2	on NBC and CBS versions. There's a
3	transcript in my files -- I don't have the
4	video -- of a CBS program from 1962 on
5	smoking. I never used that, but I might.
6	Q. What's the name of the program; do
7	you remember?
8	A. I am not recalling, but if you
9	looked -- if I had my file structure here in
10	front of me, I could identify it for you, so
11	I'm going to write that down.
12	Q. Write that down, if you would.
13	A. For the record, I'm turning over the
14	sheet of paper. Being left-handed, my hand
15	is over the printed text, so I'm just making
16	a note about the CBS program. And I would
17	like to do that today, before you leave.
18	Q. Okay. I'm happy to let you do that
19	today before I leave.
20	A. Because sometimes there's no
21	followup, and if I say I'm going to do it, I
22	want to do it.
23	Q. Okay.
24	A. I'm turning it back over.
25	Here's one thing I've been trying to
1	find in my files and I don't -- I can't
2	remember if I lost this or not. I did some
3	research at the Vanderbilt Television News
4	Archive back around 2003, and walked away
5	with a VHS tape of clips, 1968 onward, and I
6	cannot find that tape. I've been looking
7	for it. Probably what happened, it was in
8	the materials that got inundated in the
9	great deluge.
10	But I have the record of the order
11	form, and so I may reorder that, and if I do
12	so, I'll shoot that your way.
13	Q. Okay. Are those clips right now
14	contained in your reliance materials that
15	would be current through Barbanell?
16	A. They're not because I've not been
17	able to find this tape. But I can describe
18	them for you. They are clips from the
19	television evening news from 1968 through
20	the early 1980s.
21	Q. Okay. And you said you had an order
22	form. Does that detail which particular
23	clips were on the VHS?
24	A. Right. Which means I can replace
25	the order. Let me rephrase that. I could
1	resubmit the order. I did research there.
2	I selected the ones I wanted. There was a
3	fee, nominal. It wasn't much. And they
4	sent me the VHS. It would have been 2003.
5	And, you know, I don't know where they are.
6	Q. And do you still have that order
7	form?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Okay. Can you provide us with a
10	copy of that?
11	A. I can provide that today.
12	Q. That would be excellent. Thank you.
13	A. So the vandi News, it's the kind of
14	thing where you ordered it on line, so my
15	account information is still there.
16	Q. Okay. Thank you.
17	A. I have more answers to your
18	question, though, in terms of television
19	news. There's some good stuff from the
20	1980s, 20/20.
21	Q. Such as?
22	A. 20/20. And Anne Browder interviews.
23	I've used an Anne Browder interview from
24	Miami television, an interview from 1982.
25	There's also a nice Nightline
1	interview, with the head of RJR, in the late
2	'80s. it would have been nineteen-eighty --
3	I believe '88, on the Ted Koppel news
4	program. Those are good. I don't know for
5	sure that I would use that, but that's --
6	that might be something I would recommend
7	when I talk to the attorneys, those kinds of
8	materials, particularly because of the power
9	of the visual.
10	Q. All of these materials, you can't
11	say that Ms. Koballa ever saw?
12	A. That's correct. And would not --
13	and have not done that with any plaintiff.
14	Q. All right. Now, you mentioned
15	television ads a few moments ago that you
16	might use for the Koballa case. Why don't
17	you tell me about those for the particular
18	television ads that you think you would want
19	to use for her.
20	A. Well, I've got some -- and these are
21	in my -- the video are in my reliance. The
22	really good Lucky Strike ones, which would
23	be, for example, your Lucky Strike Hit
24	Parade from the late '40s. I've got a great
25	one with the very young Frank Sinatra,
1	always a favorite. Frank Gifford, from the
2	end of the '50s.
3	You know, maybe some of the Philip
4	Morris ads from that time period, for
5	Marlboro and Philip Morris cigarettes, just,
6	you know, to illustrate the kinds of
7	materials that were available, the way
8	advertising operated on television at the
9	time. May do the Flinstones, always a
10	popular one, you know, ads like that, and
11	those are contained in my sub-folder called
12	Media.
13	Q. Okay. And as with the news clips we
14	were talking about before, you can't say
15	that Ms. Koballa saw any of these television
16	advertisements?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa ever
19	smoked Philip Morris cigarettes?
20	A. Well, I guess Basic is a Philip
21	Morris brand, I believe.
22	Q. But the brand Philip Morris, do you
23	know if she ever smoked the brand Philip
24	Morris?
25	A. Oh, no. I don't know that she did.
1	She didn't report that in her deposition.
2	But it was still a very popular program and
3	a leading brand. And, again, cigarette
4	advertising does shape expectations about
5	the cigarette, in addition to advertising
6	the particular brand.
7	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa ever
8	smoked Marlboro brand cigarettes?
9	A. I haven't seen any evidence of that.
10	Q. Okay. Do you know if Ms. Koballa
11	ever smoked Winston brand cigarettes?
12	A. The same answer. I haven't seen
13	evidence for that.
14	Q. Now, you had mentioned to me earlier
15	some magazines that you had looked at. Have
16	you ever done a systematic review of the
17	magazine Consumer Reports?
18	A. Yes. I've looked at all the
19	smoking-related Consumer Report stories.
20	Q. And all those are included within
21	your reliance materials that are current
22	through Barbanell?
23	A. Do I have copies of them all in
24	there? I don't know if they're all in
25	there. I mean, there's the filter reports.
1	I can't remember if there are any -- if
2	there are actual copies in there, but I've
3	read those.
4	Q. Can I ask you to check and see if
5	your Consumer Reports materials are within
6	your reliance materials that you've already
7	produced to us?
8	A. Sure.
9	Q. And if they're not, could I ask you
10	to produce them to us?
11	A. Sure.
12	Q. Have you ever done a systematic
13	review of the magazine Ladies Home Journal?
14	A. I've looked at selected periods of
15	that. I have not copied the articles. So
16	systematic for, really, the late '40s and
17	early '50s, only.
18	Q. And so that's not included with your
19	reliance materials which you've looked at
20	from Ladies Home Journal?
21	A. No. I haven't included any copies
22	of those.
23	Q. And you didn't keep copies of them?
24	A. I didn't make them.
25	Q. Okay. Why didn't you make copies?
1	A. Well, you know, you -- you try to
2	get an idea of the kind of information
3	that's out there. You know, making copies
4	takes a long time and, you know, if I didn't
5	think I needed the copy, I didn't make it.
6	It's expensive. You know, it's -- you don't
7	have to copy everything. I mean, as it is,
8	the amount of material is a lot. I think
9	that's a -- it's voluminous. And, you know,
10	you reach a point to diminishing returns,
11	really.
12	Q. Do you remember what sort of things
13	you looked at in Ladies Home Journal?
14	A. I looked at it mostly for the
15	advertisement.
16	Q. Anything beyond advertising?
17	A. That's it.
18	Q. Okay. Have you reviewed a magazine
19	called Family Circle?
20	A. No.
21	Q. You have reviewed Look Magazine; is
22	that right?
23	A. That's right.
24	Q. And all of your Look Magazine
25	materials, are they included within your
1	reliance documents that are current through
2	Barbanell?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And you've looked at Life Magazine?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. And all of your Life Magazine
7	materials are included in your reliance
8	documents that are current through
9	Barbanell?
10	A. Yes. I believe so, yes.
11	Q. The same question for Time Magazine.
12	A. I hired a research assistant this
13	summer to go back and copy some of the
14	articles that I lost. I had my original
15	bibliographies. And when I supplied my
16	reliance documents back in the preservation
17	deposition, I included the documents but
18	then I included a supplemental bibliography.
19	And so I made actually just -- because I
20	didn't no longer have the paper copies that
21	I had done earlier and had him get those for
22	me. And those are sitting on my desk, some
23	at home on my desk, some here on my desk.
24	But the citations for all of those
25	are in that original supplemental
1	bibliography. So if you would like the
2	copies, I'll supply you the copies.
3	Q. Would you mind?
4	A. No. I wouldn't mind. That would
5	take me -- some of them now, because I've
6	been scanning them, and then there's one set
Page 69
7	I haven't scanned, which is at home. And
8	I'll -- I know this sounds kind of crazy but
9	it's just me. I don't have a staff. And so
10	I will get you that.
11	Q. Okay. Well, thank you. I
12	appreciate that. And have you done a
13	systematic review of the magazine Newsweek?
14	A. Yes. Newsweek would be in that same
15	category where I just mentioned.
16	Q. So it would be the same as Life and
17	Look?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And then all be in your reliance
20	materials?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And the same question for Reader's
23	Digest.
24	A. Yes. My Reader's -- the Reader's
25	Digest that I rely upon are already in my
1	collection.
2	Q. Okay. Do you know if Mrs. Koballa
3	was someone who kept up with current events?
4	A. I wouldn't know either way. I'm not
5	sure even what that would mean so, no, I
6	don't know that.
7	Q. Does it have any relevance to your
8	opinions, whether she did?
9	A. Not really, no.
10	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa read the
11	newspaper daily?
12	A. I don't know whether she did or not.
13	Q. Does it have any relevance to your
14	opinions, whether she did?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa ever saw
17	any articles about smoking and health?
18	A. It wouldn't matter to me either way.
19	Q. Okay. You mentioned a little bit
20	earlier the See It Now program. Do you know
21	if Ms. Koballa ever saw that?
22	A. I don't know whether she saw it or
23	not.
24	Q. Does it have any relevance to your
25	opinions, whether she saw it?
1	A. No, it doesn't.
2	Q. Do you know anything about Ms.
3	Koballa's employment history?
4	A. A little bit. She -- I mean, she
5	describes a variety of jobs that she had,
6	both in Pennsylvania, McCrory's. I think
7	she had the lawn service job. I might be
8	getting her confused with the other case I'm
9	being asked about today. But she had a
10	variety of jobs which I would characterize
11	as kind of regular, everyday kinds of work.
12	Q. Do you know what sort of work she
Page 71
13	generally did?
14	A. She seemed to have a -- my
15	recollection is a wide variety of
16	essentially wage laborer jobs of no
17	particular profession.
18	Q. Do you know anything about where Ms.
19	Koballa went to school?
20	A. Well, she went to the schools -- the
21	public schools in her community, Brownsville
22	and those towns. She moved around a little
23	bit within that general area. I don't
24	remember all the little places that she
25	lived. She seemed to have moved a few
1	times.
2	Q. Do you know how far she went in
3	school?
4	A. She went through high school and
5	then she mentioned some kind of post high
6	school training.
7	Q. Do you know what sort of post high
8	school training she received?
9	A. I'm not recalling, nor is it on my
10	note.
11	Q. Okay. You are free to refer to your
12	note, if you would like to.
13	A. Okay. Thank you.
14	VIDEO REPORTER:
15	We need to go off record and change
Page 72
16	tapes.
17	(Off the record.)
18	VIDEO REPORTER:
19	This is the beginning of Tape Number
20	2, the deposition of Lewis Kyriakoudes, and
21	the time is 11:37.
22	MS. LAWSON:
23	Q. Do you know what textbooks were used
24	in the schools that Mrs. Koballa attended?
25	A. No. I haven't researched her
1	particular textbooks.
2	Q. Okay. Do you know if teaching on
3	health was required in Pennsylvania when
4	Mrs. Koballa was attending school?
5	A. I don't -- I don't know either way.
6	Q. Okay. Let me be more specific. Do
7	you know if teaching on the subject of
8	smoking and health was required in schools
9	in Pennsylvania when Mrs. Koballa was in
10	school?
11	A. I don't know.
12	Q. Have you reviewed any educational
13	materials from Pennsylvania?
14	A. Not unique to Pennsylvania, no.
15	Q. Are there any educational materials
16	that you would be intending to use in the
17	Koballa case?
18	A. Well, I've used in the past
Page 73
19	selections from the ama, neh Joint Committee
20	on Health Education Standards from late
21	'40s. I've used that in the past. I used
22	that in -- I believe in the Hess case, as an
23	example of the state-of-the-art on health
24	education, so to speak, best standards, best
25	practices.
1	Q. Anything else you might use in the
2	Koballa case related to education?
3	A. That's what comes to mind now.
4	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa ever
5	received any warnings about smoking and
6	health from her family members?
7	A. I don't know either way.
8	Q. Do you know if any of Ms. Koballa's
9	family members had medical training?
10	A. I don't know.
11	Q. Is it relevant to any of your
12	opinions in this case if any of Ms.
13	Koballa's family members warned her about
14	health risks of smoking?
15	A. No, it isn't.
16	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa was ever
17	warned about health risks of smoking by her
18	physicians?
19	A. I don't know.
20	Q. Is it relevant to any of your
21	opinions in this case if she was?
Page 74
22	A. No.
23	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa ever
24	heard or read the 1964 Surgeon General's
25	Report on smoking and health?
1	A. I don't know either way.
2	Q. Okay. Is it relevant to any of your
3	opinions in this case if she did?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa was aware
6	of warning labels on cigarette packages?
7	A. I don't know if she was personally
8	aware of them or not, no.
9	Q. Is it relevant to any of your
10	opinions in this case if she was?
11	A. It's not relevant.
12	Q. Do you know what injuries Mrs.
13	Koballa is claiming in this case?
14	A. I did read that, but I'm drawing a
15	blank. The general description of her
16	illness, I'd have to go back and refresh my
17	memory on that. I'm not going to testify
18	about her as an individual, so I don't
19	recall that.
20	Q. Okay, is it fair to say that it
21	doesn't really matter for your opinions in
22	this case what particular disease she's
23	alleging?
24	A. No. It doesn't matter.
Page 75
25	Q. Okay. Do you know if Ms. Koballa
1	ever had any medical training?
2	A. You know, she had some kind of post
3	high school education. I can't remember if
4	that was nurse oriented or not, so I'm not
5	recalling either way at this point.
6	Q. Do you know why Ms. Koballa tried
7	smoking cigarettes?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Is it important to your opinions in
10	this case why she did?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa smoked
13	filtered or unfiltered cigarettes?
14	A. Well, Lucky Strike is unfiltered.
15	Tarrington and Belair and Basic are
16	filtered, so she smoked both.
17	Q. Do you have any opinions regarding
18	why she smoked both filtered and unfiltered
19	cigarettes?
20	A. Not for her, as an individual.
21	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa ever
22	heard any statement from The Tobacco
23	Institute?
24	A. I don't know either way.
25	Q. Okay. Is it relevant to any of your
1	opinions in this case if she did?
2	A. No, it's not.
3	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa ever
4	heard of any statements from the Tobacco
5	Industry Research Committee?
6	A. Again, the same answer. I don't
7	know either way.
8	Q. is it fair to say it's not relevant
9	to your opinions whether she did or didn't?
10	A. Not relevant.
11	Q. Do you know if Ms. Koballa ever saw
12	The Frank Statement?
13	A. I don't know either way.
14	Q. Is it relevant to any of your
15	opinions in this case whether she saw The
16	Frank Statement?
17	A. It's not relevant.
18	Q. Do you know of any particular
19	cigarette advertisements that Ms. Koballa
20	may have seen?
21	A. No. I can't connect her to any
22	particular advertisement.
23	Q. I am probably going to start on
24	Lewis next. You want to stop here so you
25	can go to your class?
1	A. Yes. My class is 12:00 to 12:50.
2	We'll run the whole course and then usually
3	talk. But I'll be back here about maybe
4	five to ten minutes after noon, after 12:00.
5	MR. OGLE:
6	After 1:00.
7	MS. LAWSON:
8	Q. After 1:00.
9	A. I'm sorry, after 1:00. After 1:00.
10	MS. LAWSON:
11	Why don't we go off the record.
12	VIDEO REPORTER:
13	We're going off the record. The
14	time is approximately 11:43.
15	(Off the record.)
16	MS. LAWSON:
17	Q. Hope you had a good lunch. Or you
18	weren't eating. You were teaching class.
19	A. Teaching class. But I can stand to
20	miss a meal or two. I'm not going to
21	whither away.
22	Q. Before we went back on the record,
23	we were talking about, for the court
24	reporter's sake, a web site which you had
25	cited called Not a Cough in a Carload. Do
1	you remember that?
2	A. Right.
3	Q. And you described it as an on-line
4	museum; is that right?
5	A. That's right.
6	Q. Do you have what the web site
7	address for that address is?
8	A. I don't have the URL memorized.
9	It's bookmarked in my browser, but I'd
10	happily supply it to the court reporter and
11	she could insert it at this point in the
12	conversation --
13	Q. That sounds great.
14	A. -- for the use of the reader.
15	Q. Do you know who compiled that
16	on-line museum?
17	A. A medical doctor named Robert
18	Jackler, at the medical school at Stanford
19	University. A couple of other people were
20	involved, as well.
21	Q. Do you know the methodology that he
22	used in compiling it?
23	A. My understanding was it was a
24	personal collection, so the methodology
25	would be one of the -- you know, the
1	connoisseurship, if you will, almost like an
2	art collector. And I don't use the on-line
3	museum as -- itself as a representative
4	sample of all advertising, but rather as a
5	place to go to. Since I have reviewed a
6	terrific amount of advertising, that is a
7	site of higher quality scans because the
8	representations of the ads that I have vary
9	from poor to pretty good.
10	Q. Okay. Do you know where he got the
11	specific -- I assume it's all electronic.
12	Do you know where he got his electronic
13	files?
14	A. Well, he has collected the
15	originals, and then at some point, they
16	scanned -- they scan them in, you know,
17	using some scanning technology that is not
18	known to me.
19	Q. Okay. Do you know where he got the
20	originals?
21	A. My understanding is that he has just
22	been a long-time collector of cigarette
23	advertisements.
24	Q. And you are not aware of any
25	methodology he used in collecting those
1	particular advertisements?
2	A. Right. Aside from what I suggested,
3	connoisseurship, the idea of an art
4	collector, just perhaps things that appealed
5	to him. I don't know.
6	Q. Do you know where any of the
7	advertisements that he collected came from
8	originally?
9	A. Well, I can identify -- you know,
10	when I see one that I recognize, and
11	therefore use, I may use his scan over my
12	copy. So a lot of them come from Life
13	Magazine. Just as a practical matter,
14	particularly his copies from the '40s and
15	the '50s, they tend to be back cover of
16	Life, and other major magazines, but
17	particularly in Life.
18	Q. How do you know that?
19	A. Well, good point. More accurately,
20	for me, it would be better for me to say
21	that I have seen identical ads represented
22	on the back cover of Life Magazine and in
23	other magazines, as represented there.
24	Yeah. He does not supply, in that on-line
25	museum, the citations, if you will. That,
1	you have to supply -- I have to supply
2	myself.
3	Q. Have you ever talked with him about
4	where he came by the ads that he has?
5	A. No. There's just a -- I have never
6	met him or spoken with him, but there's --
7	on the web side, there's just a little brief
8	description. I think he says, I've
9	collected these ads.
10	Q. How did you find this web site?
11	A. Oh, it's been widely advertised, it
12	was featured at the New York Public Library.
13	it's covered at The New York Times, it's a
14	widely known and high-traffic web site. I
15	would describe it that way.
16	Q. Is that how you found it, just
17	through one of the sources you mentioned?
18	A. No. Actually, it was brought to my
19	attention by someone else that worked on it,
20	Robert Proctor, at Stanford University, when
21	it was just being released.
22	Q. So Dr. Proctor told you about it?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And what did he tell you about it?
25	A. There's this on-line museum.
1	There's this on-line museum that's been
2	sponsored by the Stanford University Medical
3	School, by a professor there.
4	Q. Okay. Have you and he had any other
5	conversations other than what you just
6	described to me about this web site?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Have you discussed any of the
9	advertisements on the web site with Dr.
10	Proctor?
11	A. No. No. I haven't discussed
12	anything about the -- he just alerted it to
13	me once.
14	Q. How long ago was that?
15	A. You know, whenever it was launched.
16	it's been out a couple of years, maybe, but
17	I can't remember the exact date. But
18	something like a couple years ago, more or
19	less.
20	Q. Okay. And is it true that you are
21	still the director here of the Center For
22	Oral History and Cultural History -- for
23	Heritage, I'm sorry.
24	A. Currently, now?
25	Q. Yes.
1	A. Yes. That's my position.
2	Q. And in that position, do you do oral
3	-- do you take oral histories?
4	A. Yes. We are a clearinghouse for
5	oral history interviews. We transcribe
6	them, we disseminate them, support scholars
7	who are using them.
8	Q. And do you, yourself, take oral
9	histories?
10	A. Yes. I conduct interviews.
11	Q. Do you have a particular methodology
12	you use for conducting interviews?
13	A. it depends. There's a couple of
14	standard approaches. You can divide them
15	into two broad categories, which would be
16	the life story approach or what I might call
17	the project-focused approach.
18	And life story approach is to sit
19	down with somebody and just say, well, tell
20	me, you know, where you grew up, and just
21	kind of take them and have them share with
22	you some aspect, as they define it, of their
23	1 i f e.
24	The project-oriented approach would
25	be you are interested in something more
1	focused. Tell me about this.
2	Q. Okay. Do you ever do any -- aside
3	from interviewing people, do you ever do
4	anything to determine the validity of what
5	people are telling you or its truthfulness?
6	A. Well, that's an issue with oral
7	histories. People's memory is fallible.
8	People don't always tell the truth. The way
9	--if you want to confirm a particular fact
10	or event in an interview, you know, you go
11	for independent verification.
12	As a rule -- it varies in different
13	research fields, but as a rule, in oral
14	history, people's memories of their emotions
15	and their feelings and their self
16	perceptions of themselves, when they're
17	being candid, have a high degree of validity
18	because emotional memory tends to be very
19	strong.
20	Event memory seems to be highly
21	fallible. But there are techniques to both
22	assist the interviewer -- I'm sorry, the
23	interviewee and techniques for evaluation.
24	Q. What techniques do you use for
25	evaluation?
1	A. Well, one could -- for an
2	evaluation, you go look it up, you know. If
3	a guy says, you know, I was here, you know,
4	and this happened, you go to try to find
5	that -- maybe some independent verification
6	that that thing actually happened in some
7	documentary evidence.
8	I mean, oral history is -- oral
9	history often fills the gaps left by the
10	documentary record, particularly in people's
11	feelings and ideas and impressions. But it
12	is highly fallible, in terms of events,
13	particularly when you are dealing with an
14	older person and there's a long distance of
15	time.
16	Yet, you know, sometimes, people can
17	remember, you know, when they were 18, even
18	though they're 80. We see this with
19	servicemen, veterans, and those experiences
20	are so deeply impressed upon their minds
21	that, you know, they remember those well.
22	So it's -- every situation can be different.
23	Q. Okay. I was going over your CV, and
24	in looking at some of the lectures, I notice
25	one of the lectures, it looks like the most
1	recent invited lecture you have listed is
2	called, "what Does the Cigarette Epidemic in
3	the American South Tell Us About Global
4	Tobacco Control Today?" Do you remember
5	delivering that?
6	A. is that the one at the Peking
7	University --
8	Q. It's this one right there.
9	A. The Hutchins. Yes. I gave -- if
10	you notice, they're separated by, like, a
11	couple of days.
12	Q. Right, it's the same talk?
13	A. No. it's different.
14	Q. Different talks?
15	A. Yeah. They were a little bit
16	different. Some overlapped, you know, some
17	similar slides. But this one was given to
18	an Asian studies, Peking university/UNC
19	Joint Health Project, so I had some stuff on
20	there. But, yeah, I supplied that to you a
21	long time ago.
22	Q. Who invited you to do this
23	particular -- the first one, let's start
24	with the first one, who invited you to do
25	that lecture?
1	A. That one, that was invited by a guy
2	named Harry Watson, who is director of that
3	Center For the Study of the American South.
4	Q. is he a professor at Chapel Hill?
5	A. He's a historian, yes.
6	Q. is he the same one who invited you
7	to do the second one?
8	A. No. Actually, the second one -- and
9	I just noticed it. The one that we say
10	second actually occurred --
11	Q. Afterwards?
12	A. Before, the 31st. This one happened
13	on the --
14	Q. On the 5th?
15	A. On the 5th of February. Just for
16	the record, January 31st is the one in
17	quotes.
18	Q. That's the one for the Peking
19	University?
20	A. Yes. That was a medical doctor
21	named Adam Goldstein invited me to that. He
22	was one of the organizers of that
23	conference.
24	Q. Is he a professor somewhere or is he
25	just a medical doctor?
1	A. He is a professor of family medicine
2	and he heads up something called the -- I
3	believe it's called the Tobacco Control
Page 87
4	Evaluation Project, or something like that,
5	at UNC Chapel Hill Medical School.
6	Q. Do you know why you were invited to
7	do that?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Why?
10	A. He had heard about my work, and he
11	was particularly interested in somebody who
12	could speak to the history of tobacco use in
13	the south and who could also make
14	connections between what was happening in
15	Asia, generally, and China specifically, and
16	in the American south, because UNC, while a
17	global university, is still very much rooted
18	in its region.
19	And I shared the stage with an
20	eminent health economist named Tei Wei Hu,
21	T-e-i w-e-i H-u, three words, and he spoke
22	about tobacco control in China and an
23	ongoing research project that they had and I
24	talked about my research.
25	Q. Have you done any research on
1	smoking and health outside the United
2	States?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And what have you done?
5	A. I've -- mostly through reading
6	what's called secondary literature studies.
Page 88
7	I've been very interested in Asian smoking
8	patterns, mostly looking at prevalence.
9	There's a large literature on the
10	anthropology of smoking in China because
11	gift giving is an important element in
12	Chinese smoking.
13	Another interesting aspect of
14	Chinese smoking is there's a strong gender
15	imbalance, very high rates of prevalence
16	among men, but very low rates of prevalence
17	among women, something like four percent.
18	So that's always kind of an interesting
19	phenomena. But I don't speak Chinese, have
20	never been to China, so mostly through
21	reading other people's research.
22	Q. So that would severely limit your
23	ability to do research on Chinese health
24	attitudes or attitudes towards smoking and
25	health?
1	A. Not having been to China?
2	Q. Not having been to China and not
3	speaking Chinese.
4	A. Well, not having been to China would
5	limit it. Not speaking Chinese is less of a
6	handicap because, you know, you can employ
7	translators and assistance like that. But
8	that's what I've done on that.
9	Q. I want to ask you some questions now
Page 89
10	about the Lewis case. Do you know what the
11	name of the smoker in the Lewis case was?
12	A. Let me refer to my notes. I thought
13	it was Rosemary Lewis, although it's not
14	indicated on my notes her first name.
15	Q. You believe it was Rosemary?
16	A. Yes, Rosemary Lewis.
17	Q. And do you know if Ms. Lewis is
18	still with us or if she's died?
19	A. Well, I read her deposition, so
20	obviously, she was alive at the time of the
21	deposition, which was given about a year
22	ago, but I don't know if she's alive right
23	now.
24	Q. What do you know about Mrs. Lewis?
25	A. She grew up in the New York area,
1	out in Long Island. She began smoking when
2	she was in high school. She was born right
3	after world war II. She held a variety of
4	jobs, worked in an electrical assembly,
5	electrical parts assembly factory out in
6	Long island, and drugstore clerk. She had a
7	baby right -- well, I guess she says she
8	dropped out of high school, I guess, to have
9	her baby towards the end, there. Lived in
10	the New York area, lived in Florida. She
11	and her husband had a -- I guess you would
12	call a landscaping business.
Page 90
13	Q. Do you remember the year she was
14	born?
15	A. '46 is my recollection.
16	Q. The particular year she was born, is
17	that relevant to your opinions regarding her
18	case in any way?
19	A. Only to the extent that it's -- and
20	this is true of any case I've been involved
21	with, and I've said this before, locating
22	the smoker, who may or may not be the
23	plaintiff, in historical time and place.
24	And so, you know, being born in her age
25	cohort is important. That's a significant
1	thing to know.
2	Q. And that would be a different age
3	cohort than Ms. Koballa, wouldn't it?
4	A. Right, who was born in 1933, 13
5	years earlier.
6	Q. Now, you mentioned Ms. Lewis living
7	in, I think it was Long Island, New York,
8	and I think you mentioned her living in
9	Florida. Do you know the time periods since
10	she lived in New York?
11	A. Well, she seemed to have spent most
12	of her time, her youth, her upbringing in
13	New York, it looks like they moved to
14	Florida, then moved back, and then moved
15	back to Florida in the '90s. That's -- it
Page 91
16	was a little unclear from the deposition. I
17	did not have interrogatories which would
18	have listed that residential history. That
19	would have been an aid, but I don't have
20	those.
21	Q. I don't think I asked you this, but
22	did you have interrogatory responses in the
23	Koballa case?
24	A. I did. Those were sent to me and I
25	reviewed that.
1	Q. Have you asked for interrogatory
2	responses in the Lewis case?
3	A. Actually, I did, and was given, on
4	Friday, the materials for Lewis. So when I
5	began reviewing them this weekend, it was
6	actually Saturday afternoon, the law office
7	was closed, so I wasn't able to request
8	that.
9	But, you know, that would list --
10	usually, there's a standard question, where
11	have you lived and that would be -- I would
12	have to piece it together from a deposition,
13	which is really more concerned about her
14	health ailments than anything else.
15	Q. Do you know where in Florida Ms.
16	Lewis lived?
17	A. She lived in a number of places. I
18	guess they would all be kind of in the
Page 92
19	general Daytona Beach area, but I don't know
20	exactly where all of the places were located
21	on the map. Some of them were small
22	communities that weren't familiar to me.
23	Q. Other than Florida and New York, do
24	you know if Mrs. Lewis lived in any other
25	state?
1	A. I think that's -- you know, she
2	mentions living, you know, kind of on the
3	other end of New York City for a while, over
4	towards the New Jersey side, but that's all
5	I can gather, from what I read.
6	Q. Okay. Have you looked at any of the
7	local newspapers from Long Island, New York?
8	A. At an earlier period in time, I had
9	reviewed Newsweek for the 1960s, but I've
10	not looked at, say, for example, The Long
11	island Press, which is a small newspaper.
12	You know, Long Island mostly relies on, you
13	know, the New York City papers.
14	Q. Do you have any intention of going
15	and looking at Long Island, New York papers
16	for the Lewis case?
17	A. No, I don't.
18	Q. So you are not going to get on
19	Newspaperarchives.org and look at little
20	Long Island newspapers?
21	A. No. My New York City area research
Page 93
22	is sufficient for my opinions.
23	Q. Have you looked at any newspapers
24	from any of the areas in Florida where Mrs.
25	Lewis lived?
1	A. No, I haven't.
2	Q. Do you have any intention of doing
3	so?
4	A. NO.
5	Q. Any other newspaper research that
6	you plan on doing for the Lewis case that
7	you haven't done so far?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Any research on magazines that you
10	intend to do for the Lewis case that you
11	haven't done so far?
12	A. No. in the earlier period of this
13	deposition, I had mentioned that I had some
14	stuff on disk that I was going to give you,
15	but nothing beyond that.
16	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis ever read
17	The New York Times?
18	A. I don't know either way. I don't
19	know.
20	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions in
21	this case if she did?
22	A. No.
23	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis ever read
24	any newspapers in Florida?
Page 94
25	A. I don't know.
1	Q. Is it relevant to any of your
2	opinions in this case if she did?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis ever read
5	any magazines?
6	A. I don't.
7	Q. Is it relevant to any of your
8	opinions in this case if she did?
9	A. No.
10	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis was
11	someone who kept up with current events,
12	things that were going on?
13	A. I don't know that.
14	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions in
15	this case?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Do you know of any television shows
18	that Mrs. Lewis watched?
19	A. I don't.
20	Q. Is that relevant to any of your
21	opinions in this case, if she watched
22	television?
23	A. No.
24	Q. Do you know where Mrs. Lewis went to
25	school?
1	A. it was out on the island. I forget
2	which community it was right now, but out on
3	Long Island.
4	Q. Okay, would that be true all the
5	way through high school?
6	A. Did she go to high school in
7	Meadville? I'm not sure. I would have to
8	-- where is Meadville? I'm not sure where
9	that is. It might be not on Long Island. I
10	would have to check that.
11	Q. Do you know if she finished high
12	school?
13	A. Well, she reports that she left high
14	school. I guess she says she was pregnant
15	and had a baby.
16	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions in
17	this case if she finished high school?
18	A. No.
19	Q. Have you done any research on
20	whether smoking and health was being taught
21	in schools in New York when Mrs. Lewis was
22	attending?
23	A. I have some materials, textbook
24	materials I have looked at, so I've looked
25	at it a little bit, yes.
1	Q. And what have you looked at?
2	A. I've got some textbooks in my
3	reliance documents, which I believe were
4	employed in New York, could be employed in
5	New York. Whether they actually were, I
6	don't know.
7	Q. Have you done any specific research
8	on which textbooks were used in New York
9	public schools?
10	A. No. No. And not -- and to be more
11	pointed, not which books may have been used
12	by Ms. Lewi s.
13	Q. So you don't know which textbooks
14	were specifically used in New York and you
15	don't know which textbooks were specifically
16	used in schools where Mrs. Lewis attended?
17	A. That's right.
18	Q. Do you know if there were any rules
19	against smoking in the schools that Mrs.
20	Lewis attended?
21	A. Well, it's hard to say. You know,
22	she says that they used to go in the woods
23	and smoke. You know, that's about the time
24	that many schools in the New York
25	metropolitan area were also implementing
1	smoking lounges for students.
2	Her specific school, I can't say.
3	But, as a general proposition, you did have
4	these kind of countervailing trends.
5	Q. Have you done any research on
6	educational materials used in New York to
7	teach students on health effects of smoking
8	during the time Mrs. Lewis was in school?
9	A. No.
10	Q. Is it -- would any of that be
11	relevant to your opinions in this case?
12	A. I mean, I've reviewed so many health
13	textbooks from that period, that would
14	simply be kind of cumulative. I would be
15	diminishing returns.
16	Q. Is that a no?
17	A. That would be no, yes. It wouldn't
18	be relevant.
19	Q. Do you know if any of Mrs. Lewis's
20	family members ever warned her about any
21	health effects of smoking?
22	A. I can't recall either way.
23	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions if
24	they did?
25	A. No.
1	Q. Do you know if any friends ever
2	warned Mrs. Lewis about health effects of
3	smoking?
4	A. The same answer. I don't know.
5	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions if
6	they did?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Do you know if any doctors ever
9	warned Mrs. Lewis about the health effects
10	of smoking?
11	A. I don't know.
12	Q. Would it be relevant to your
13	opinions if they did?
14	A. No.
15	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis ever heard
16	of the 1964 Surgeon General's Report?
17	A. I don't know what she heard.
18	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions
19	whether she heard of it?
20	A. No.
21	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis ever saw
22	warning labels on cigarette packages?
23	A. Well, they were on the cigarettes
24	after a period, but I don't know whether --
25	what she has reported about that.
1	Q. Okay. Is it relevant to your
2	opinions in any way if she saw the warning
3	labels?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Do you know what disease Mrs. Lewis
6	is alleging that she suffered from?
7	A. No. I haven't read the complaint
8	and I don't know what disease.
9	Q. is it at all relevant to your
10	opinions what disease she's alleging?
11	A. NO.
12	Q. I think you told me a while ago that
13	you believe Mrs. Lewis began smoking in high
14	school; is that right?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Did that information come from her
17	deposition?
18	A. Yes. She said she started smoking
19	in her junior year.
20	Q. Do you know when she became a
21	regular smoker? And by that, I mean she
22	smoked every day.
23	A. I mean, she discusses that, but I'm
24	not recalling when she identifies that
25	point.
1	Q. is it significant to your opinions
2	at all if there is a gap in time between
3	when she first tried cigarettes and when she
4	became a regular smoker?
5	A. No. I mean, I'm not going to -- you
6	know, I'm going to take the position I've
7	taken consistently on the plaintiff in all
8	of my testimony, and that would fit within
9	that, as well. So, no, it's not important
10	for my opinions.
11	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis was
12	already an adult when she began -- became a
13	regular smoker?
14	A. All I know is that she reports
15	starting in the deposition when she was a
16	junior in high school. You know, is adult
17	18 or 21?
18	Q. 18.
19	A. 18. So she was born in '46. I
20	mean, she probably was under 18 her junior
21	year.
22	Q. Would it be relevant to your
23	opinions if she was 18 or above when she
24	became a regular smoker?
25	A. No.
1	Q. Do you know anything about why Mrs.
2	Lewis started smoking?
3	A. The same point where -- she's asked
4	that question in the deposition and she
5	says, I don't know. So, I mean, I don't
6	have any insight into why she became a
7	smoker, her as an individual. You know,
8	groups of people, you know, smoking
9	initiation as a kind of social and
10	historical phenomenon, that, I have insight
11	into, but that's different than her, as a
12	specific individual, distinct from the rest
13	of the population.
14	Q. Do you know what brand she smoked?
15	A. She was smoking some menthol brands.
16	She was smoking Marl boros. I thought -- and
17	I'm just relying on memory, so I might be
18	wrong, but I thought she said Salem
19	initially, but I'd have to --
20	Q. Do you need to refer to your notes?
21	A. I didn't write that down on the
22	notes.
23	Q. So you believe she smoked Salem,
24	Marlboro and some menthol?
25	A. Well, Salem would be a menthol. And
1	then she mentions more menthol in there.
2	And I just -- I wanted to look that up and I
3	just didn't have the time. That was -- I'm
4	familiar with the More brand. I didn't
5	realize they had a menthol.
6	Q. Do you know if she smoked filtered
7	or unfiltered cigarettes?
8	A. Well, Salem and Marlboro would be
9	filtered so, yes, she did smoke filtered
10	cigarettes.
11	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions in
12	any way whether particular individuals
13	smoked filtered cigarettes versus
14	unfiltered?
15	A. Well, you know, the shift from
16	unfiltered to filtered is an important part
17	of the history of the cigarette and is
18	relevant to the issue of public knowledge
19	and public awareness on the risks of
20	smoking.
21	But I will qualify that by saying
22	that by the time that Ms. Lewis is becoming
23	a smoker, the market is heavily dominated by
24	filters. So, generally, my testimony has
25	been in the 1950s, people were switching to
1	filters because they thought that they were
2	getting a health benefit.
3	People continued to think that in
4	the 1960s, as a general proposition.
5	Filters have become kind of a standard
6	fixture on cigarettes, so a lot of the
7	competition was between different filters as
8	opposed to filter and unfiltered. So
9	there's a difference, there, in the early
10	'50s compared to mid to late '60s.
11	Q. Are you familiar with the term
12	called "the tar derbies"?
13	A. Yes, from the 1950s.
14	Q. And was that basically a competition
15	among cigarette companies discussing whose
16	filters were the most effective?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And that would be the most effective
19	at filtering out tar and nicotine?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis ever heard
22	any statement from The Tobacco Institute?
23	A. I don't know her, as an individual,
24	no.
25	Q. Would it make any difference in your
1	opinions, if she did or didn't?
2	A. No.
3	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis ever heard
4	any statement from the Tobacco Industry
5	Research Committee?
6	A. I don't know.
7	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions
8	whether she did or didn't?
9	A. No.
10	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis ever heard
11	of any statement from the Council For
12	Tobacco Research?
13	A. I don't know.
14	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions in
15	any way, whether she did or didn't?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis ever saw
18	The Frank Statement?
19	A. I don't know if she saw it.
20	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions in
21	any way whether she saw it?
22	A. It's not.
23	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Lewis ever saw
24	any statement from any tobacco company?
25	A. I don't know if she saw any
1	particular statement, no.
2	Q. Is it relevant to your opinions in
3	any way, whether she saw a statement from a
4	tobacco company?
5	A. No.
6	Q. Let me ask, you've served as a
7	plaintiff's expert in numerous smoking and
8	health cases; is that correct?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. In any of the cases in which you
11	served as an expert for the plaintiffs, have
12	you ever seen a particular plaintiff that
13	heard a statement from The Tobacco
14	Institute?
15	A. Well, I just don't look at that.
16	They may have some -- some have reported
17	seeing that. Some haven't. But that
18	doesn't figure into my analysis, so it's not
19	something I kind of keep track of.
20	Q. Okay. To the best of your
21	recollection, have you ever heard of a
22	plaintiff seeing or hearing any statement
23	from The Tobacco institute?
24	A. Again, that's not something I've
25	kept track of, so I wouldn't be able to
1	answer either way.
2	Q. So you just don't know?
3	A. Right.
4	Q. The same question for the Tobacco
5	industry Research Committee, in the cases
6	in which you've served as a plaintiff's
7	expert, do you recall any plaintiff ever
8	seeing a statement from the Tobacco industry
9	Research Committee?
10	MR. OGLE:
11	Form objection. I object to the
12	form. You can still answer.
13	A. I just have no answer for that
14	either way. That's not something I've kept
15	track of. There may be testimony to that
16	effect in the cases. There may not be. I
17	just don't know. That's not something I've
18	looked into.
19	MS. LAWSON:
20	Q. So it's fair to say you don't know?
21	A. That's right. I don't know.
22	Q. Okay. In all the cases in which
23	you've served as an expert for the
24	plaintiffs in the smoking and health case,
25	have you ever seen any plaintiff that has
1	heard a statement from the Council For
2	Tobacco Research?
3	MR. OGLE:
4	Form objection.
5	A. Same answer.
6	MS. LAWSON:
7	Q. Which is I don't know?
8	A. Yes, I don't know. I haven't kept
9	up with that.
10	Q. Are you aware of any plaintiff in
11	any smoking and health suit that you've
12	served as an expert ever seeing or hearing
13	The Frank Statement?
14	MR. OGLE:
15	Form objection.
16	A. I just don't know.
17	MS. LAWSON:
18	Q. Do you know of any specific
19	advertisements that Mrs. Lewis may have
20	seen?
21	A. As far as an individual, no.
22	Q. Do you have any idea whether
23	advertising played any role in Mrs. Lewis's
24	decision to begin smoking?
25	A. I have no way of evaluating that.
1	Q. Are you familiar with a poll that
2	was published in Senior Scholastic in 1960?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. What do you remember about that
5	poll?
6	A. Well, I talk about it in my tobacco
Page 107
7	control article, it was a self-selected
8	poll, it's not fair to call it a poll, it
9	wasn't a scientifically conducted poll.
10	Q. well, let me ask you, what did
11	Senior Scholastic call it?
12	A. I've got it on my desk. And you
13	have a copy.
14	Q. I have a copy, too.
15	MS. LAWSON:
16	We can mark it, if you like. Why
17	don't we mark this.
18	(Exhibit 7 was marked.)
19	A. I mean, they don't really call it
20	anything. I think you are showing me the
21	wrong story.
22	MS. LAWSON:
23	Q. There were several stories on that
24	particular --
25	A. Right. What -- I think what -- I
1	mean, there's another one where they
2	actually discuss the poll. This is the one
3	where they just discuss the smoking and
4	health controversy. There's one from about
5	the same time that actually deals with the
6	results of their mail-in survey.
7	Q. That has the question and then the
8	responses they received from the question.
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Let me ask you about this one.
11	Let's refer to Page 16, which I think is the
12	last page on this.
13	A. I have that other one if you want me
14	to go and get it.
15	Q. I have it too.
16	A. Okay. I see. I see it, uh-huh.
17	Q. Okay. There's a paragraph that
18	starts out "health." Do you see that,
19	"health authorities"?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Okay, it says, "Health authorities
22	report that they are particularly concerned
23	about the findings of a survey conducted
24	last December by Scholastic Magazine's
25	Institute of Student Opinion. Of 10,763
1	students polled by ISO, 97.4 percent said
2	they believed there was a link between
3	smoking and lung cancer."
4	And then it goes onto say, "in spite
5	of this, 21 percent of the students said
6	they smoked."
7	Did I read that correctly?
8	A. You read that correctly.
9	Q. Do you know what the Institute of
10	Student Opinion is or was?
11	A. No, I don't.
12	Q. And they call it a couple of things
Page 109
13	here, or the Senior Scholastic, they call it
14	first a survey; is that correct?
15	A. They use that word.
16	Q. Okay. And then they say, of 10,763
17	students polled by the ISO. So they use the
18	word "polled" also, don't they?
19	A. Yes. They use that word. That
20	doesn't mean that this is an appropriately
21	drawn sample.
22	I agree with Mr. Tedin, who is an
23	expert in the employ of your side, who says
24	that this is not a scientifically valid
25	sample and no significant conclusions can be
1	drawn from this data, these data.
2	Q. I think you told me you didn't know
3	anything about the Institute of Student
4	Opinion; is that right?
5	A. That's right.
6	Q. So you don't know if they're
7	reliable or not reliable?
8	A. Yes. Who knows who that
9	organization is? I do know how the poll was
10	conducted.
11	Q. Tell me what you know about how the
12	poll was conducted.
13	A. it was a self-selected poll
14	discussed at length in a number of
15	publications. Students were polled in the
Page 110
16	-- or asked in the classroom. There was no
17	attempt to create a random sample or a
18	scientifically valid sample, and therefore,
19	you know, it's difficult to draw any
20	conclusive results from those findings, no
21	matter what language the writer of the
22	newspaper article here used to describe it.
23	Q. Okay. The circumstances you just
24	described of this polling or survey or
25	whatever you want to call it of students,
1	what's the source of your information about
2	how it was conducted?
3	A. The principal source is an article
4	and also deposition testimony of Lydia Saad,
5	with the Gallup organization.
6	Q. Have you ever met Ms. Saad?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Do you know anything about where
9	Mrs. Saad got her information?
10	A. it's been a long time since I read
11	those articles. I would have to refresh my
12	memory of those particular documents. I
13	mean, it's been, you know, four or five
14	years since I've looked at that.
15	Q. So is the answer to my question, you
16	don't know?
17	A. I can't recall, no.
18	Q. Do you know if Ms. Saad is a
Page 111
19	historian?
20	A. No. She's a polling person. Well,
21	at least at the time that I was -- I'm not
22	sure where she works now, but at the time,
23	she was with the Gallup organization.
24	Q. Do you know what she did there?
25	A. You know, her title is on the
1	article, but I'm not remembering right now
2	what the article -- what her title was.
3	Q. Do you know if Mrs. Saad ever wrote
4	anything, such as an article, about her
5	criticism of defense historian's use of this
6	particular Senior Scholastic poll or survey?
7	A. Well, she wrote a paper. She
8	coauthored a paper.
9	Q. Do you know what became of the
10	paper?
11	A. No. She presented it at a
12	professional forum. That's all I know.
13	Q. Okay. Do you know if she ever tried
14	to get it published in a peer-reviewed
15	journal?
16	A. I don't know that. It wouldn't
17	matter.
18	Q. Okay.
19	A. I mean, the basic point about the
20	poll is pretty straightforward.
21	Q. Would it matter to you if she had
Page 112
22	tried to get it published in a peer-reviewed
23	journal and it was rejected?
24	A. No.
25	Q. Why not?
1	A. Because that article deals with a
2	lot of -- a lot of issues, a broader issue.
3	I think, you know, on anybody familiar with
4	the elementary techniques of sampling, there
5	would be no disagreement about what she said
6	about the Senior Scholastic poll. And your
7	own polling expert holds that opinion, as
8	well. So that's not a controversial point.
9	Q. In trying to evaluate the
10	circumstances in which the poll or the
11	survey was done, wouldn't it be important to
12	know the source of the information who was
13	telling you what those circumstances were
14	and whether that source was reliable?
15	A. Well, I have multiple sources on
16	that, so --
17	Q. Well, you cited Mrs. Saad to me.
18	who else?
19	A. Mr. Tedin.
20	Q. what did Mr. Tedin, to the best of
21	your understanding, say about the
22	circumstances surrounding how this survey
23	was done?
24	A. The same thing that Ms. Saad said,
Page 113
25	which was it was a self-selected sample that
1	was not, you know, scientifically derived to
2	be representative of anything.
3	Q. Do you know -- when you say
4	"self-selected," explain to me what you
5	mean.
6	A. Well, it's a fundamental proposition
7	of survey research, polling research and,
8	indeed, all statistical analysis, that --
9	you have two choices. You either speak --
10	you either survey the entire population.
11	The U.S. Census would be an example of that.
12	But more commonly, that's unrealistic, so
13	you choose a sample. And for the sample to
14	be representative of the larger population,
15	it has to be done on a scientific basis,
16	which generally means random sample.
17	Now, there are many techniques to do
18	that and there's lots of -- in some ways,
19	one might argue that it is as much art as
20	science to actually implement it.
21	But the basic principle is that you
22	want to have a sample in which any member of
23	the population, theoretically, could be
24	randomly included in the sample, and
25	therefore, there is no bias.
1	You know, an example of bias would
2	be, you know, surveying people on their
3	opinions about who should be elected
4	president at the Republican National
5	Convention, and then saying, see, John
6	McCain's going to win.
7	And so that's the basic principle.
8	It's elementary. This poll was not
9	conducted in that manner, and so it's
10	difficult to draw any conclusive conclusions
11	from that result.
12	I mean, you would be better off
13	using, like, the 1970 report on teenage
14	smoking by the Clearinghouse of Smoking and
15	Health, which asks many similar questions,
16	but does so in a more rigorous fashion with
17	a legitimate sample.
18	Q. Let me ask you, in this particular
19	case, students were given cards with
20	questions on them; is that right?
21	A. That's right.
22	Q. Do you know how it was determined
23	which students got the cards?
24	A. Well, see, that's part of the
25	problem. You know, you hand out the
1	magazine. You don't know -- on so many
2	levels, you just don't know where the bias
3	creeps in. You know, who gets the magazine?
4	Some classes may use it, some may not. what
5	influence does the teacher have on the card?
6	I mean, are the cards secret? Are they
7	secret ballots or not? We don't know this.
8	So there's -- on so many levels.
9	And without being glib, you know, this kind
10	of reads like the elections in the Soviet
11	Union, you know, where people would win an
12	election with 97.4 percent of the vote. You
13	know, we know those weren't free and fair
14	elections.
15	So that's the issue. This is just
16	not a good example. I mean, you can't draw
17	any real inference from the Senior
18	Scholastic polling data that was presented
19	in this article and the other articles.
20	Q. Is it your opinion that the 97.4
21	percentage figure makes it inherently
22	unreliable?
23	A. No. what makes it unreliable is the
24	fact that the conditions of the survey,
25	which you just described well, open it to
1	all sorts of bias, non-statistical1y valid
2	results.
3	Q. Do you know how many cards were
4	distributed in the sample?
5	A. Well, that's another issue, too.
6	what is the response rate? And that's an
7	important -- I don't know and that's an
8	important factor to consider when evaluating
9	a sample. Because, you know, you choose a
10	sample, you distribute, you know -- maybe
11	they distributed 100,000 or half a million
12	copies of the magazine. I don't know. But
13	if you get back only a small portion of
14	that, you are only getting a small portion
15	of the total sample there. And there may be
16	some bias involved in that. And when I use
17	"bias," I mean in the technical, statistical
18	sense.
19	Q. How widely circulated was the Senior
20	Scholastic magazine in the late 1950s, early
21	1960s?
22	A. I don't know. I don't know their
23	full circulation.
24	Q. Do you know where it circulated?
25	A. I know that it circulated across the
1	country. It was a national magazine, you
2	subscribed to it, and that subscription
3	decision often was made by the teacher, you
4	know, who would incorporate it in his or her
5	classroom activities.
6	Q. Do you know if there was any area of
7	the country to which Senior Scholastic did
8	not circulate?
9	A. No. I mean, they describe
10	themselves as a national magazine. I -- you
11	know, I mean, they may not have gotten many
12	copies in the Mississippi Delta, but I
13	haven't researched that. I don't know.
14	Q. So you just don't know?
15	A. That's right.
16	Q. Let me ask you, too, about the
17	number of cards that were involved in this
18	or the number of responses. There were more
19	than 10,000; is that right?
20	A. Well, I don't really know how many
21	there were.
22	Q. I think they said in the article.
23	They said of 10,763 students polled by ISO.
24	Is that right?
25	A. Right. But that doesn't tell you --
1	it's unclear if that figure refers to the
2	number of cards that they printed or their
3	response rate, and I think 10,763 is an
4	unusual number of cards to print up.
5	Usually, these are in round numbers and
6	blocks. So that's --
7	Q. Wouldn't it make sense, that's the
8	number of responses they received?
9	A. That's likely what the case is.
10	But, you know, you are given no indication
11	as to what the total number sent out was.
12	Q. Okay. 10,000, for any particular
13	poll, would be a very large number of
14	people, wouldn't it?
15	A. What do you mean?
16	Q. Well, the Gallup polls that you've
17	talked about from the 1950s and 1960s, do
18	they have samples as large as 10,000?
19	A. You know, you are sitting here and
20	asking me that question. That's the most
21	ridiculous thing. I know you know better
22	than that.
23	Q. I'm just asking.
24	A. You are just asking, but this is
25	ridiculous.
1	MR. HENK:
2	I'm going to object, for the record,
3	that it's totally inappropriate for a
4	witness to comment on whether they think
5	counsel's question is appropriate or not.
6	it's offensive.
7	MS. LAWSON:
8	And I agree, it's your job to
9	answer the question.
10	A. I have written about this. You know
11	what my answer is. And you know that any
12	elementary, basic textbook on statistics is
13	going to tell you, it doesn't matter how big
14	the sample is. Sample size, in actual
15	numbers, the N, makes no bearing whatsoever
16	on the statistical validity of the sample.
17	The Gallup poll can run samples of
18	between 1,000 to 2000, but as a rule -- and,
19	of course, there's some -- they've changed
20	their methodology over the years, but as a
21	rule, they strive to be statistically
22	representative, as best as humanly possible.
23	Just because you get more responses
24	doesn't mean that you have any better
25	statistical validity and predictive power.
1	And the great example is Literary
2	Digest, which sought to get as many
3	responses to who would be president in 1936,
4	and came down affirmatively, by golly, it's
5	going to be Alf Landon. And they weren't
6	right. Alf Landon by a landslide.
7	But they had basically gotten their
8	polling registrants, much like this poll, by
9	going to tax rolls and car registrations,
10	and there's a bias there because during the
11	depression, people that had cars tend to
12	have more money.
13	So that's -- it's ridiculous even to
14	raise that issue. I mean, that is -- it's
15	so elementary, and any expert that
16	represents to a jury that simply because
17	10,000 cases is ten times larger than one
18	thousand cases, even though there's -- one
19	is the -- the smaller number strives to be a
20	representative random sample and the other
21	one isn't, that the larger sample is in any
22	way more representative is engaging in
23	deception, either by comission, because they
24	know better, or simply they are so untrained
25	in elementary statistics that they just
1	don't know this. Either way, they ought not
2	to be able to -- they should not make that
3	statement in a court of law.
4	MR. HENK:
5	For the record, I'm going to object
6	to that entire answer as nonresponsive.
7	MS. LAWSON:
8	Yeah. I'm going to move to strike
9	it as nonresponsive.
10	MR. HENK:
11	Nonresponsive to the question.
12	MS. LAWSON:
13	Q. Is it your opinion that the number
14	of people involved in a poll is not
15	relevant?
16	A. Well, what's important is whether
17	you have a randomly selected, statistically
18	valid sample or not. That's the issue.
19	Now, within statistical sampling,
20	within random samples, with good samples,
21	size makes a matter -- the size of the N,
22	the size of the sample does matter.
23	The larger the random sample, the
24	more likely it's going to be representative,
25	the less prone to error, to random error,
1	statistical error, and it -- as a rule, it
2	matters when you begin manipulating the poll
3	data yourself and you begin breaking down
4	the polling data into its various
5	subcategories. And the smaller you slice
6	and dice the sample, the greater the chances
7	for statistical error.
8	But, you know, we have tools for
9	that. You know, this is what, you know --
10	this is what P values are for. And so we
11	have ways to evaluate the degree of error.
12	And when I say "error," I mean error defined
13	as the results are a product of random
14	statistical variation, as opposed to what we
15	think are significant statistical facts
16	within the particular sample.
17	So to ask that question, I can't
18	really give you an answer because it just
19	depends on -- within the world of randomly
20	scientifically derived samples, all things
21	being equal, larger is better. But there
22	are points of diminishing returns and so the
23	rule is big enough.
24	Q. Do you know how many high school
25	students there were in the United States in
1	1959 in public schools?
2	A. I could look that up, but I don't
3	have the number at my fingertips.
4	Q. Okay. And you certainly didn't have
5	it available to you when you were evaluating
6	this particular number, did you, from the
7	Senior Scholastic?
8	A. That number would not be one that --
9	that would not be a relevant number because
10	the Senior Scholastic poll was not an
11	attempt at a random sample of a high school
12	population. You would want to know that if
13	you were attempting a random statistically
14	representative sample of a high school
15	population. That's not what this poll is.
16	Q. Is it your opinion that all
17	self-selection surveys are inherently
18	unreliable?
19	A. Well, you know, as I quote in my
20	article, a nice little phrase that I learned
21	from the American Mathematical Society,
22	they're called slops, and they are slops
23	because they are sloppy.
24	Q. Is the answer to my question yes or
25	no?
1	A. Yes. Self-selected polls are
2	unreliable, if by "unreliable," you mean you
3	want a representative picture of some larger
4	population. If you are just interested in
5	the people that actually hand in the sample,
6	then it is reliable.
7	I mean, there's no question that the
8	10,763 people who filled out this poll at
9	that moment in time, when they checked off
10	the box, while their teacher was glowering
11	at them, checked off the box they felt that
12	they should check off on the card, and you
13	can't say any more about it than that.
14	Q. You just said, "while their teacher
15	was glowering at them." Do you know if the
16	students actually completed this in the
17	classroom?
18	A. Well, they very likely did because
19	Senior Scholastic, I remember from my own
20	youth, was always distributed in class.
21	Q. But do you have any information
22	whether the students filled out this card in
23	class or whether they took it home and
24	filled it out elsewhere?
25	A. For some reason, I think I know
1	that, but I would have to double-check on
2	the source of that information.
3	Q. what do you think the source of that
4	information is?
5	A. I think it's mentioned in the Saad
6	article, but I would have to double-check.
7	Q. I would ask you to do that and let
8	us know. Do you know which class that this
9	particular card was given out in?
10	A. No.
11	MR. OGLE:
12	Excuse me. How do you want him to
13	let you know? You will have to remind him
14	or call us or call him or something because
15	if it just goes in the record, it could
16	easily be forgotten.
17	MS. LAWSON:
18	Well, it sounds like, from earlier
19	testimony today, he's going to have some
20	more things we are going to have to come
21	back and talk to him about from the Koballa
22	case.
23	MR. OGLE:
24	Just write a note.
25	MS. LAWSON:
1	Q. Write yourself a note.
2	A. what am I supposed to get you on
3	this one?
4	Q. I'd like to know what the source of
5	your information is that you believe the
6	card was handed out and completed by
7	students in the classroom, and I think you
8	said while their teacher was glowering at
9	them.
10	A. The glowering was -- okay, that part
11	was poetic license, is that what you want
12	to know, about the glowering?
13	Q. No. I don't want to know about the
14	glowering. I want to know the source of
15	your belief that the card was filled out in
16	the classroom with the teacher present and
17	watching.
18	A. Well, if it was in the classroom --
19	my understanding is it was filled out in the
20	classroom. And you'll look for the --
21	Q. That's what I want to know, the
22	source of that particular belief.
23	A. Sure.
24	Q. And we talked a minute ago about Ms.
25	Saad's article. Do you know if Mrs. Saad
1	had any contact with plaintiffs' attorneys
2	in smoking and health suits in preparing
3	that article?
4	A. I don't know either way. It may be
5	acknowledged in the article. I'd have to
6	refresh my memory.
7	Q. Would it make any difference to you
8	if she did?
9	A. No. I think it's a fair -- I mean,
10	her analysis is fair.
11	Q. Other than Mrs. Saad and the article
12	which you think she may have written, are
13	you aware of any other criticism of that
14	particular Senior Scholastic survey or poll?
15	A. Well, I mentioned your polling
16	expert, Tedin, T-e-d-i-n.
17	Q. Do you happen to know if the cards
18	that were filled out, where exactly in the
19	United States those cards came from, where
20	the students were?
21	A. I don't know the geographic spread.
22	Q. Does it make any difference whether
23	it was from all over the United States or
24	from any particular section of the United
25	States?
1	A. it would make a very big difference.
2	Q. What if it was from all over the
3	United States, would that make a difference?
4	A. Well, that would be better than just
5	being from, you know, Los Angeles and New
6	York, for example, if you wanted, you know,
7	something that was representative.
8	But, you know, the methodology is so
9	deeply flawed. The card is not really a
Page 127
10	poll, it's really an instructional device,
11	for that, which is very good. I think
12	there's educational value for students going
13	through the act of having to read materials,
14	maybe fill out a card and think about --
15	which forces them to think about smoking and
16	then the act of handing it in. That's good
17	for the individuals, but that's not a
18	scientific poll.
19	Q. Do you believe the card was used as
20	a part of a health instruction course for
21	students?
22	A. I don't know. I mean, I don't know
23	for sure, but it wouldn't surprise me.
24	Q. And that would mean that the
25	teachers were teaching the students about
1	smoking and health, wouldn't it?
2	A. That's right.
3	Q. Other than the sample or other than
4	this being a self-selection survey, do you
5	have any other criticism of the sampling
6	base?
7	A. Well, just that the sample is
8	completely non-representative of anything, I
9	have no other criticism.
10	Q. Okay. But, in truth, you don't know
11	if it's non-representative or representative
12	because you just don't know; is that fair to
Page 128
13	say?
14	A. No. That's not fair to say. It is
15	clear that it is not a scientifically
16	derived, statistically valid sample, it
17	doesn't matter if it was -- if the magazine
18	was distributed across -- to every county in
19	the United States or not. You know, you
20	fill out a card and you mail it in. That is
21	not -- you know, that's not a valid polling
22	sample. It just isn't. There's no way you
23	can get around that.
24	Q. So you think you could never have a
25	representative sample under those
1	ci rcumstances?
2	A. Not where it's self-selected. You
3	would not have a random scientifically
4	derived sample.
5	Q. Have you ever described the Senior
6	Scholastic survey or poll as -- in testimony
7	or in talking with plaintiffs' lawyers as
8	being done in classrooms?
9	A. I don't think so. No. I don't
10	think I've ever mentioned that. I've never
11	-- I don't think I've ever mentioned this
12	poll, except in my article, where I write
13	about it.
14	Q. Aside from the Senior Scholastic
15	magazine, do you know if any other
Page 129
16	periodicals ever discuss this particular
17	survey or poll?
18	A. I've just seen a couple of articles
19	from Senior Scholastic. No. I take that
20	back, it got picked up a little bit in the
21	newspapers. You can find -- and this is
22	within the industry documents, some
23	columnists picked it up. I'm not
24	remembering the exact name, but I had that
25	somewhere in my files.
1	Q. which newspaper do you think it was
2	picked up by; do you recall?
3	A. I don't. But that, too, I could
4	find for you.
5	Q. Okay. If you don't mind.
6	A. No. I'm happy to do that.
7	Q. Other than newspapers and Senior
8	Scholastic, do you know if it was mentioned
9	anywhere else?
10	A. I don't know. It may have been, but
11	I haven't come across it.
12	Q. Would it have any relevance to you
13	if any other organization cited that
14	particular survey or poll?
15	A. No. I mean, it -- I mean, you know,
16	people certainly could have talked about it,
17	and it wouldn't surprise me if public health
18	groups said, oh, great, you know, that
Page 130
19	doesn't change the fact that it's not a
20	statistically valid poll.
21	Like I said, go to the 1970
22	clearinghouse on smoking and health, the HEW
23	teenage poll, teenage smoking study. That's
24	done under a rigorous methodology. It would
25	be a better picture.
1	Q. Are you aware of any other polls or
2	surveys conducted on high school students or
3	teens in the 1959 time era about smoking and
4	health?
5	A. Boy, I think there's a 1959 Philip
6	Morris internal marketing study. I've run
7	across that. But at that particular time,
8	that's -- I can't think of anything that was
9	publicly available.
10	Q. Okay. Are you aware of any survey
11	done by Harvard University from that time
12	era?
13	A. Of Harvard University students?
14	Q. No, a survey conducted of teenagers
15	by Harvard University.
16	A. No. I missed that one. I haven't
17	come across that one.
18	Q. Are you familiar with a 1961 survey
19	done by the Saturday Evening Post on
20	attitudes of young adult Americans on
21	smoking and health?
22	A. I've never looked at that one, no.
23	I'm not familiar with that.
24	Q. Have you ever done any systematic
25	review of Senior Scholastic for smoking and
1	health information?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Okay. Describe for me what you did.
4	A. I went upstairs and went through the
5	-- went through the magazine.
6	Q. And was it in paper copy,
7	microfiche? What was it?
8	A. Paper.
9	Q. And what time period?
10	A. It began in the mid '50s and went
11	through the coverage of the Surgeon
12	General's Report.
13	Q. So you stopped in 1964?
14	A. Yes, a little bit after that.
15	Q. Okay. And what did you find?
16	A. I mean, they cover it. Particularly
17	in the '60s, it becomes an item and they do
18	cover it.
19	Q. So there are a number of articles
20	about smoking and health?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. And are those all on your reliance
23	materials, which would be current up through
24	Barbanell?
25	A. I didn't copy them all. I copied
1	this one and one other. I was just kind of
2	looking just for confirmation.
3	Q. So you only copied a couple of the
4	articles that you saw?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Any particular reason you didn't
7	copy the other articles?
8	A. I learned from them what I needed to
9	know. You know, to copy everything takes so
10	much time, you know, and you reach a point
11	of diminishing return.
12	Q. Do you know what the circulation
13	rates for Senior Scholastic were in the '50s
14	and '60s?
15	A. I don't have those at my fingertips,
16	but they do mention it on the masthead in
17	the magazine, but I can't remember.
18	Q. Was it a fairly wide circulation, to
19	your recollection?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. is it fair to say that Senior
22	Scholastic strongly discouraged students
23	from smoking?
24	A. By the '60s, especially, yes.
25	Q. Do you see that in the '50s, as
1	well?
2	A. Well, in this one, what's
3	interesting about this article is what you
4	might call the old fair imbalanced view.
5	They characterize a lot of coverage of the
6	1950s, which is -- it describes the American
7	Cancer Society's position, and then it goes
8	on to say what the industry's position and
9	gives, you know, a significant amount of
10	space that little burkes are mentioned. You
11	know, what are the facts.
12	So, just as my own feeling, and this
13	is more as a lay person and not as an
14	expert, I was surprised by the mildly
15	equivocal elements in the article. They
16	could have come down a lot stronger. But,
17	you know, they do state in that article that
18	smoking is linked to lung cancer.
19	Q. I just want to make sure that I
20	understand this. You have not had any
21	conversations with any plaintiffs' lawyers
22	about this particular 1959 Senior Scholastic
23	survey or poll or whatever you want to call
24	it?
25	A. Oh, I've talked to people about
1	this. People have asked me about it. I
2	have talked to them quite a bit.
3	Q. Okay.
4	A. I mean, since it's a common defense
5	exhibit. I mean, I've written an article
6	where I've discussed it, so I have talked to
7	attorneys about it.
8	Q. Well, other than in depositions, who
9	have you talked to about it?
10	A. I'm often asked about this by
11	plaintiffs' attorneys.
12	Q. Which ones do you remember talking
13	with about it?
14	THE WITNESS:
15	Does she want to know the content of
16	the discussions with the attorneys?
17	Q. I'm just asking which attorneys.
18	A. Most recently, I mean, I discussed
19	it with Mr. David Sayles. I discussed it
20	with a gentleman by the name of John
21	Hamilton. This is in the last month. Both
22	called to ask my position, to ask me to
23	explain the article to them. And,
24	basically, I told them the same thing I just
25	told you.
1	Q. what did you explain to Mr. Sayles
2	about the article?
3	A. The same thing I just told you
4	earlier, about the sample, and, you know,
5	all that discussion. I could say that
6	again, if you want me to.
7	Q. I just want to make sure I
8	understand the substance of what you said to
9	him. You told him it was a self-selection
10	survey, and it was unreliable for that
11	reason?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Anything else?
14	A. That's it. The first thing I say is
15	-- you know, I wrote about this in my data
16	control piece -- I mean, my tobacco control
17	piece. You can look at what I have to say
18	there, it's footnoted so they can go and
19	look at the citation. And, in fact, that
20	was the first thing I said to him.
21	Q. Okay. Are you aware of any polling
22	data on public opinion as to where people
23	get their smoking and health information?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Okay. Tell me what you are aware
1	of.
2	A. There's some industry polls where
3	they ask -- where they get their
4	information. They don't say smoking and
5	health, but where do you get your
6	information.
7	Q. Okay. And which ones can you think
8	of off the top of your head?
9	A. At the top of the list are
10	newspapers, then TV and radio. They list a
11	variety of organizations, public health
12	organizations, industry organizations.
13	Q. Are you aware of any polling data
14	that talks about who people believe are more
15	reliable, groups like the American Cancer
16	Society or the Tobacco industry Research
17	Council?
18	A. I've looked at polls like that.
19	it's been a long time, but, yes, there is
20	stuff out there like that.
21	Q. Okay. What's your recollection of
22	those polls?
23	A. Boy, this is -- I mean, this is
24	going back a while. I'd have to refresh my
25	memory on that. I have seen material
1	related to that, but I just can't recall.
2	Q. Do you recall if any of those polls
3	said that people believed the American
4	Cancer Society was more reliable than the
5	Tobacco Industry Research Council?
6	A. That may have been in the poll. I
7	just would have to refresh my memory on
8	that.
9	Q. So you just don't remember?
10	A. I just don't remember.
11	Q. Have you reviewed any polling about
12	public attitudes about the truthfulness of
13	television commercials?
14	A. No. That's not been a question I've
15	been interested in.
16	Q. Is it important to you at all
17	whether people believe television
18	commercials?
19	A. No, because I've always presented
20	television commercials as a historian. I
21	mean, there's -- you know, marketing people
22	have their uses, fulfilling two functions.
23	One, it's the manufacturer's communication
24	with his public, his or her dealing with the
25	public about the product.
1	But my position is television
2	commercials, indeed all advertising, helps
3	shape, at least in the period we're talking
4	about here, in the '40s, '50s, '60s, helped
5	shape America's cigarette culture by
6	projecting how to use the product,
7	situations in which one used the product.
8	Sometimes the advertisements make health
9	claims. There are examples of that. But
10	it's more than that.
11	And so, you know, ads may be true or
12	not true in that regard, and people may or
13	may not believe or disbelieve ads when asked
14	individually. But, you know, the kind of
15	saturation of American public life with
16	advertising, cigarette advertising, but
17	other advertising, as well, strongly shapes
18	our culture.
19	Q. Okay, would it be of any relevance
20	to your opinions if there were -- if there
21	was polling data in which the majority of
22	people responding said that they felt that
23	television commercials were untruthful?
24	A. No. I mean, I would be surprised if
25	people had said that they thought they were
1	truthful. That would have been a surprising
2	result.
3	Q. So you think people are skeptical of
4	advertisements?
5	A. I think people are skeptical of
6	advertising, yes. But advertising's power
7	is not in the individual messages, it's in
8	the repetition and its all-encompassing
9	nature.
10	Q. Are you aware of any polling data in
11	which people discuss what led them to begin
12	smoking?
13	A. Initiation -- well, the stuff I've
14	seen, there are things like where did you
15	get cigarettes, more focused on the
16	acquisition element. But there is stuff,
17	actually, on -- particularly industry files
18	where they poll people about initiation, you
19	know, so there is some good stuff in there.
20	Q. Okay. Are you aware of any polls
21	that specifically discuss whether
22	advertising played any role in people's
23	decisions to begin smoking?
24	A. I would be surprised if people
25	responded affirmatively that they smoked
1	because of a particular advertisement. That
2	would be surprising to me. And I would be
3	skeptical of that finding. That's not how
4	advertising works, at least as a historical
5	phenomenon. But I've not seen those
6	particular polls.
7	Q. Okay. Do you know what percentage
8	of the American public smoked in the 1940s?
9	A. Women -- there's a sharp increase in
10	prevalence in the 1940s, so certainly, by
11	the end of the '40s, women are approaching
12	the 30 percent mark. Men are in the --
13	they're in the 50 percent range. You know,
14	there's -- unlike consumption data, that
15	there's a certain variability to the data on
16	this because what is defined as a smoker,
17	sometimes the questions are regular smoker,
18	you know, sometimes the questions are, you
19	know, do you smoke more than two packs in a
20	week or -- so they give a quantity. So you
21	can get varying response. So the whole
22	issue of measuring prevalence has variation
23	to it, depending on the instrument you use.
24	That is the question.
25	In Milwaukee, the newspaper would
1	ask people, on a regular basis, if they
2	smoked, and, you know, they came up with
3	much higher rates. There's a 1955 current
4	population survey, which is very good, which
5	asks for precision. I think they had a
6	quantity that they asked, and that comes out
7	with the lower rate.
8	But, basically, you know, in the 50
9	percent range for men and, you know,
10	approaching the 30 percent range for women.
11	Q. So for the 1940s, your opinion would
12	be 50 percent range for men, approaching 30
13	for women?
14	A. Yes, depending upon what survey you
15	look at and how you measure it.
16	Q. How about the 1950s?
17	A. Prevalence goes up in the 1950s, and
18	continues to increase until the '60s and
19	then begins to decline.
20	Q. What's your understanding of the
21	percentage of people who smoked in the '50s?
22	A. You know, I've got these figures in
23	a table in my reliance documents, and, you
24	know, I feel much more comfortable referring
25	to that.
1	And, you know, you can go to the
2	"international Smoking Statistics," which is
3	a standard reference book, which is also in
4	my reliance documents, and get the exact
5	details on that, rather than for me to
6	misremember a particular number.
7	Q. It's fine to say I don't remember.
8	if that's the answer, that's fine.
9	A. Yeah.
10	Q. So is the answer, I don't remember?
11	A. I don't remember.
12	VIDEO REPORTER:
13	We need to change tapes, please.
14	MS. LAWSON:
15	All right. We'll stop.
16	VIDEO REPORTER:
17	This is the end of Tape Number 2.
18	The time is 2:28.
19	(Off the record.)
20	VIDEO REPORTER:
21	This is the beginning of Tape Number
22	3 in the deposition of Lewis Kyriakoudes.
23	MS. LAWSON:
24	Q. We're back on the record. I want to
25	ask you another question about your CV. One
1	of the courses you list that you regularly
2	teach is Tobacco in American History.
3	A. That's right.
4	Q. And that's an undergraduate course
5	in?
6	A. Well, it's a seminar that I've
7	offered, a special topic seminar. I'm
8	offering it again this spring.
9	Q. And how often do you teach it?
10	A. I've taught it one time before. I'm
11	teaching it again.
12	Q. What are your text for it?
13	A. The first time I taught it, I used
14	that book "Tobacco Cultures of Dependence"
15	and then lots of articles.
16	when I teach it this time, I'm going
17	to use Allan Brandt's book on "The Cigarette
18	Century." The last time I taught it,
19	Allan's book had not yet been released.
20	Q. Do you know Mr. Brandt or Dr.
21	Brandt?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Have you spoken with him about his
24	book?
25	A. Not in detail. He sent me a copy
1	when it came out with a nice inscription.
2	Q. Any other text that you plan on
3	using other than Dr. Brandt's book?
4	A. I haven't put it together. My
5	practice is to maybe have one book that they
6	buy and then assign sections or reserve
7	readings. You might recall that from your
8	college days.
9	But the kinds of things that I may
10	consider would be things like, since we do
11	tobacco in its all manifestations, there's a
12	large literature on colonial tobacco
13	cultivation. There's some good stuff on
14	cigarette agriculture. A guy named Anthony
15	Badger has a great book on the grower side
16	of the tobacco industry.
17	There's lots of article readings for
18	the course that I might draw from, studies
19	of marketing and tobacco control. Marvin
20	Goldberg has some good pieces.
21	There's a nice book by Sobel, "They
22	Satisfy," which is an older book, but has
23	some good stuff on culture that Allan
24	Brandt's book is not as interested in.
25	There's "Ashes to Ashes," Kluger's book,
1	which is also really good.
2	So I will suggest the students read
3	those kinds of books. I'll also use the
Page 144
4	industry documents as a tool for getting
5	them involved in the primary source
6	research. They can do all kinds of projects
7	out of that.
8	Q. Okay. I think in an earlier
9	deposition, you had testified that you had
10	been reviewing some Miami Herald articles;
11	is that right?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Have you done any additional
14	research in The Miami Herald in the recent
15	past?
16	A. No. Back in June, and that's
17	included, I sent that onto -- through the
18	channels.
19	Q. Okay. Are you planning to do any
20	research in any other Florida newspapers?
21	A. Well, last -- in the last
22	deposition, which was last week, which is
23	continued tomorrow, I had mentioned that I
24	had been reading in the St. Petersburg
25	newspaper, which is available through Google
1	Archive. And for me, access to these
2	documents is a significant issue. And I had
3	begun reading in that, and then when I
4	finished that, I would send that on.
5	Q. Any papers other than St. Petersburg
6	Times that you are planning to review?
Page 145
7	A. That's it.
8	Q. Why did you choose the St.
9	Petersburg Times?
10	A. it's available. You know, I mean, I
11	operate under time constraints.
12	Q. Okay. So is your choice of
13	newspapers to review determined by whether
14	they're electronically available?
15	A. Well, yes, if I'm going to look at
16	them. That's a significant -- you know,
17	fortunately, I mean, how research is being
18	conducted is being revolutionized by
19	computer technology, and that's -- when I
20	can avail myself of these efficiency
21	techniques, I do.
22	Q. Do you have any pictures that you
23	are planning to use in either the Koballa or
24	Lewis cases?
25	A. I do not.
1	Q. Are you planning on getting any
2	pictures to use in the Koballa or Lewis
3	cases?
4	A. I don't have any pictures of the
5	plaintiff or her family, their families. I
6	haven't -- I've had very limited contact
7	with the attorneys in these cases, it
8	comprises of a meeting this morning. So I
9	haven't discussed that with them. I don't
Page 146
10	know.
11	Q. Okay. I'm going to ask if you do
12	select some pictures that you plan to use,
13	if you would please provide them to counsel
14	so that they can be provided to us.
15	A. Yes. I believe firmly in the --
16	MR. OGLE:
17	And by that, you mean pictures other
18	than ads or something that you already have?
19	MS. LAWSON:
20	Exactly.
21	MR. OGLE:
22	Pictures, case-specific pictures.
23	MS. LAWSON:
24	Exactly.
25	MR. OGLE:
1	We'll definitely do that.
2	MS. LAWSON:
3	Q. And what I'm specifically referring
4	to, in past cases, you've used pictures of
5	the particular area where the individual
6	1ived.
7	A. That's right.
8	Q. And you've shown that to the jury,
9	and that's what I'm referring to.
10	A. Yes, absolutely.
11	Q. Now, I know you know Dr. Proctor.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Have you spoken with him recently?
14	A. Yes. I've talked with Robert.
15	Q. Okay, when did you last talk to
16	him?
17	A. I talked with him this weekend on
18	the phone.
19	Q. what did you all discuss?
20	A. We are -- I'm on a panel with the
21	History of Science Society, we talked about
22	that. It's coming up in November.
23	Q. Okay. Did you talk about anything
24	related to any of these smoking and health
25	suits?
1	A. No. No. I didn't talk to him about
2	that.
3	Q. Okay. Are you familiar with Dr.
4	Proctor's contacts with a professor at the
5	University of Florida?
6	A. I am now.
7	Q. Okay. Regarding research
8	assistants?
9	A. Yes. I'm familiar with this and
10	I've had discussions with attorneys who have
11	filled me in with just the basic outlines.
12	Q. Okay. Which attorneys have you
13	talked to about that?
14	A. Matt Schultz, of the Pensacola Levin
15	firm.
16	Q. when did you talk to Matt about it?
17	A. He called me this weekend.
18	Q. what did he tell you?
19	A. He said that they had had a hearing
20	on Friday, and that certain documents were
21	being subpoenaed from Mr. Proctor.
22	Q. Okay. Did you say anything to Mr.
23	Schultz about that?
24	A. I told him that, you know, that's --
25	I didn't really have any response. It
1	doesn't involve me.
2	Q. Do you know why Mr. Schultz
3	contacted you to ask you about it?
4	MR. OGLE:
5	Form objection.
6	A. Well, he told me about it. I have a
7	deposition with him next week, on the 1st of
8	September. That was the primary purpose of
9	the conversation. But this came up.
10	MS. LAWSON:
11	Q. Okay. Have you spoken with Dr.
12	Proctor at all about his contacts with this
13	professor at the university of Florida?
14	A. No, I haven't.
15	Q. I think you've testified in the past
16	about the use of holiday and Christmas
17	themes in cigarette advertising; is that
18	right?
19	A. That's right.
20	Q. Is it true that holiday and
21	Christmas themes were also used to advertise
22	other products?
23	A. That's true.
24	Q. And that would have been true in the
25	'40s and '50s?
1	A. That's true.
2	Q. And that would include other adult
3	products?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Do you know if there were Christmas
6	or Santa Clause advertisements for beer?
7	A. There were.
8	Q. Do you know if there were Christmas
9	or Santa Clause advertisements for razors?
10	A. It wouldn't surprise me. I have
11	seen the beer ones. I can't recall the
12	razor ones, but I wouldn't be surprised.
13	That sounds reasonable.
14	Q. Because that was just a theme that
15	was used during that time period?
16	A. That's right.
17	Q. And I think you've also testified in
18	the past about the use of comic book style
19	layouts in cigarette advertising?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. isn't it correct that there are a
Page 150
22	variety of products from that era -- and
23	again, I'm talking about the '40s and '50s
24	-- that used comic book style
25	advertisements?
1	A. Other products used comic book style
2	advertisements, that's true.
3	Q. Do you know what other products did?
4	A. I'm not bringing any particular one
5	in to mind, but toys, children's items.
6	Q. How about adult products?
7	MR. OGLE:
8	Form objection.
9	MS. LAWSON:
10	Q. You can answer.
11	A. I'm not thinking -- I'm not bringing
12	one to mind right now.
13	Q. Do you know if Ben-Gay ever used
14	comic book style advertisements?
15	A. That wouldn't surprise me.
16	Q. Would you consider Ben-Gay an adult
17	product?
18	A. it's a medicine, a topical, you
19	know, a balm, sure. You can use it on kids,
20	but it would be a parent that would buy it.
21	Q. Okay. Do you know if Mrs. Koballa
22	is still alive or if she's passed on?
23	A. I'm not recollecting.
24	Q. Okay.
25	A. I take that back. No. I don't
1	know. I didn't know it to forget it.
2	Q. That's fine. I want to ask you a
3	couple of questions about the e-mails that
4	you gave to me. I specifically want to
5	refer you to Page 9.
6	And I think earlier, your counsel
7	had said that there was an attachment that
8	they were not providing. Is that the e-mail
9	that had that attachment or your response to
10	the e-mail that had the attachment there at
11	the bottom of Page 9?
12	MR. HENK:
13	Just for the record, this is one of
14	the pages of Exhibit 3?
15	MS. LAWSON:
16	Exhibit 3. That's correct, it's
17	Page 9 of Exhibit 3.
18	A. Yes. Oh, yes. This is the one,
19	yeah. This is my response, yes.
20	Q. And can you tell me what you said?
21	A. You want me to read it?
22	Q. Uh-huh.
23	A. Or just sort of --
24	Q. You can read it.
25	A. Sure. "I don't know who's actually
1	going to show up to defend this four-case
2	depo, if anyone. I haven't heard from any
3	attorneys. I will say that the Koballa
4	summary below looks like privileged work
5	product. As soon as I saw what type of
6	document it was, I immediately stopped
7	reading it."
8	And then I go on to say, "Why you
9	sent this kind of material is a mystery to
10	me?" And then I put a question mark, which
11	I guess is inappropriate punctuation. "As
12	an expert, I don't need to be reading your
13	candid assessments of the strengths and
14	weaknesses of your case."
15	Then I say, "It puts me in a bind by
16	exposing me to work product that has no
17	bearing upon my expert opinions. I will be
18	handing it over to the defense, as per the
19	Schedule A, unless there is a human being in
20	the room to make an objection and physically
21	take custody of the document. Louis."
22	Q. Who sent you the e-mail that had
23	that particular attachment?
24	A. Someone named Tammy Todd.
25	Q. Do you know who Tammy Todd is?
1	A. She is just an e-mail address.
2	Q. Okay. And she's listed here, or at
3	least there's a signature block that says
4	she's legal assistant to Dennis Pantazis.
5	Do you know Mr. Pantazis?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Have you ever spoken with Mr.
8	Pantazis?
9	A. No.
10	Q. Do you know why Mr. Pantazis was
11	sending you information?
12	A. Well, they're handling, you know,
13	this -- I presume they're working with these
14	attorneys, even though his address is listed
15	as Alabama, on these cases. And the Tammy
16	Todd person was the person that, if you will
17	notice, sent me all of this material.
18	And, you know, to be honest with
19	you, that e-mail was occasioned by what I
20	thought was a lack of attention to what they
21	should be doing in preparation for this
22	deposition, a kind of sloppiness, and
23	sending me just kind of whatever, you know,
24	in terms of documents, particularly things
25	that are of no interest to me, you know. I
1	don't want to be cross-examined on, you
2	know, that kind of material because it's --
3	I'm not the lawyer.
4	Q. Okay. I think you referred to it,
5	you say, it looks like privileged work
6	product, is that what you called it?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. What's your understanding of
9	privileged work product, since you are not a
10	lawyer?
11	A. Well, I was using that as my
12	understanding, which was it looked like
13	materials -- I'm not violating their
14	attorney/client privilege here, but it was
15	materials written by the attorneys where
16	they were more than just kind of
17	summarizing, you know, like place of birth,
18	like interrogatories. But then, you know,
19	that was, like, the first part, just kind of
20	objective information, like it had been
21	taken off of the interrogatory page, and
22	then it went onto -- I saw that it said,
23	strengths and weaknesses, and I said, oh, I
24	don't want to know that.
25	Q. Do you know who wrote that
1	particular document?
2	A. No, I don't. I mean, I didn't -- I
3	mean, as soon as I saw that red flag, I just
4	shut that window on my computer and then was
5	a little -- as you can tell, it's a little
6	bit of -- not anger, but a little bit of
7	impatience with Tammy Todd, and so I sent
8	that e-mail.
9	Q. Okay. But you don't know whether it
10	was written by a lawyer or not written by a
11	lawyer, do you?
12	A. I don't know who wrote it.
13	Q. What did you mean by, "it puts me in
14	a bind"?
15	A. Well, you're asking me about it
16	right now.
17	Q. And this is a bind?
18	A. Well, in the sense that it's not
19	anything that I need to see, that I want to
20	see and to expose me to these things, you
21	know. And I get so many e-mails. I'm
22	buried in e-mails. I half read lots of
23	them, you know. It's hard to keep up.
24	And, you know, this came at the end
25	of, like, seven or eight e-mails that had
1	medical documents. And you will see there's
2	another e-mail that says, I don't need
3	these. I'm not a doctor.
4	So, you know, this was really a bit
5	of impatience with what I thought was
6	someone who wasn't really knowledgeable.
7	Maybe her name is Tammy -- I'm sure she's a
8	hard worker. I'm not trying to be critical
9	of a legal assistant. But you should pay
10	attention to these matters and, you know,
11	when I ask for a certain kind of
12	information, don't give me the whole case.
13	what, I'm going to sit there and plow
14	through that and read things that are not
15	relevant to my -- or beyond my expertise? I
16	can't read a diagnosis sheet or whatever
17	they're called. I'm not a doctor.
18	Q. Okay. There's another e-mail, it
19	looks like, that you also sent to Ms. Todd.
20	It says, "Whoever is defending this depo
21	needs to lodge an objection that the medical
22	records and case summary were sent to me in
23	error, that these documents have not been
24	examined or relied upon by Dr. Kyriakoudes
25	and that he need not produce them at depo.
1	will plaintiff's attorney be appearing by
2	phone?"
3	Did you write that?
4	A. Yeah. Well, I didn't know if anyone
5	was going to show up. And, basically, I
6	said, look, you know, if you ask for it and
7	there's nobody here to -- you are getting
8	it. That's basically another way of saying
9	that. I'm going to abide by the -- you
10	know, the Schedule A.
11	And so if they're going to send me
12	things that I don't need, I didn't ask for,
13	this is -- I'm not asking your question.
14	I'm the one that has to give the answer.
15	But there was a little bit of peep there in
16	those e-mails. I was trying to get the
17	attention of the person on the other end of
18	the line, rattle their cage so they would
19	wake up and pay attention to this.
20	Q. Do you know if this document, this
21	particular attachment that assessed the case
22	was sent to you in error?
23	A. Well, I mean, that requires me --
24	that kind of deals with intent of the person
25	sending it. That's my opinion, my feeling.
1	if they wanted to send me these documents --
2	maybe they wanted to send them to me.
3	Q. You just don't know?
4	A. Right. But it's not -- you know, my
5	understanding or my position is that that's
6	not the kind of document that I want to see,
7	and it's not something I rely upon and, you
8	know, it -- I read that first -- some
9	strength and weaknesses, as soon as I saw
10	that, you are going through quickly, and,
11	whoa, this is not -- this looks like lawyer
12	stuff that is not any of my business. It's
13	like getting the football play book, you
14	know. I don't want to see that because I'm
15	not the quarterback.
16	Q. Do you know how long the document
17	was?
18	A. It wasn't long. I think it was
19	maybe three to five pages, it was not a
20	long document.
21	Q. Do you know if it was -- which case
22	it was about?
23	A. I was going through it pretty quick.
24	No. I can't remember which case it was
25	about. One of the cases here, but I don't
1	remember which one.
2	Q. Okay. When you say "one of the
3	cases," would it be one of the four or one
4	of the two?
5	A. One of the four.
6	Q. One of the four?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. So you don't remember which one of
9	those four cases it was in?
10	A. Let me have the -- I'll tell you
11	that --
12	Q. Take the whole thing.
13	A. what it came with will tell me.
14	where is the attachment? it must have come
15	-- I'm pretty sure it was with Koballa,
16	because all of these e-mails are
17	Koballa-related, and it kind of came at the
18	end of a whole bunch of Koballa material.
19	This is the document right here, Koballa
20	summary, yeah. So it was Koballa.
21	Q. Was there factual information about
22	Mrs. Koballa within the document?
23	A. Well, the first portion of the
24	document, it kind of had, like, her date of
25	birth, you know, and her residential
1	history. Like I said earlier, like it had
2	been taken from the interrogatories.
3	And then there was the next section
4	or a subsequent section where I would
5	describe it as candid discussion of the case
6	of a legal nature, and when my eyes hit
7	that, I realized that I was not looking at
8	something that I, as an expert witness, am
9	interested in and wanted to -- should be
10	exposed to, should have any role in because
11	that's not my role in this.
12	Q. And we talked earlier about work
13	product. I think you called it privileged
14	work product?
15	A. I may have that wrong, but I think
16	I'm okay on that. I mean, that would be a
17	reasonable --
18	Q. That was your belief about it?
19	A. Yes. That's my belief.
20	Q. Did you believe the entire document
21	was privileged work product or did you
22	believe just some portion of it?
23	A. Well, like I said, the -- once I saw
24	the part that I thought was inappropriate, I
25	stopped reading it. But the first part had
1	basic objective information about where she
2	was born, that kind of stuff.
3	Q. And you didn't think there was
4	anything inappropriate about the first
5	portion of information that they provided to
6	you?
7	A. No. I read that part. I get the --
8	you have to understand, from my perspective,
9	that documents come in many different forms
10	to me, so sometime -- there's multiple forms
11	of interrogatories. I haven't quite figured
12	this out. So if it looks official, I just
13	figure it's official, you know, like some
14	court-generated document. And this one --
15	my interpretation was that this was not
16	that. But it took me about half a page to
17	learn that.
18	Q. Okay. But there was at least some
19	portion of it that didn't look like attorney
20	work product to you?
21	A. Well, that's a technical -- I'll
22	just say that the top portion had objective
23	information about Mrs. Koballa as opposed to
24	opinion.
25	MR. HENK:
1	May I interject here? Hopefully, it
2	will help, since I plan to ask questions
3	about it. Do we have the document here?
4	MR. OGLE:
5	Yes. I think we do.
6	THE WITNESS:
7	Yeah. It's in my computer. I mean,
8	I could -- you want me to print it off and
9	give it to you?
10	MR. OGLE:
11	You can give it to me, if you want.
12	I think it's premature, at this point, to -13	THE WITNESS:
14	I haven't deleted it from my -- I
15	mean, I printed these out this morning.
16	MS. LAWSON:
17	We would ask you to not delete it,
18	to please retain it.
19	MR. HENK:
20	Without having seen the document,
21	it's clear to me that part of it is that
22	there's no privilege objection to part of
23	it, and if we don't get to see it and look
24	at it today or ask questions, what we're
25	potentially guaranteeing is a second
1	deposition, when we can avoid that by
2	reviewing that portion of the document and
3	then having it produced to us in redacted
4	form.
5	MR. OGLE:
6	Let me ask this: Is there any part
7	of that document that you relied upon for
8	your opinion today?
9	THE WITNESS:
10	No, none whatsoever. As I said in
11	the e-mail, the response --
12	MR. OGLE:
13	Did any of that document form a
14	basis for your opinion today?
15	THE WITNESS:
16	No, none whatsoever.
17	MR. OGLE:
18	And I've already told you that this
19	was sent by a paralegal from Birmingham who
20	sent it by mistake, it should not have been
21	sent. It was an error to send it.
22	If you want to have a copy of that
23	document and read it, you are going to have
24	to get a court order to do it.
25	MR. HENK:
1	Okay. Well, maybe I misunderstood,
2	but I can go ahead and ask him, when it's my
3	turn, that I thought he was relying upon
Page 163
4	this information in Exhibit 4. And I
5	suspect, without having seen the document
6	that you are withholding, that that same
7	information is in the portion of the
8	document that's not privileged, so now he's
9	saying he's not relying upon it.
10	MR. OGLE:
11	That's not at all what he's saying.
12	MS. LAWSON:
13	I think we need to get back to a
14	question and answer format because this is a
15	deposition.
16	MR. OGLE:
17	Let me clear something up. I didn't
18	start this discussion, but let me clear this
19	up.
20	Doctor, this is not part -- what I
21	hold in my hand as Exhibit 4, is this part
22	of the document that you received, that
23	we're discussing today?
24	THE WITNESS:
25	No. I took some very brief, almost
1	pneumonic style memory notes as I was
2	reading Stella Koballa's deposition and as I
3	was reading Ms. Lewis's deposition, and then
4	very briefly, the Hetzner deposition.
5	MR. OGLE:
6	So this information came from her
Page 164
7	deposition?
8	THE WITNESS:
9	Yes. That's stuff I typed in,
10	myself.
11	MR. OGLE:
12	And all the biographical and
13	chronological information that you are
14	relying upon today, that you've discussed
15	and that forms the basis of your opinion
16	that you've given today, comes from Ms.
17	Koballa's deposition; is that right?
18	THE WITNESS:
19	Right. And there is an
20	interrogatory for the Koballa case, too. So
21	I got some of that from the official
22	interrogatories.
23	MS. LAWSON:
24	Q. Is this same information contained
25	in that first portion of the attachment that
1	we've been discussing?
2	A. I know it certainly listed her birth
3	date.
4	Q. where she lived, was that included?
5	A. I'd have to look at the document
6	agai n.
7	Q. That's fine. If you are saying you
8	don't remember.
9	A. when I realized the nature of that
Page 165
10	document, you know, I got out of there quick
11	because I thought it was inappropriate.
12	MR. OGLE:
13	I'll tell you, so what do you want
14	to do? I'm asking you. You want to see a
15	copy of the document that contains just
16	biographical information?
17	MR. HENK:
18	Yes.
19	MS. LAWSON:
20	it sounds like we're entitled to at
21	least a redacted portion of that document.
22	MR. OGLE:
23	I don't think you're entitled to it.
24	I don't agree with that, your being entitled
25	to it, at all. On the other hand, I can
1	have a look at the document, and if the
2	first -- without waiving any rights to
3	withhold any of the information which is
4	attorney work product -- and I think since
5	he didn't rely upon it, I don't think you
6	are really entitled to it.
7	On the other hand, for sake of
8	brevity, if you want to take the time, I'll
9	go have a look at it, and if it's just -- if
10	it's just biographical information, if you
11	want to have it -- I don't know why you
12	would want it, but if you want it, I'll be
Page 166
13	happy to give it to you.
14	MS. LAWSON:
15	why don't we take a break and let
16	you go look at it.
17	MR. OGLE:
18	But, I mean, the result of that is
19	we may not finish today, because I have
20	questions, as well. But it's up to you. If
21	you want to take your time. This is your
22	time. You're paying for it. So if you want
23	to take your time to do this, I'll be happy
24	to do it.
25	MR. HENK:
1	When you say, "not finish today,"
2	what time constraint are you referring to?
3	MR. OGLE:
4	I don't have a time constraint. I
5	mean, I understand you have an airplane to
6	catch. I mean, we'll finish tonight. I
7	mean, I don't know how long we'll go. I
8	don't know how long I'm going to be because
9	I don't know all your questions. But I do
10	know I have some questions, based on what
11	you've already asked. So if I'm going to
12	review this document, it's going to take
13	some time. It's up to you.
14	MS. LAWSON:
15	Let's go off the record right now.
Page 167
16	MR. OGLE:
17	I think it needs to stay on the
18	record.
19	MR. HENK:
20	it's a paragraph.
21	MR. OGLE:
22	Well, I don't know what it is. I
23	don't know. I mean, you are the one that
24	wants to see it. You are the ones asking me
25	to do it. I'll be happy to do it.
1	MS. LAWSON:
2	I don't think you can assert whether
3	it's privileged unless you've actually
4	looked at it.
5	MR. OGLE:
6	Well, I understand, from what he's
7	told me, I know enough. I'll be happy to go
8	look at it, if that's what you want me to
9	do.
10	MR. HENK:
11	Yes, absolutely. Attorney
12	Kyriakoudes said he thinks it's privileged,
13	but we want to see --
14	MR. OGLE:
15	Well, I think he's correct about it.
16	I know a little history. He knows a lot of
17	law.
18	MR. HENK:
19	You start with the assumption that
20	anything given to an expert is
21	non-privileged.
22	(Off the record.)
23	MR. OGLE:
24	This is Bill Ogle. I've had the
25	opportunity to review the document we were
1	discussing before we went on break. And
2	this reminds me of a time when I was
3	litigating a case and there was a lawyer for
4	the defense who mistakenly hit the wrong
5	button and e-mailed me his report that he
6	was planning to send to his insurance
7	company. So rather than read it, I
8	immediately sent it back to him and
9	explained what had happened.
10	So, I mean, if you don't want to do
11	us that courtesy, I will be happy to tell
12	you what's in this report but -- in summary,
13	but I'm not going to give it to you.
14	This is entitled, Koballa Summary.
15	it consists of two pages, it does not have
16	a date of birth on it. it does not have a
17	place of birth. It doesn't have any
18	geographical information, it just has the
19	name Stella Koballa and Robert Koballa. it
20	does give the illnesses and the types of
21	surgery and treatment.
22	And from then on, it goes to
23	describe the attorney's impression of the
24	case, it gives positives and negatives of
25	the case, from the plaintiff's point of
1	view, from our point of view. It gives
2	different factors that are going to be at
3	issue in the case, it gives a list of
4	witnesses that we want -- and I'm saying
5	this without waiving any right to retain
6	this information -- notable facts, and it's
7	basically a document -- it's an outline to
8	the file for our analytical purposes.
9	MS. LAWSON:
10	Can you tell us who drafted it?
11	MR. OGLE:
12	I have no idea, it doesn't say who
13	drafted it. I'm sure it was one of the
14	attorneys on our team who drafted it. And
15	somehow the paralegal -- Tammy Todd is a
16	paralegal in the office of Dennis Pantazis,
17	and she must have thought she was sending an
18	interrogatory answer that would be a public
19	document, when, in fact, she was sending the
20	impressions on the outline and the plans of
21	the attorneys.
22	So I'm absolutely not going to turn
23	this over. If you don't believe me and you
24	really want to have this document seen, for
Page 170
25	whatever reason, I can't imagine, because
1	there's nothing on here that he would have
2	relied upon. It has nothing to do with his
3	testimony today. But if you insist upon it,
4	we'll be happy to turn it over to Judge
5	Parsons, let Judge Parsons have a look at it
6	and determine whether or not you would be
7	entitled to have it.
8	Maybe he -- some of the things, if
9	you wanted to go through redacting, he'd
10	have to redact large portions of it, and
11	then the stuff that's not redacted is the
12	stuff you already know, the name Stella
13	Koballa and Robert Koballa. There's nothing
14	really on here that I can imagine that would
15	be of any interest to you or of any
16	relevance to the deposition today.
17	But that's what it is. it literally
18	gives our outline of the positives and
19	negatives of the Koballa case, and I'm not
20	giving it to you unless the court absolutely
21	orders me to do it.
22	MS. LAWSON:
23	Are you asserting a Work Product
24	Doctrine?
25	MR. OGLE:
1	Yes. I'm asserting a work Product
2	Doctrine and that this document was sent
3	totally by error, it was a mistake that was
4	made in one of the law offices and should
5	not have been sent and it's not to be turned
6	over.
7	MS. LAWSON:
8	Okay, well, we will reserve the
9	right to bring that up with Judge Parsons
10	later.
11	MR. OGLE:
12	That's fine. You don't need to
13	reserve it. You always have that right.
14	MS. LAWSON:
15	I understand that, but I just need
16	you to understand that we may be asking for
17	it because it was sent to him.
18	MR. OGLE:
19	You may do that, we're not going to
20	-- it wouldn't be destroyed, in any event.
21	So it's there, if you want Judge Parsons to
22	look at it, we will be happy to have him
23	look at it.
24	MS. LAWSON:
25	And we would ask, professor, that
1	you retain that.
2	THE WITNESS:
3	I'll retain that.
4	MS. LAWSON:
5	Q. And while we were on break, you
6	provided me, professor, with a copy of a
7	letter sent to you from Dawn
8	Vel1ejos-Nichols of the Avera & Smith firm;
9	is that correct?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. And when you were telling me earlier
12	about a cover letter that accompanied a
13	retainer check, this is the particular
14	letter you were talking about?
15	A. That's right.
16	MS. LAWSON:
17	Let's mark this as the next exhibit.
18	(Exhibit 8 was marked.)
19	MS. LAWSON:
20	Q. Do you know when Ms.
21	val1ejos-Nichols first contacted you?
22	A. what's the date on that letter?
23	Q. June 18th.
24	A. It would have been just before then.
25	Q. Okay.
1	A. I never spoke with her. I spoke
2	with a guy named Rod Smith or Smith, and he
3	actually came out here and visited with me
4	in Hattiesburg late May, early June,
5	something like that, and discussed his
6	cases.
7	My mentioning of that letter was
8	occasioned by the fact that I thought the
9	Hetzner was part of this set of cases.
10	Q. it was noticed for today, and we
11	found out later that it wasn't going to
12	be --
13	A. Yeah. And so that letter is
14	relevant to Hetzner. I've been informed by
15	these gentlemen that they're not the same
16	law firm as this particular law firm.
17	MR. OGLE:
18	I don't think Hetzner was noticed
19	for today.
20	MS. LAWSON:
21	I'm sorry. You are right. It was
22	Hibner.
23	MR. OGLER:
24	Hibner and Humpal.
25	A. A strong prevalence of H names --
1	MS. LAWSON:
2	Confused everyone.
3	A. Two-syllable H names.
4	MR. OGLE:
5	Like heaven.
6	A. Like heaven. So, really, there's
7	nothing -- that letter is what it is and you
8	are welcome to it. And it's marked, but
9	it's -- I guess it's not really relevant to
10	this proceeding here.
11	MS. LAWSON:
12	Q. Okay. Have you charged Mr. Ogle or
13	his firm or any other lawyers working on the
14	Koballa case or the Lewis case a retainer
15	for your services?
16	A. In retrospect, I don't think I have.
17	And that's probably my oversight. But it's
18	not that big of a deal because, you know, my
19	idiosyncratic use of retainer is really just
20	an advance on hours, and so the time I've
21	spent reading these materials and then
22	subsequently, you know, advising and
23	discussing with them would simply be added
24	up and billed for that.
25	Q. Okay. So you don't plan to charge
1	them a retainer fee?
2	A. No. Because we've already had
3	deposition. You know, and, again, just to
4	be clear, you know, what I call a retainer
5	is really an advance on the work I'll do,
6	really, to get ready for the deposition and
7	subsequent pre-trial activities. I don't
8	bill for just a fee in its own right.
9	Ultimately, there's an hour of work applied
10	to each unit.
11	Q. I'm trying to find the best way to
12	say this. How soon after performing
13	services do you typically provide an
14	i nvoi ce?
15	A. Typically, I go back and, you know,
16	after I testify in the trial, if the trial
17	is scheduled within a reasonable amount of
18	time, if not, sometimes these things get
19	knocked off the docket and kicked over into
20	the future, I just then bill at that point.
21	You know, when I've kind of
22	accomplished a kind of phase of work, if you
23	will, you know, like you prepare for a
24	deposition and if the trial is coming up,
25	you do the trial and then you just send it
1	in one bill.
2	If you prepare for the deposition
3	and you are talking and think it's kicked
4	into the next quarter or the next year, then
5	I'll say, well, you know, I've done a bunch
6	of stuff, so I'll sit down and send a bill
7	in for that.
8	Q. For most cases, has it been your
9	practice to wait until after the case is
10	tried before you send the bill?
11	A. Again, it just depends on the time
12	frame. Usually, there's -- things move
13	pretty quickly, and so I just kind of put it
14	all together at the end, yes.
15	Q. So would it be fair to say that's
16	what's happened in most cases, is you've
17	billed after the case has gone to trial?
18	A. Yes, that's most cases. Some have
19	never gone to trial and so then I've billed
20	for that.
21	Q. Okay. Now, is it fair to say that
22	you don't plan to offer any opinions in the
23	Koballa case that are specific to Mrs.
24	Koballa?
25	A. Well, I mean, that's awfully broad,
1	the way you characterized it that way. I
2	may talk about, you know, her time and
3	place, and the world in which she grew up
4	in. But it is true, I'll be consistent, as
5	I have been in other trials. I'm not going
6	to tie her -- I'm not her biographer, so I
7	don't know what she, as an individual, may
8	have known.
9	Q. Would your response be the same for
10	Mrs. Lewis?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And you've recently provided trial
13	testimony in a couple of cases called Martin
14	and Campbell. Do you recall?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Do you recall that most of your
17	testimony consisted of showing juries in
18	those cases copies of advertisements?
19	A. That's true. That was a significant
20	portion of the presentation.
21	Q. Do you intend to give similar
22	presentations in the Koballa case or a
23	similar presentation in the Koballa case?
24	A. You know, I -- it just depends what
25	-- you know, in consultation with the
1	attorneys, what they want me to discuss and
2	what they want to ask me. I could certainly
3	do that or I could do what I call the more
4	traditional public knowledge discussion, you
5	know, so it's up to them as to what they
6	want to ask me. I'm certainly prepared to
7	do both, one or the other.
8	Q. Okay, would your response be the
9	same for Lewis?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. Other than what we've discussed here
12	today, is there any other work you plan to
13	do for the Koballa case?
14	A. No.
15	Q. Other than what we discussed here
16	today, is there any other work you intend to
17	do for the Lewis case?
18	A. No.
19	MS. LAWSON:
20	I think that's all of the questions
21	I have right now. I'm sure Pete has some.
22	I will pass off the microphone to him.
23	EXAMINATION
24	BY MR. HENK:
25	Q. Good afternoon, Dr. Kyriakoudes.
1	A. Good afternoon.
2	Q. We've never met before, have we?
3	A. I don't think so.
4	Q. You've met quite a number of my
5	partners.
6	A. I have, yes, over the years.
7	Q. Okay. Well, just for the record, my
8	name is Pete Henk, and I represent Philip
9	Morris USA. You understand that?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. I'm not going to ask you all that
12	many questions, but if I do not ask a
13	question and specify that it's specific to
14	the Koballa case or the Lewis case, will you
15	then understand that it applies to both
16	cases and that your answer will apply to
17	both cases?
18	A. Yes. That sounds like a good
19	efficiency move.
20	Q. It will cut my questions in close to
21	half. I believe you said you met with Mr.
22	Ogle for about 20 minutes this morning; is
23	that correct?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. And I apologize if you explained
1	this, but I didn't gather this, what was
2	the content of the conversation that you
3	had?
4	A. Polite introductions, directions to
5	the I-Hop for David Lee. And I actually, I
6	discussed this issue that was just discussed
7	in this room. I said, you know, just to let
8	you know, in case he was unaware of the
9	summary document, I mentioned that to him.
10	Q. Okay. The document you've referred
11	to as being privileged?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Okay. Your current hourly rate is
14	$400 an hour; is that correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. And if I understand this, are you
17	going to create an invoice for these cases
18	or not?
19	A. Yes. Yes. I always send out an
20	invoice, yes.
21	Q. But you don't do it until the end of
22	the case?
23	A. Well, I described that earlier. You
24	know, when are these scheduled to go to
25	trial?
1	Q. Well, Mr. Ogle would be the best
2	guide, but I think one is scheduled in --
3	MR. OGLE:
4	November.
5	A. This is -- yeah, I'll probably just
6	-- because I'm going to be communicating
7	with them, and it wouldn't surprise me if on
8	a weekend, on a Saturday, I met with them to
9	help prepare the presentation, you know,
10	prior to the trial. That would all be, you
11	know, time that I would charge for, and then
12	at the end of the case, I would add all that
13	up and submit it.
14	MR. HENK:
15	Q. So, in other words, will you prepare
16	the invoice before you testify or after?
17	A. Well, I -- after because I don't
18	know how long I'm going to be on the stand.
19	Sometimes I'm on the stand for a day.
20	Sometimes, it goes onto the next day.
21	Q. So there's no written record of the
22	time you've spent or will be no written
23	record of the time you spent on these cases
24	through the time you testify at trial,
25	correct?
1	A. That's right. Because it's -- it's
2	pretty straightforward. You know, most of
3	the time that I bill for is, you know, when
4	I travel or the time that I, you know, read
5	to prepare for these depositions.
6	Q. Well -- and I was going to ask about
7	that. You don't bill for all of your time
8	that is worked that could be called in
9	connection with these cases, correct?
10	A. Well, that is true. And, you know,
11	it's -- I'll be frank with you on this. You
12	know, when I got into this, I had no
13	guidance on what are acceptable practices.
14	At one point, I think I -- you know, I
15	overreached on the rate and then adjusted
16	because of that.
17	And then I thought about, you know,
18	how do I want to handle this with my
19	professional life? Because I've published
20	on this subject. And so I've just taken the
21	position that primary source research that I
22	conduct on my own time, I don't charge
23	anybody for. That is part of my own thing.
24	Now, on occasions, I've hired a
25	research assistant and I've paid them, and
1	while I pay them out of my pocket, I do --
2	that is reflected in the bill, if it's case
3	relevant stuff. So I do do that. But I
Page 182
4	haven't done that that much.
5	So that's just how I've done it
6	because I'm trying to balance a lot of
7	competing concerns. You know, I do this
8	venue and -- but I also have my professional
9	life, so I have to, you know, kind of
10	balance those.
11	Q. Have you ever produced an invoice
12	for time that you've billed on an Engle
13	progeny case? "Produced," by that, I mean
14	to the defense counsel.
15	A. No. I haven't brought one with me.
16	Do you want them?
17	Q. I'm just asking, have you ever done
18	that?
19	A. No. I have in the past, before the
20	Engle -- one time, I showed up to a
21	deposition with my 1099s. We blacked out my
22	social security number and photocopied them.
23	That's true.
24	Q. How much income have you made from
25	your work in Engle progeny cases this year,
1	in 2009?
2	A. Well, it's been busy, it's been --
3	for what I've actually been paid for,
4	because that's another issue. I don't
5	always -- I'll send out the invoice, it
6	doesn't always result in a check coming back
Page 183
7	to me.
8	I've done -- it's been about -- I'm
9	going to include the depositions, as well.
10	It's approaching, this year, about $75,000.
11	Not quite that, but almost there. That's a
12	ball -- back of the envelope.
13	Q. That includes trial time?
14	A. Yes, everything.
15	Q. And that $75,000 through, say,
16	August of 2009, what percentage of your
17	total income this year in 2009 would the
18	$75,000 be?
19	A. Well, this year, I mean, it's about
20	my salary, so it's been -- you know, I've
21	never been this busy. For years, I would do
22	one case a year or something like that, and
23	all of a sudden, it has exploded.
24	Q. So your income from work on Engle
25	progeny cases this year, to date, through
1	August of 2009, is more than 50 percent of
2	your total income, correct?
3	A. This year, yes. That's never been
4	the case before.
5	Q. Since the testimony you've given in
6	depositions and trial in Engle progeny cases
7	so far this year, have you formed any new
8	opinions specific to Philip Morris USA?
9	A. I'm sorry. Could you repeat the
Page 184
10	question? I had a little bit of a -- just a
11	lapse in concentration.
12	Q. Sure. Since the time you've given
13	deposition testimony and trial testimony in
14	Engle progeny cases this year, have you
15	formed any new opinions with respect to
16	Philip Morris USA?
17	A. No. Since my last deposition or
18	last testimony? Is that what you are
19	asking? I'm unsure as to exactly what you
20	are asking, time wise. Clarify the time for
21	me. I might -- I might be just missing you
22	because it's in the afternoon.
23	Q. Right. I'm really asking it more
24	broadly than for -- Campbell was your last
25	trial testimony, correct?
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. And I'm not trying to limit it just
3	to since Campbell.
4	A. Okay.
5	Q. What I'm trying to ask more broadly
6	is, have you formed any new opinions with
7	respect to Philip Morris USA that you have
8	not expressed in the depositions and trials
9	to date in Engle progeny cases?
10	A. I understand. No, I haven't. Sorry
11	about that.
12	Q. That's all right. I may not have
Page 185
13	worded the question very well. And I'm
14	sorry. I'm going to be flipping around here
15	a little bit.
16	A. That's okay.
17	Q. You testified a few minutes ago, in
18	response to a question by Ms. Lawson, about
19	whether you had opinions that were specific
20	to the Koballa and Lewis smokers, and you
21	said, well, you might have things to say
22	relative to time and place. And I just want
23	to ask you, if you testify about facts
24	relative to time and place pertaining to
25	Koballa and Lewis, you don't view those as
1	opinions, do you?
2	A. Sure. I mean, it's not my
3	professional opinion when she was born or
4	where she was raised. That would be
5	accurate.
6	Q. Well, when you say sure, I think --
7	I'm not sure that was responsive to the way
8	I was asking the question.
9	A. Okay. I'm trying to be responsive
10	on this one.
11	Q. I may have -- I may have lost track
12	of what I asked. But, in other words, if
13	you are testifying to where Koballa and
14	Lewis were born, where they went to school,
15	when they started smoking, you don't
Page 186
16	consider those to be opinions, do you?
17	A. No. Those are facts of the case
18	that are clearly laid out in the evidence
19	presented in the case, in the depositions.
20	I mean, there may be conflicting evidence.
21	But this might help you. What I
22	meant by that, you know, I may be asked, and
23	I think I did this in the Martin case, to
24	talk about what America was like in the
25	1930s or America was like in the 1940s. And
1	that's really what I was thinking about when
2	I responded to the earlier question that you
3	referenced.
4	Q. Okay. So you do not intend to give
5	an opinion at trial that is specific to the
6	smoker in the Koballa case, correct?
7	A. Right. In a sense, you know, I have
8	never, say, for example, testified that,
9	well, so and so knew formidably something at
10	a particular point in time, any particular
11	individual who was either the plaintiff in
12	the case or the smoker in question. I've
13	never been the biographer of any plaintiff
14	or smoker in litigation and I don't intend
15	to change that policy at all.
16	Q. And the same goes for, obviously,
17	for the smoker in the Lewis case, correct?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. Can I have Exhibit 3? I'm sorry,
20	actually 4.
21	Doctor, let me show you what's been
22	marked as Exhibit 4. And could you identify
23	what notes you made with respect to Stella
24	Koballa?
25	A. Yes. At the top of the sheet of
1	paper, I wrote down some things to help
2	prick my memory, repeat my memory as I
3	underwent the deposition.
4	Q. And could you kind of walk through
5	what it is that you identified?
6	A. Yeah. I'm -- rather than reading it
7	verbatim, I'll just tell you what I put
8	down. Stella Koballa, I put that she was
9	born in 1933 in Tower Hill. Then I write
10	down Brownsville, PA. That's reference to
11	the place that she grew up. And then later,
12	she moved to Montgomery, Alabama, then
13	Cleveland, and then Daytona Beach.
14	15, 16 refers to when she began
15	smoking, circa 1952, and the testimony
16	reflects that she smoked a variety of
17	brands, including Lucky Strike, Tarrington,
18	Bel air and Basic.
19	Q. And why is it that you decided to
20	make those particular notes with respect to
21	Ms. Koballa?
22	A. Originally, this deposition was
23	going to be four cases, and rather have what
24	happened last week, where I was very good on
25	one case and not so good on the second case,
1	and the questioning attorney felt the need
2	for me to come back, in essence, and do it
3	over again. And the inconvenience, the
4	expense involved in that, I thought I would
5	do this so that I would be able to answer
6	your questions more effectively.
7	Q. Okay. And it's not easy to keep
8	track of the facts with respect to these
9	different smokers, correct?
10	A. That's true. And a complicating
11	factor in this one was the materials were
12	delivered to me on the 18th of August, so
13	the materials came to me rather late. Today
14	is the 24th, you know, and it's been a busy
15	week and my -- in fact, my wife has been out
16	of town, so I've been watching the kids by
17	myself, too.
18	So that's the purpose of that, is to
19	help me keep on track and focus. And if you
20	can see, I actually included Carol Hetzner,
21	which I thought was going to be part of this
22	deposition, Lewis. And then the Humpal, the
23	other two, I just simply wasn't able to get
24	to those materials, and, in fact, indicated
Page 189
25	such to the attorney this morning, which I
1	might add completes the answer to your
2	earlier question about the morning
3	discussion, and said, I'm just not in a
4	position to answer questions on that and so
5	there's no point in trying to depose me on
6	those other cases. And that i'll make
7	myself available. That's fine. But I had
8	reached the ability, the capacity had been
9	reached.
10	So this is just a way to speed
11	things along for you guys and to make it
12	more efficient for you.
13	Q. is it fair to say that with respect
14	to the items that you wrote down for Stella
15	Koballa in Exhibit 4, that those are the
16	only facts from what you reviewed that you
17	found to be relevant?
18	MR. OGLE:
19	Form objection.
20	A. I mean, that wouldn't be accurate
21	because I wrote this down more as a kind of
22	a shorthand to just help me remember, as
23	opposed to a kind of complete note-taking on
24	the case.
25	But it is true that, you know, given
1	my testimony and what I have said earlier
2	today about the specificity of my opinions
3	relating to any particular individual,
4	that's enough. That places her in
5	historical time and place and that really is
6	enough, really, for me and for my opinions,
7	as a historian.
8	Q. That's why I thought it was fair for
9	me to say that, so let me ask it
10	differently.
11	what are the facts about Ms. Koballa
12	that you think are relevant to your
13	opinions?
14	MR. OGLE:
15	Form objection.
16	MR. HENK:
17	What is the form objection?
18	MR. OGLE:
19	what is a form objection? it's a
20	form objection to the form of the question.
21	Well, it's vague. It's overly general. It
22	calls for a narrative answer. It calls for
23	a summary of all the facts that he would
24	rely upon. It's an improper question.
25	MR. HENK:
1	I don't think he thinks there are
2	very many facts that are relevant to his
3	opinions.
4	Q. But go ahead and answer, subject to
5	the objection.
6	A. Well, I mean, I've never made any
7	secret about the fact that my expertise is
8	primarily as a historian of the tobacco
9	industry and its actions, and as a historian
10	of what the American public knew and
11	understood about the risks of smoking at
12	certain points in historical time. And I
13	have been reluctant, always, to make an
14	affirmative judgment about any particular
15	plaintiff and what they may or may not have
16	known, done, should have done, did.
17	And so your question was fair, and
18	I'll answer yes, that this, you know, with
19	maybe a few minor exceptions on the margins,
20	represents what I thought was most essential
21	about Ms. Koballa, for my purposes, as an
22	expert witness in this case.
23	Q. And Dr. Kyriakoudes, when you say
24	this, of course, you are referring to the
25	notes in Exhibit 4, correct?
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. And I'm sure you know what my next
3	question is going to be. You said there are
4	a few things on the margin. So do you have
5	anything in particular in mind that you
6	would describe as being on the margins that
7	might be relevant to you?
8	A. No. I only said that because, you
9	know, as I go back over the depositions in
10	preparing the case, in preparing my
11	discussion, I don't want to close off, you
12	know, some characteristic, you know. I
13	don't want to close myself off to
14	discovering something new in the deposition.
15	But I will be consistent, as I think
16	I have been in all of the other cases that
17	I've testified in, about the extent to which
18	I can make affirmative judgments about a
19	particular individual, which is limited,
20	given the documentary record at hand.
21	Q. Okay. And so would you suspect that
22	any item, factual item that might be on the
23	margin wouldn't be of a nature that would be
24	significant, where you would expect that we
25	would have to have further examination on
1	the subject?
2	A. I would agree with you. It's not
3	going to be that way.
4	Q. And let me -- I don't want to
5	nitpick, but just mathematically speaking,
6	here, if Ms. Koballa was born in 1933, and
7	she started at age 15 or 16, that would not
8	be 1952. Which of those dates is correct?
9	In other words, meaning 1952 or 15 to 16?
10	A. The 15 to 16 is what I gathered from
11	the deposition. I don't know how I got the
12	'52 in there. That was just an error. I
13	don't -- I mean, even I'm not that bad with
14	numbers.
15	Q. Might it be that 1952 is when she
16	became a regular smoker?
17	A. Oh, well, maybe, you know, in my --
18	that might be the case. I would have to
19	remind myself. Maybe that's where I got
20	that. I was reading these things quickly,
21	again, because I had limited time resources.
22	That may be the case, if she testifies that
23	she said that, that must be where I got that
24	from. But I'd have to just double-check.
25	Q. Okay.
1	A. I mean, and just to clarify this, I
2	mean, if you want to represent to me that
3	that's in the testimony, I'll be okay with
4	that, and maybe I could answer your next
5	question.
6	Q. Well, probably like you, I feel
7	comfortable representing on things that I've
8	actually looked up myself, and so I'm not
9	going to do that.
10	A. Fair. Fair enough.
11	Q. The Basic, Basic brand cigarettes,
12	that's what you've mentioned on Exhibit 4.
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. And what is significant to you, if
15	anything, about Basic brand cigarettes to
16	the point that you wrote that down?
17	A. It was just mentioned in her brand
18	discussion. And I think there was also an
19	interrogatory where it was listed, listed or
20	discussed the brands. And she also
21	mentioned it in the deposition, it's just
22	the last thing she smoked. There's not --
23	to me, Basic is not particularly significant
24	except that it's the last brand that she
25	had.
1	Q. Okay. And with respect to Ms.
2	Lewis, what are the facts that you put in
3	Exhibit 4?
4	A. Well, hers were -- I put down less
5	for two reasons. One, I was very familiar
6	with the places that she had lived, just
7	from my own personal experience. Part of my
8	youth was spent in the town of Commack,
9	which is right next to Dix Hills, Deer Park
10	and those places out there in Nassau,
11	Suffolk County.
12	For her, I remembered I didn't have
13	to write down as much, simply because I
14	remembered her smoking initiation in the mid
15	'60s, her description of doing it in high
16	school, so I just didn't need as much to
17	remind me. This was really a memory device
18	as it is -- as opposed to kind of strict
19	note-taking.
20	Q. Okay. Well --
21	A. And hers was the last one I read,
22	too, so it was freshest in my mind.
23	Q. Okay. And everybody's mind works
24	differently, but what you did write down is
25	what you were already very familiar with.
1	what you didn't write down are the facts
2	that you wouldn't be familiar with from
3	prior work. Those would be the
4	case-specific facts, such as when she
5	started smoking?
6	A. I remembered that. And I did
7	discuss that earlier and was able to answer
8	those questions with a reasonable degree of
9	competency.
10	Q. Well, time will tell on that.
11	A. Fair enough. I'm not a historian of
12	the plaintiff, and I'm insistent on that.
13	Q. You have described the 1964 Surgeon
14	General report as a major public health
15	event, correct?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. And the 1964 Surgeon General report
18	was covered by all of the mass media, right?
19	A. As far as I see, yes. I've seen
20	nothing to indicate otherwise.
21	Q. I'd like to ask you about Exhibit 3.
22	I think it was at Page 9, Christine?
23	MS. LAWSON:
24	Page 9.
25	MR. HENK:
1	I didn't realize they're marked at
2	the bottom, is it fair to -- let me ask
3	you, in Exhibit 3, the e-mails that you
4	sent, were you giving advice to counsel?
5	MR. OGLE:
6	Form objection.
7	A. Well, I was -- I guess you could --
8	you could say that. I'm not a lawyer. I
9	don't pretend to be a lawyer. I -- as I
10	said earlier, I was -- when I came across
11	that document, after a long list of, you
12	know, having my in box flooded with
13	irrelevant medical documents, as well, that
14	I had to sort through, I was a little -- you
15	know, a little angry. It's fair enough for
16	me to describe it that way, and I think the
17	sharpness of the e-mail reflects that. And
18	I wanted the person on the other end of the
19	e-mail to pay attention to this, and so I
20	worded things to the point, and sharply.
21	As I said earlier, I just didn't
22	want -- this was not anything that should
23	have been sent to me, and I didn't want to
24	see it. My personal interpretation of how
25	I've handled myself, and this is that it put
1	me in a position that I chose not to be in,
2	that I don't want to be in, in the sense
3	that I don't want to look at what their
4	evaluation of their case is. That's not my
5	business. It's not my role. And so I said
6	-- I don't think they knew what they sent
7	me. You know, this is -- you know, if I
8	were you, kind of, this is what I would do.
9	You sent me something that -- whose ever
10	sent it to me didn't know what they were
11	doing.
12	Q. You wanted to do what you could to
13	protect that document from being disclosed,
14	correct?
15	A. No. I was giving them that advice
16	-- my primary interest was protecting
17	myself, you know, to be cross-examined on a
18	legal work product document for which I have
19	no interest, I should not legitimately see,
20	that I should not have looked at, that I did
21	not completely review. Once I saw that it
22	was radioactive, so to speak, and I just
23	wanted to get the heck out of there as
24	quickly as possible.
25	I don't have control over my in box.
1	People send me stuff. I don't read it all.
2	But, you know, I'm trying to, as quickly and
3	expeditiously, prepare for this deposition
4	under time constraints, and then have to
5	deal with this. I was a little angry. I
6	think I had a legitimate right to object to
7	them in language that -- it's polite, but
8	it's to the point, you've made a real error
9	here.
10	Q. Did anyone respond to any of your
11	e-mails to say that the document was sent to
12	you in error?
13	A. No. No. I haven't gotten -- I
14	mean, I have submitted -- given you all the
15	e-mails.
16	Q. Okay. So you assumed that the
17	document had been sent in error, correct?
18	A. Well, right. I mean, nobody said --
19	my interpretation is that I shouldn't have
20	seen -- that that document shouldn't have
21	been sent to me. You don't have to be a
22	lawyer to know that when there's a document
23	and you read -- you know, read on the first
24	page this kind of discussion, you know, that
25	it's attorney work product.
1	I mean, I've known that from reading
2	some of the industry documents that were
3	privileged attorney work product and thus
4	they were released. So it's -- you know,
5	it's not something that I wanted to see for
6	this case because that's -- I'm not an
7	advocate and I don't want to see the
8	advocate language.
9	Q. Has attorney mental impressions
10	never been disclosed to you, even orally?
11	A. Oh, you know, people will say stuff,
12	but I'm -- you know, I am one piece. You
13	know, I don't get -- it's not my role to
14	determine the outcome of any of these.
15	That's the jury or the judge, if it's a
16	judge. And I am just one piece of this. I
17	have my expertise.
18	But, you know, there are medical
19	issues and legal issues, and all other
20	issues that are not my interest and are not
21	in my competency that play significant roles
22	in determining the outcome of this case, any
23	case, all cases. And there's not enough
24	time in the day for me to keep up on that.
25	I'm not interested in it.
1	I really -- you know, my job is to
2	represent my research to the jury through
3	the forbearance of the judge who allows me
4	to be in there, and I want to protect that.
5	Q. Do you want the plaintiff to prevail
6	in the Koballa and Lewis cases?
7	A. I don't have an opinion either way.
8	I don't know enough about the law. I don't
9	know enough about the medical testimony. I
10	mean, I've testified in cases in which
11	defense has been the outcome of the verdict
12	or the verdict has been the defense verdict
13	and I've testified in cases in which the
14	outcome has been a plaintiff verdict.
15	Q. It doesn't make any difference to
16	you?
17	A. it really doesn't because I am just
18	one piece of a larger puzzle, so to speak.
19	And I don't think it should make a
20	difference to me or any expert.
21	Q. Oh, I agree with that. You
22	mentioned that you spoke with Dr. Proctor
23	this weekend, correct?
24	A. That's right.
25	Q. You mentioned that you spoke with
1	Matt Schultz this weekend, correct?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. And when you spoke with Matt
Page 201
4	Schultz, you learned about documents being
5	subpoenaed from Dr. Proctor, correct?
6	A. Yes. In the course of our
7	conversation, mentioned that there had been
8	a hearing, I guess, on Friday.
9	Q. And you spoke with Matt Schultz
10	prior to speaking with Dr. Proctor this
11	weekend, correct?
12	A. No. Actually, I talked with Robert
13	-- I think I talked with Robert on Friday
14	evening, and I think I talked to Matt
15	Schultz on Saturday, something like that.
16	Q. And Dr. Proctor did not mention
17	anything to you about these documents being
18	subpoenaed; is that right?
19	A. That's right. I don't want to -- we
20	have a professional relationship, you know,
21	in terms of our -- you know, we've worked on
22	the data project together and we've -- we're
23	doing a panel together, the History of
24	Science Society. And just as a matter, as a
25	rule, I don't want to talk to him about this
1	because you are going to ask me about it.
2	And I just don't want to have to, you know,
3	be in a position to have to talk about it
4	with him.
5	Q. Why don't you want to talk about it?
6	A. Well, I mean, I'll speak frankly. I
Page 202
7	think we have a -- I disagree with -- I
8	don't know all the facts in this business,
9	but that's not something I would have ever
10	pursued, and I think the distractionary
11	trouble -- I'm not sure all that's been gone
12	on, but I think that's evidence of the
13	wisdom of not doing that.
14	Q. What would you not have pursued?
15	A. I would not have -- I would not have
16	identified research assistants as anything
17	that would have ever been of interest to me,
18	to know about them as people, to talk to any
19	of their teachers or anything like that.
20	Q. And why would you not have done
21	that?
22	A. Because I'd be asked about it by
23	someone like you, and I'd rather not have to
24	-- you know, there's no point to it. It's a
25	distraction, it -- research assistants are
1	people that help you get your work done, but
2	the work, the opinions, the research is done
3	by the Ph.D. experts. And I've made my
4	position on that very well-known through my
5	writings.
6	And so there's no question about
7	where I stand on my appraisal of the methods
8	and materials, opinions of the expert
9	witnesses who have testified on behalf of
Page 203
10	the tobacco industry, at least the ones that
11	I studied in my article. I made no bones
12	about that.
13	But I'm just not interested. As I
14	said in the Barbanell deposition, you know,
15	somebody who's in graduate school, you are
16	broke, you are just trying to make some
17	extra money so you can eat meat once a week
18	or pay the rent or maybe you've got kids or
19	whatever, and that's just not anything I
20	would want to do. I would never want to
21	involve them, nor would I want you to do the
22	same for the undergraduate that I've hired
23	this summer to help me do some photocopying
24	and basic research.
25	Q. Your conversation with Matt Schultz
1	was two days ago, correct?
2	A. Saturday, yes.
3	Q. And can you tell me, as best you
4	can, verbatim, what Matt Schultz told you
5	about Dr. Proctor?
6	A. Yeah. He said that there was a
7	hearing on these issues that have come up in
8	all the depositions that I've had since
9	June, or whenever the Barbanell deposition
10	was, and that a number of documents were
11	being subpoenaed from Dr. Proctor on the
12	part of the judge because of this.
Page 204
13	Q. Because of what?
14	A. Because of his contact with faculty
15	at the university of Florida on the issue of
16	research assistants being hired by experts
17	advising the tobacco industry in its defense
18	in lawsuits.
19	Q. Okay. And what else did he tell you
20	about the situation with Dr. Proctor during
21	this phone call?
22	A. That's it. That's it.
23	Q. So how long did Matt Schultz speak
24	with you Saturday about Dr. Proctor?
25	A. It was about maybe two, two or three
1	minutes. Most of the conversation was about
2	the upcoming deposition on the 1st of
3	September.
4	Q. Did you wonder why Matt Schultz was
5	telling you what was happening with Dr.
6	Proctor?
7	A. No. I asked him.
8	Q. Okay. Why did you ask Mr. Schultz
9	what was happening with Dr. Proctor?
10	A. Because I knew -- I mean, there's no
11	secret that there was a hearing on Friday
12	about these issues. I had been asked about
13	it in depositions. So I was just curious.
14	Q. Okay. But even though you spoke
15	with Dr. Proctor on Friday, the same day as
Page 205
16	the hearing, you didn't speak with Dr.
17	Proctor about the issue, correct?
18	A. I don't think he -- well, he didn't
19	-- he didn't bring it up. I mean, I talked
20	to him Friday afternoon. That hearing may
21	not have even been over, you know. I don't
22	know what time this hearing was held on
23	Friday. But he may not have even have
24	known, but we didn't talk about it.
25	Q. How many conversations total, ever,
1	have you had with Dr. Proctor?
2	A. Ever, like in my life?
3	Q. Yes.
4	A. I don't know. I can't -- we talk a
5	couple three times a month, sometimes more,
6	sometimes less, depending upon what we're
7	working on. And when I say "working on," I
8	mean scholarly things.
9	Q. Have you ever spoken with Dr.
10	Proctor about the situation that led to the
11	subpoenaing of the documents?
12	A. After I was asked in the -- you
13	know, it came up in a deposition called
14	Barbanell, which I'm sure you are aware of.
15	And I asked him about it, just in a general
16	way. I told him that I was asked about
17	this. That's all. I just let him -- I
18	informed him.
19	I've tried -- you know, because of
20	this, you know, we've not really spoken a
21	lot; only on a kind of necessity basis to
22	handle the logistics of the History of
23	Science Conference, so I've kind of kept my
24	distance.
25	Q. So you've had one conversation with
1	Dr. Proctor about the situation?
2	A. Pretty much, yes, and just in a
3	general way, just to let him know that, you
4	know, he came up in a deposition.
5	Q. And how did Dr. Proctor respond when
6	you told him that?
7	A. He said -- he thanked me for that,
8	and that was it.
9	Q. Do you know why he thanked you?
10	A. No. I mean, you know, he just said,
11	appreciate it, you know. And I said then,
12	you know, I don't like to talk about the
13	litigation because I'm -- you know, I'm in
14	this scenario, and I have to answer you
15	guys, and I know you are going to ask about
16	that kind of stuff, so I try to keep an
17	arm's length. So it's been very limited.
18	Q. Do you believe that what Dr. Proctor
19	did was inappropriate or do you think it was
20	appropriate but you just don't want to have
21	to talk about it?
22	A. I'm not exactly sure what -- I mean,
23	I don't have the full facts. I will say
24	this: I think it is wrong to interfere with
25	somebody else's research assistants. I
1	don't think that's right. I think that's
2	inappropriate. I don't know that that's
3	what he did, and you all are working on
4	that, so -- and that's not my business in
5	that regard. But I don't think it's -- it's
6	not something I would have ever thought to
7	do, is to, you know, make contact with
8	faculty members that way. I would have
9	never done that. Because, I mean, you've
10	got to be -- you've got to be above board on
11	this thing.
12	And from a practical matter, I mean,
13	what does it accomplish? I mean, it could
14	be the end of no troubles. I mean, the
15	start of troubles, I meant to say.
16	Q. You believe the situation relative
17	to Dr. Proctor to be a serious one?
18	MR. OGLE:
19	Form objection.
20	A. Well, again, I don't know what the
21	facts of the matter are. I really don't.
22	But, you know, if a judge issues a subpoena,
23	that's a serious matter. And that's a
24	serious matter that has nothing to do with
Page 208
25	one's expert opinions or their research or
1	their scholarly activity. So that, right
2	there, enough is -- if you needed more
3	evidence to just leave that area alone, you
4	know, what more persuasion do you need? I
5	mean, a subpoena is a serious matter.
6	MR. HENK:
7	Q. Have you ever had any e-mail
8	communications with Dr. Proctor about this
9	situation?
10	A. Not that I can -- not that I can
11	recall. I don't think so, no.
12	Q. Dr. Proctor never sent you any
13	e-mails about this situation that led to the
14	documents being subpoenaed?
15	A. He -- no. He's not -- I've had no
16	conversation about any of these hearings or
17	anything with him on e-mails, none of this
18	stuff going on in Volusia County with the
19	judge, no e-mails on that whatsoever.
20	Q. Just the way you answered that, I
21	didn't intend my question to be particularly
22	narrow. I intended it to be broad. You are
23	confident that Dr. Proctor has not sent you
24	any e-mails that pertain to the subject
25	matter that led to the subpoenaing of the
1	documents; is that correct?
2	A. No. That's not correct. After this
3	happened, after I was asked in the Barbanell
4	case, I went and searched my e-mails and I
5	found an e-mail or -- that he had forwarded
6	to me, which I had not -- skimmed over and I
7	wish he had never forwarded it to me, but
8	where he -- it was a communication between
9	him and Betty Smocovitis. And I did find
10	that in my e-mail box, and I was not aware
11	of that e-mail or recalling that e-mail when
12	I was asked about it in the Barbanell case.
13	Q. Okay. And this e-mail that you were
14	just talking about, have you testified about
15	that previously?
16	A. No. This is just here. This is
17	something I went back and looked and it kind
18	of -- the Barbanell case, I was asked about
19	these issues. I had no knowledge of them,
20	you know. I had no anticipation or
21	preparation for this particular line of
22	questioning, so I answered those questions
23	as truthfully as I could.
24	But, afterwards, I went back and
25	searched, and he had forwarded an e-mail to
1	me, which I'll happily supply you.
2	Q. Okay. And that was going to be my
3	next question.
4	VIDEO REPORTER:
5	Could we change tapes?
6	MR. HENK:
7	Sure.
8	VIDEO REPORTER:
9	This is the end of Tape Number 3.
10	It is 4:08.
11	(Off the record.)
12	VIDEO REPORTER:
13	This is the beginning of Tape Number
14	4. We're back on the record at 4:09.
15	MR. HENK:
16	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, we were just
17	talking about an e-mail that you received
18	from Dr. Proctor. Do you recall the date
19	that the e-mail was sent to you?
20	A. I don't. I can -- I think the best
21	thing, I mean, I have no secret on this
22	e-mail, if I pull it out of my machine, I
23	could answer those questions affirmatively.
24	Q. Okay. Where did you find it
25	specifically on your machine?
1	A. Well, I went back to my computer
2	after -- you know, the Barbanell case, as I
3	said, I didn't know about these things and I
4	didn't know about these things. But I went
5	back and searched my in box on Google, who I
6	use GMail, and I found in there a letter
7	that he had forwarded to me, which was a
8	letter he had written to Betty Smocovitis.
9	And I felt terrible about that,
10	really bad about that because I didn't
11	realize I had that in there. I mean, I get
12	so much stuff, I skim through it and I just
13	didn't recollect it. And I can't tell you
14	exactly what it says right now, but I can
15	get it, and you can read it and we can
16	ascertain its contents.
17	Q. When you said that you wished he
18	hadn't sent it to you, what did you mean by
19	that?
20	A. This whole business of getting
21	involved in a department's activities like
22	this is just -- it's caused no end of
23	trouble. I mean, this is trouble. You
24	know, a subpoena by a judge on your
25	materials is trouble.
1	it accomplishes nothing, it's -- I
2	don't think it's right. I think it's
3	incorrect. I think it's wrong to do that.
4	And it's not something I would have ever
5	done. And I think it was wrong.
6	I mean, I have done this for a long
7	time. I'm well-known in this line of
8	endeavor. I have never done anything like
9	that because I -- it achieves no purpose. I
10	don't know that he did anything wrong, from
11	an ethical standpoint. But for me, just as
12	a practical matter, I think it's -- you
13	know, it's not anything I would have ever
14	done.
15	MR. HENK:
16	I think at some point, here, I'm
17	going to want to take a break and confer
18	with counsel, so I don't know if now is a
19	good time.
20	MR. OGLE:
21	it would be a good time. I want to
22	take a break, too.
23	VIDEO REPORTER:
24	We're going off the record. The
25	time is 4:12.
1	(Off the record.)
2	VIDEO REPORTER:
3	We're back on the record at 4:51.
4	MR. HENK:
5	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I'm going to hand
6	you two documents. Actually, let's go ahead
7	and mark them first.
8	(Exhibits 9 and 10 were marked.)
9	MR. OGLE:
10	I hate to interrupt because we just
11	took a long break, but if we are going to be
12	examining him on this, it would be nice if
13	we all had copies to look at as we did that.
14	MS. LAWSON:
15	You want to go off the record for a
16	minute and we can impose on you for copies?
17	(Off the record.)
18	VIDEO REPORTER:
19	Back on the record.
20	MR. HENK:
21	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I've handed you
22	what's been marked as Exhibit 9 and Exhibit
23	10. And starting with Exhibit 9, could you
24	describe that document for us?
25	A. This is what I was referring to
1	earlier, when I said that after I had been
2	asked about this matter in the Barbanell
3	trial, I went back, as just kind of a due
4	diligence, and searched my e-mail, and
5	discovered a couple of e-mails in there that
6	I had not recollected in the Barbanell and
7	actually had not actually read carefully
8	prior to Barbanell; hence, the lack of
9	recollection.
10	But I identified to you, because you
11	asked, and I had known about it now, and so
12	I printed these out of my computer and I've
13	supplied them to you.
14	Q. Okay. And you were just testifying
15	about Exhibits 9 and 10; is that correct?
16	A. That's right.
17	Q. And both documents are two-page
18	documents?
19	A. Two-page e-mails that are e-mail
20	exchanges between Robert Proctor and Betty
21	Smocovitis. How do you pronounce that?
22	MR. OGLE:
23	Smocovitis.
24	A. Smocovitis, sorry. One of whom
25	which is -- I guess he copied me on one or
1	just sent to me without any -- Exhibit
2	Number 10 without any commentary, and then
3	one dated the 23rd of May, where he says,
4	"Note my exchange with Betty Smocovitis."
5	Q. And let me ask you about what you
6	just testified about. You said that you
7	found the e-mails, Exhibit 9 and Exhibit 10
8	after your trial testimony in Barbanell; is
9	that correct? Or was it your deposition
10	testimony?
11	A. No, the deposition -- sometime after
12	the deposition. Not immediately after, but
13	a few weeks later, I searched "Proctor" and
14	found these, and had not recollected them in
15	the Barbanell, so I brought them -- you
16	know, you asked me about them today and I
17	identified them to you.
18	Q. Okay. And when you -- after your
19	testimony, deposition testimony in
20	Barbanell, do you recall that being June
21	25th?
22	A. Something like that, yes.
23	Q. After you gave that testimony on
24	June 25th and you found Exhibits 9 and 10,
25	did you realize that you had given
1	inaccurate testimony in your Barbanell
2	deposition?
3	A. Yes. Yes. Because I did not -- to
4	the extent that I did not recollect getting
5	these e-mails. I can't remember if they
6	asked me if I got any e-mails or not, but I
7	just -- I had been asked about this, and I
8	didn't know about it in Barbanell, and I
9	didn't know about it. I was answering
10	truthfully.
11	But when I went and happened upon
12	these e-mails, I realized that these should
13	be something that I should -- you know, were
14	relevant to this, and certainly in the
15	spirit of the question.
16	Q. Okay. And prior to today, did you
17	bring to anyone's attention that you had
18	given inaccurate testimony in your Barbanell
19	deposition?
20	A. No, to no one.
21	Q. And why is that?
22	A. Well, I wasn't sure what to do about
23	it. You know, I found these e-mails -- I
24	mean, the inaccuracy is, you know, what did
25	I know, and I didn't recollect anything in
1	Barbanell. I found the e-mails, I found
2	them sometime in -- after the 4th of July
3	because I went on a family vacation for the
4	4th of July. And I wasn't sure what to do
5	with them, you know.
6	And to be honest with you, I've been
7	wanting to do something with this. I mean,
8	you asked me a question and I identified
9	them to you. So I -- you know, I try my
10	best to be as accurate as possible in these
11	proceedings.
12	Q. You don't feel that Exhibits 9 and
13	10 were responsive to any questions that Ms.
14	Lawson asked today; is that correct?
15	A. I don't think so. I would have
16	identified them to her.
17	Q. And you don't believe Exhibits 9 and
18	10 were responsive to the question that I
19	asked you immediately prior to the question
20	that you answered and identified them; is
21	that correct?
22	A. Well, that was all kind of one
23	question. I mean, once you asked me about
24	them, I answered more narrowly, but then
25	when you said, this is more broadly, then I
1	said, well, I've got these e-mails.
2	Q. Did you review at any point in time
3	the transcript of your testimony, your
4	deposition testimony in the Barbanell case?
5	A. I haven't yet reviewed that, no. I
6	guess I could do that and parse it out, you
7	know.
8	You know, at the end of the
9	Barbanell case, I was asked about these
10	matters. I answered to the best of my
11	ability. I believed I was answering
12	truthfully. And I -- you know, I don't feel
13	the need to go back to Barbanell, you know.
14	I discovered these in July, you
15	know, mid to late July, when I was looking
16	for them. I mean, not when I was looking
17	for them, but when I was, you know, wanting
18	to find anything like this to make sure that
19	I was okay on this, and I found these and
20	was disconcerted to find these in my e-mail
21	box.
22	MR. OGLE:
23	You know, I need to take just about
24	a ten-minute break. I apologize for that.
25	Let me just take a quick break.
1	VIDEO REPORTER:
2	We're going off record at 5:02.
3	(Off the record.)
4	VIDEO REPORTER:
5	We're back on the record at 5:18.
6	MR. HENK:
7	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, how familiar are
8	you with computers? I mean, how would you
9	describe yourself, just generally speaking?
10	A. Competent. I'm familiar.
11	Q. Are you aware that there are ways to
12	check whether e-mails have been opened or
13	not by the recipient of an e-mail?
14	A. There may be, yes.
15	Q. You've heard about that?
16	A. Yeah. I mean, mark as read, mark as
17	unread, yes.
18	Q. In other words, you've heard that
19	there are ways that people can check, after
20	the fact, to find out whether somebody
21	opened an e-mail or not, correct?
22	A. I didn't know that, but I don't
23	dispute that. I'm not that familiar with
24	computers, I guess.
25	Q. And focusing on Exhibits 9 and 10,
1	did you open those e-mails prior to June
2	25th, 2009?
3	A. You mean, before the Barbanell
4	deposition?
5	Q. Yes.
6	A. My recollection is that this one was
7	opened, but this one wasn't opened. And
8	when I say this one was opened, that's
9	Exhibit Number 9, and Exhibit Number 10 was
10	not opened.
11	Q. Okay. And can you explain why
12	Exhibit 9 was opened but Exhibit 10 was not
13	opened prior to your Barbanell deposition
14	testimony?
15	A. Because I was completely unaware of
16	Exhibit Number 10. I didn't even know that
17	was in the e-mail box. That came up after
18	the -- you know, in late July. I forget
19	exactly.
20	But I did it after I was asked a
21	second time in a deposition by -- in New
22	Orleans. I forget the name. It was the
23	Grossman case. And they asked me again
24	about this, so I went back and checked. And
25	this one had been opened and -- Number 9,
1	and Number 10 hadn't been opened.
2	Q. So, in other words, when you went
3	back and checked for Exhibits 9 and 10,
Page 220
4	following your Barbanell deposition
5	testimony, you were able to discern from
6	looking in your box which of these two
7	e-mails was opened?
8	A. Well, in GMail, one is bold, dark
9	bold if you haven't read it yet, and one is
10	not in dark bold if you have -- have clicked
11	on it.
12	Q. Okay. And let's start with Exhibit
13	9. That e-mail was addressed to you,
14	correct?
15	A. Yes. It's a forwarding of another
16	e-mail, a long list of correspondence
17	between Robert Proctor and Betty Smocovitis.
18	Q. But the e-mail was addressed to you,
19	correct?
20	A. Yes. There's a little comment up at
21	the top. It says, "FYI, my recent exchange
22	with Professor Betty Smocovitis, at the
23	University of Florida, a history of science
24	colleague. Note her astonishment."
25	Q. And is the address that Exhibit 9
1	was sent to, is that your business address
2	or your personal address?
3	A. That's my personal GMail account.
4	Q. Do you know why Dr. Proctor was
5	sending you an e-mail to your personal
6	account?
7	A. I don't use my university e-mail
8	address for much of anything. That has a
9	lot to do with the -- to be honest with you,
10	to put it basically, the deficient e-mail
11	system.
12	Back in 2005, I sent -- 2006, I sent
13	some edits on an article from my USM.edu
14	e-mail address, and the system was down, and
15	those edits never arrived, and the little
16	article was published without the edits.
17	And I swore then never to use USM e-mail
18	agai n.
19	So I use GMail for everything. I
20	talk to my students through GMail. My USM
21	e-mail is automatically forwarded to my
22	GMail account. I like it. it's easier to
23	use. it's a better system. I wish the
24	university would go to GMail.
25	Q. Okay. When you -- after May 23rd at
1	4:24 p.m., did you respond in any way to
2	Exhibit 9?
3	A. No. No. This is the complete --
4	there's no response to this at all. I did
5	not respond to it. I hit the -- on GMail, I
6	hit the "print thread" button on this.
7	Q. And by response, I mean not only via
8	e-mail, but did you respond to this
9	communication, Exhibit 9, in any fashion?
Page 222
10	A. No. Spoken, none whatsoever.
11	Q. What did you think of Exhibit 9 when
12	you opened it?
13	A. Oh, when I first -- I didn't read
14	the whole thing. I skimmed through it and
15	then -- and just passed on it. it didn't
16	seem to be anything that I should concern
17	myself about.
18	Q. What is your understanding of why
19	Exhibit 9 was sent to you?
20	A. Robert likes to keep track of -- or,
21	you know, monitor who has testified for the
22	tobacco industry, and I do that too. I
23	mean, that was why I sent him the original
24	deposition, in the first place, of Mr. Gregg
25	Michel. Just simply said, here's another
1	expert testifying for the -- you know, for
2	the defense.
3	I wrote an article on it. He wrote
4	an article on it. we collaborated on a
5	table in his article. I helped him compile
6	a table of historians, professional
7	historians, professors who had served as
8	experts. There's nothing secret about that.
9	So when there was another testifying
10	expert, I sent him that e-mail with the
11	Gregg Michel deposition, which had been
12	forwarded to me by David Sayles. And David
Page 223
13	Sayles sent it to me solely in his capacity
14	in representing his client in the Campbell
15	case and without any other purpose other
16	than that. So I sent it off to him.
17	I had not read it, except for, like,
18	the first two pages, to find out who the
19	person was. Apparently, he read it and
20	discovered in it this information about the
21	University of Florida, and that's -- then he
22	acted on that on his own accord.
23	Q. What did you do with Exhibit 9 after
24	you opened it?
25	A. I clicked on it, I read a little bit
1	of it, I passed on it because it just didn't
2	seem to be anything important. I get a lot
3	of e-mails, and I'm, you know, really, you
4	know, very busy and, you know, I don't study
5	every e-mail that I get. And I decide
6	whether it's something I need to act on or
7	not.
8	You know, most of the e-mails I get
9	are my work e-mails, where I have to call
10	somebody and respond to somebody in my
11	capacity as director, and so that's what I
12	really act on. Other stuff, I just kind of
13	skim through and move on.
14	Q. After you opened Exhibit 9, did you
15	move that e-mail to any other box in your
Page 224
16	computer system?
17	A. No. No. That would indicate that,
18	I think, on the heading if it had been filed
19	in a box, but I didn't.
20	Q. So, for example, you did not delete
21	Exhibit 9 after you opened it?
22	A. No.
23	Q. Why did you not delete it if you did
24	not find it to pertain to anything?
25	A. You know, I mean, that takes --
1	that's another decision you've got to make.
2	And I don't mean to be flippant, but you are
3	kind of going through this stuff and you are
4	looking for stuff that you have to -- for
5	work. Oh, you know, you just pass on it.
6	Periodically, I'll go through and
7	I'll kind of clean out my e-mail box. I'll
8	search for, like, New York Times, Google
9	Alert, and do these kind of mass deletions,
10	where you delete like 150 e-mails, just to
11	clean up the box. But, no, I didn't delete
12	that one. I just skimmed through the first
13	part of it and then moved on.
14	Q. Approximately how many e-mails are
15	in your in box today?
16	A. New e-mails?
17	Q. No. Total.
18	A. Oh, it's a lot. I mean, it's
Page 225
19	Google, so -- I used to delete my e-mails,
20	then Google says you don't have to delete
21	them. I downloaded all my e-mails from
22	Google in, like, the summer of 2007, not
23	understanding what I was doing, which I
24	downloaded them to the POP server, which
25	meant that they all went onto my computer
1	and off of the Google server and my computer
2	just was full. But I -- you know, there's
3	thousands on there, you know, all my work
4	correspondence, personal correspondence. So
5	it's a lot.
6	Q. Your e-mail in box is not set on any
7	automatic delete after, for example, 30
8	days?
9	A. Uh-uh. No. I don't have that.
10	Q. Okay. It's not on any sort of
11	cycling system; is that correct?
12	A. That's -- I didn't know they had
13	that. So, no, it's not on a cycle.
14	Q. And Exhibit 10, can you explain how
15	you received that e-mail?
16	A. This was the one that I found that I
17	hadn't read that I didn't know even -- ever
18	know that was in my box. This was -- I
19	guess I'm just copied on it because there's
20	no -- it's not really to me. It's an e-mail
21	between Robert Proctor and Betty Smocovitis.
Page 226
22	Q. So you think you were cc'd on
23	Exhibit 10; is that correct?
24	A. I think -- that's what I think
25	Robert did. That's what I would guess.
1	Q. And does GMail not normally indicate
2	who the cc's are?
3	A. Well, I mean, you see how it's
4	addressed. I mean, that's all I can --
5	that's all I can -- the only way I can
6	describe it.
7	Q. Well, I'm not -- of course, it's not
8	my deposition, but I'm not at all familiar
9	with how GMail works, but you are, correct?
10	A. Yeah. I'm pretty familiar.
11	Q. So all I know is, you are not in the
12	"to" field, correct?
13	A. Right.
14	Q. Your name and e-mail address is up
15	at the top right of Exhibit 10, correct?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And what, if anything, does that
18	indicate to you as to how you would have
19	received Exhibit 10?
20	A. Well, it came to my GMail address.
21	There's no question about that because it's
22	in my in box. You know, I -- I mean, that's
23	what's in the e-mail box. I printed it.
24	It's clearly printed. I printed the whole
Page 227
1	say about that part of it.
2	Q. I'm just trying to understand it.
3	Like I said, I'm not familiar with it, so
4	it's not clear to me how it is that you
5	received it. You apparently were not
6	included in the "to" field, correct?
7	A. Right. And it's not -- it clearly
8	indicates the text is to -- it says, "Thanks
9	for this, Betty." So he didn't write it to
10	me. He sent it to me, but he didn't write
11	it to me.
12	Q. Have you seen other GMail e-mails
13	where it will indicate cc when you've
14	received such an e-mail?
15	A. I guess. I just hit the print
16	function on the GMail. I mean, you know,
17	there's a little drop-down window or --
18	actually, on the side, it says "print all"
19	and I just hit "print all."
20	Q. Did you read Exhibit 10, aside from
21	opening it, prior to June 25th, 2009?
22	A. Exhibit 10, I did not open or read
23	or even know about until after the Grossman
24	deposition. I went back, after I was asked
25	a second time about this, and kind of dug
1	around in my e-mail box and came up with
2	these two e-mails.
3	Q. And you understand why I was asking
4	that question, right? At least on my
5	computer, I can read portions of an e-mail
6	without actually opening it because there's
7	sort of a window in which I can see the
8	contents of an e-mail. Is your system set
9	up that way?
10	A. GMail is a -- I can show you on my
11	computer, in GMail, you have a line, a
12	subject line and then maybe the first two or
13	three words of a sentence.
14	Q. Without opening it?
15	A. Right. That's all. I mean, it's a
16	very limited view.
17	Q. But you don't think you even read
18	that much of Exhibit 10 without opening it
19	prior to June 25th, correct?
20	A. Right. I don't think I opened
21	Number 10 on June 25th.
22	Q. I'm not asking you now if you opened
23	it.
24	A. I mean, I discovered this after the
25	Grossman deposition, when I went back and
1	thought I should make sure that everything
2	was all right on that.
3	Q. To your knowledge, you didn't read
4	any portion of Exhibit 10 --
5	A. That's right.
6	Q. -- prior to June 25th, 2009?
7	A. That's correct. I did not read any
8	of i t.
9	Q. Do you know if Dr. Proctor has
10	produced any of his e-mails regarding this
11	subject?
12	A. I have no idea.
13	Q. What is your understanding of why
14	Matt Schultz told you this past Saturday
15	about what happened at Friday's hearing
16	relative to Dr. Proctor?
17	A. I'm sorry. Say that again.
18	Q. What is your understanding of why
19	Matt Schultz told you what happened at
20	Friday's hearing about Dr. Proctor?
21	A. I asked him. And I was just really
22	concerned for Robert as -- you know, I mean,
23	I know him. He's a nice guy. I consider
24	him a friend and a colleague. And, you
25	know, I was just curious.
1	Q. is part of the reason you asked Mr.
2	Schultz because you knew that you had not
3	disclosed Exhibits 9 and 10?
4	A. Well, you know, I did have these
5	that I did not recollect at the Barbanell
6	deposition and discovered after the Grossman
7	deposition, and I -- he did not advise me on
8	that, but I told him that I had discovered
9	these e-mails that I had not recollected and
10	that I didn't want that -- you know, I felt
11	bad about that and I wanted to set that
12	record straight because it's -- you know,
13	it's important to set that straight.
14	And I have nothing -- I didn't do
15	anything. I have no involvement with any of
16	this business going on at the university of
17	Florida in any way whatsoever, so I -- you
18	know, I'm a little ticked at being kind of
19	implicated by getting these e-mails, but
20	that's another issue and that's aside.
21	So I was -- I wanted to unburden
22	myself in that regard because when I
23	discovered that my Barbanell testimony, when
24	I found these e-mails and found the one that
25	I had forgotten about, I wanted to get that
1	out.
2	Q. Okay. So on this past Saturday,
3	August 22nd, you told Matt Schultz that you
4	had Exhibits 9 and 10, correct?
5	A. I told him that I had found a couple
6	of e-mails, and that, you know, I needed to
7	-- I mean, he didn't tell me anything to do
8	with them. I didn't really tell him what I
9	was going to do, but I did tell him that.
10	Q. The e-mails that you told Matt
11	Schultz about on August 22nd are represented
12	as Exhibits 9 and 10, correct?
13	A. Oh, yes. I'm sorry. I
14	misunderstood what you were asking me. Yes.
15	That's right. These are the two.
16	Q. And how did he respond? How did
17	Matt Schultz respond when you told him that
18	you had these e-mails that are marked
19	Exhibits 9 and 10?
20	A. He didn't really respond. I mean, I
21	just told him that, you know, I had
22	discovered these and that, you know, I
23	didn't -- I didn't want them, so to speak.
24	And I told him, if asked about it, I've got
25	to tell the truth on them so I will -- the
1	next time I'm asked, I told him, I had these
2	two e-mails.
3	Q. Did Matt Schultz tell you that you
4	should disclose them to someone voluntarily?
5	A. He said, well, tell the -- no. He
6	-- I mean, he just said, well, you always
7	have to tell the truth, and I agreed with
8	that. So that's al1.
9	You know, once you get caught -- you
10	know, once you attempt to not, you know, be
11	forthright, then that's the worst. And I've
12	always said, you know, you don't need a good
13	memory when you tell the truth.
14	Q. You testified earlier that the first
15	time you disclosed Exhibits 9 and 10 were at
16	this deposition today; isn't that correct?
17	A. That's right. You asked me about
18	them and I printed them out.
19	Q. And so that testimony you gave today
20	was not accurate, because the first time you
21	disclosed Exhibits 9 and 10 to anyone was to
22	Matt Schultz two days ago, correct?
23	A. Oh, I see what you mean, when you
24	say disclosed, well, I identified to him
25	that after searching my e-mail, after the --
1	after the Grossman deposition, that I found
2	one e-mail that I didn't even know I had,
3	and that it reminded myself of an e-mail
4	that I had forgotten about when asked in
5	Barbanel1.
6	And so -- I mean, I came into this
7	deposition, you know, with that on my mind,
8	and I was just -- you know, as soon as you
9	asked me about it, I told you about it.
10	Q. You came into the deposition wanting
11	to get Exhibits 9 and 10 off your chest, so
12	to speak?
13	A. That would be fair. Sure.
14	Q. Okay. But you didn't mention
15	Exhibits 9 or 10 until several hours into
16	this deposition, correct?
17	A. That's true. I mean, there's a lot
18	of material to go over.
19	Q. I asked you this before, but -- and
20	I'm not accusing you of anything, but
21	there's sort of more details that are coming
22	out about the conversation with Matt Schultz
23	that I didn't hear about the first time I
24	asked you.
25	So what I would really like you to
1	do, since it was only two days ago, is the
2	best you can, give me a play-by-play, who
3	called whom, you know, from the get go, who
4	said what, who responded with what, because
5	I'm really not sort of understanding how
6	these even came up.
7	So with that explanation, could you
8	start with who placed the phone call, and
9	then, as best you can recall, you know, as
10	verbatim as you can make it, how the
11	discussion --
12	A. Sure. Matt called me -- Matt and I
13	talked. I sent him a text message saying,
14	give me a call when you get a chance. He
15	called me.
16	We talked about the arrangements for
17	the deposition next week on September 1,
18	where it was going to be. They had just
19	sent me some documents relevant that I had
20	to read, things that I had some questions
21	about some aspects of preparation for the
22	deposition.
23	And then I asked him about this
24	Proctor business. I said, you know, what's
25	the status on that? And he said, well, they
1	had a hearing and they're subpoenaing
2	e-mails from Robert Proctor from the
3	University of Florida and other items. I
4	don't know all the details. But they
5	apparently have been subpoenaed.
6	And I told him that after the
7	Grossman trial that -- or the Grossman
8	deposition, I had searched my e-mail because
9	I had been asked about this. And I had
10	nothing to do with any of this, but I had
11	found one e-mail that I had never read and
12	one e-mail that I had forgotten was in
13	there, and that I was concerned that in the
14	Barbanell trial that when they asked me if I
15	had heard about this, I said, I don't know
16	anything about it. And I really didn't.
17	That e-mail rendered that incomplete. The
18	e-mail was a missing part of that.
19	You know, prior to that, when I had
20	been asked about e-mails, I mentioned that I
21	am -- I already gave you the e-mail on the
22	forwarding e-mail for Gregg Michel, for
23	example, so I have been up front about those
24	things.
25	And he said, well, just -- you know,
1	just tell the truth. He didn't tell me to
2	pop the e-mails in your hand right away, but
3	he said, you know, just set it right. Tell
4	the truth. I said, that's what I'm going to
5	do because I've looked at this and, you
6	know, I've tried to, in this endeavor,
7	always tried to be exactly on task. I've
8	made some mistakes over the years, misstated
9	when I got tenure accidentally. You all
10	like to remind me of that one. You know,
11	gotten in a weird conversation about the
12	history of saccharin in another deposition,
13	and this one.
14	And this just seemed -- you know,
15	it's -- I had no role whatsoever in any of
16	this stuff at the university of Florida,
17	none whatsoever, but I did have these two
18	e-mails, so here they are for you.
19	Q. Okay. I think you -- you sort of
20	tailed off from the purpose of the question,
21	which was to be the verbatim exchange.
22	A. We talked about the September 1
23	deposition. I said, what happened with the
24	Proctor business. I heard there was going
25	to be some hearing or something. He said,
1	they've -- they think that he may be engaged
2	in -- or the argument was that there's a
3	possibility, they want to review whether his
4	conduct was inappropriate, in terms of this
5	kind of stuff. I'm not going to make that
6	judgment, but that was the rationale for the
7	subpoena that he told me.
8	And I said, well, you know, I've --
9	after the Grossman deposition I had, I found
10	these two e-mails in my e-mail box, where I
11	was kind of poking around just to make sure
12	everything was okay. And he said, well,
13	just, you know, tell the truth. So I said,
14	that's what I always do. So that was it.
15	Q. When Mr. Schultz told you to tell
16	the truth, what did you think that meant?
17	Tell the truth where?
18	A. Well, I had a deposition today.
19	Q. In other words -- Matt Schultz isn't
20	counsel on this case, is he?
21	A. No. No. I wasn't talking to him as
22	a person in -- as a counsel on this case;
23	just it came up in a conversation, just as a
24	-- you know, as an adjunct to our main
25	purpose of the conversation, which was the
1	deposition. And, you know, I told him that
2	-- you told him when I found these, you
3	know, I -- I wanted to, you know, pass them
4	on. So --
5	Q. Matt Schultz isn't your attorney,
6	correct?
7	A. No. And I wasn't talking to him --
8	I mean, you want to know the conversation.
9	Q. Right.
10	A. And -- no.
11	MR. OGLE:
12	So that's just the answer, okay, no.
13	A. No.
14	MR. HENK:
15	Q. In other words, Matt Schultz has not
16	been providing, whether on Saturday or
17	otherwise, legal counsel to you?
18	A. No.
19	Q. You could have -- well, let me ask
20	you, who were plaintiff's counsel in the
21	Barbanell case?
22	A. A guy named Steve Hamer and John --
23	Jonathan Gdanski.
24	Q. Have you told Mr. Hamer or Mr.
25	Gdanski or anyone associated with their
1	offices about Exhibits 9 and 10?
2	A. No. I haven't had much -- you know,
3	much interaction with them except for when I
4	went there to testify.
5	Q. Why have you not told Mr. Hamer or
6	Mr. Gdanski about Exhibits 9 and 10?
7	A. I don't know. I mean, it -- yeah.
8	I went there. I testified. Mr. Hamer had a
9	broken leg during that trial. I was focused
10	on getting the trial. I wasn't really
11	thinking about it. So, no, I don't know
12	why. I just didn't -- it just didn't occur
13	to me.
14	Q. Well, why did you want to get
15	Exhibits 9 and 10 off your chest today
16	versus prior to the Barbanell trial
17	starting?
18	A. I, you know, was focused on getting
19	ready for that trial and testifying in that
20	case.
21	Q. Why didn't you tell Mr. Hamer or Mr.
22	Gdanski about Exhibits 9 and 10 after the
23	Barbanell trial?
24	A. I really haven't had any
25	communication with them on anything, so I
1	haven't had occasion to talk to them.
2	Q. Well, why did you choose not to
3	contact Mr. Hamer or Mr. Gdanski about
Page 239
4	Exhibits 9 and 10 after the Barbanell trial?
5	A. I just didn't think about it. You
6	know, from that trial, I flew to visit my
7	parents in North Carolina. Then, you know,
8	just working, you know, and out of sight,
9	out of mind. This is not my main job. Most
10	of my day is spent working with the things
11	that we see in this room at the Center For
12	Oral History.
13	Q. When were you planning on telling
14	Mr. Hamer or Mr. Gdanski about Exhibits 9
15	and 10?
16	A. I hadn't really thought about that.
17	I mean, you know, that trial was over, and
18	-- I see what you are saying, because it was
19	the original deposition in that case, but
20	that trial was over and I just wasn't
21	thinking about that.
22	Q. Do you think Mr. Hamer and Mr.
23	Gdanski would not want to know about
24	Exhibits 9 and 10?
25	MR. OGLE:
1	Form objection.
2	A. I don't know what they would -- I
3	can't answer that.
4	MR. HENK:
5	Q. Can you think of a reason why they
6	would not want to know about Exhibits 9 and
Page 240
7	10?
8	A. Why they would not want to know?
9	MR. OGLE:
10	Form objection.
11	MR. HENK:
12	Q. Right.
13	A. No, I can't.
14	Q. Do you believe that it's up to the
15	judge in the Barbanell case to figure out
16	whether there's significance associated with
17	the fact that you gave inaccurate deposition
18	testimony in Barbanell?
19	MR. OGLE:
20	Object to the form.
21	A. Well, I imagine you are going to
22	bring it to him. That's an interesting
23	point. I hadn't thought of it that way.
24	I guess this is part of -- you know,
25	I think of things about me, trying to do the
1	best I can and being as forthright, it's
2	always -- it's a different way of looking at
3	it. You guys are -- you work by the case,
4	you are on the case. You work case by case.
5	I don't really think of it that way.
6	You know, which partly explains why
7	when you asked me, you know, are you
8	interested in who's going to win, I said,
9	well, you know, no, because I don't really
Page 241
10	think of it that way.
11	But, no, I didn't think to inform
12	them. I was thinking more about my own self
13	being as forthright as possible.
14	Q. Do you think it should be up to you
15	to decide whether the inaccurate testimony
16	is of significance for anything to happen
17	relative to it?
18	A. Well, from a legal standpoint?
19	Q. Yes.
20	A. No.
21	Q. it's up to the judge to decide,
22	correct?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. The judge can't decide unless he
25	knows about it, correct?
1	A. Right. That's a good point.
2	Q. And are you aware that there are
3	deadlines to raise issues with judges before
4	a judgment becomes final?
5	A. No. I wasn't aware of that.
6	Q. Okay.
7	A. I mean, I don't know that much about
8	the legal process.
9	Q. You figured that you could raise an
10	issue with respect to a judgment, for
11	example, years after it happened or--
12	A. I never thought about that. I mean,
Page 242
13	that's not an issue that I think about. I
14	mean, you know, from my perspective,
15	litigation seems to be something that goes
16	on forever, and, you know, I'm not being
17	flippant, but that's just not an issue I
18	never, ever considered.
19	Q. Other than the people sitting in the
20	room today and Matt Schultz, have you told
21	anyone else that you received Exhibits 9 and
22	10?
23	A. No. I informed these guys today or
24	-- I mean, when it came out in the trial --
25	I mean, in the questioning, so that's people
1	in this room. No, nobody else.
2	Q. Why did you not inform Mr. Garrity
3	about Exhibits 9 and 10 after you gave your
4	testimony in the Barbanell case?
5	MR. OGLE:
6	Form objection.
7	A. That never occurred to me. I mean,
8	I'm not in the habit of talking to, you
9	know, attorneys, you know, the defense
10	attorneys.
11	MR. HENK:
12	Q. You recall that it was Jenny Brown
13	that deposed you in the Barbanell case?
14	A. That's right. But there were other
15	people, too. There was a woman on the
Page 243
16	telephone who actually asked me about the
17	e-mails, this stuff.
18	Q. Jenny Brown, though, is the primary
19	counsel that examined you at your deposition
20	in the Barbanell case?
21	A. That's right.
22	Q. Did you inform Ms. Brown at any
23	point in time about Exhibits 9 and 10?
24	A. No.
25	Q. And why not?
1	A. For the same reason I didn't inform
2	Mr. Garrity. I just didn't -- didn't think
3	about them, am not in the habit of calling
4	any defense attorneys.
5	Q. Not in the habit of disclosing that
6	you realized you gave inaccurate testimony
7	or not in the habit for any reason?
8	A. Oh, no. It just never occurred to
9	me to contact them. That never crossed my
10	mi nd.
11	Q. Why did you want to get Exhibits 9
12	and 10 off your chest today?
13	A. Well, you know, I found them in my
14	e-mail box and just wanted to set the record
15	straight. And, again, just so that you are
16	clear, these were just simply e-mails that
17	were sent to me, so the mistake that I made
18	in Barbanell was to not recollect that I had
Page 244
19	gotten an e-mail, but no action whatsoever
20	on my part in anything to do with any of
21	these e-mails. I've not done any of the
22	things described in these e-mails.
23	Q. Do you have any explanation at all
24	for why you decided to disclose Exhibits 9
25	and 10 today versus any other day?
1	A. I just wanted to disgorge them, to
2	just get them off my chest.
3	Q. is it just a coincidence that you
4	disclosed Exhibits 9 and 10 today, two days
5	after you learned that a judge on Friday had
6	ordered or allowed e-mails to be subpoenaed
7	from Dr. Proctor? Is that just a
8	coincidence?
9	A. It's certainly -- it got me to think
10	about this again and reminded me that I had
11	these in here, if they're going to be
12	subpoenaed, you know, I might as well get
13	the ones out that I had. Which, you know,
14	were not sent to the University of Florida.
15	They were sent to me.
16	Q. I don't want to have any sort of
17	"gotcha" here because you have a stamp that
18	would indicate for your printing and so
19	forth, but do you know whether the
20	substantive content of Exhibits 9 and 10,
21	including the "to" field of Exhibits 9 and
Page 245
22	10 was produced by -- in response to the
23	subpoena?
24	A. Oh, I have no idea. I don't know
25	what's been produced or whatever.
1	You know, my assumption has been --
2	and I've always operated under the
3	assumption that e-mails are not private, you
4	know, that there's -- particularly at a
5	state university, there's nothing private
6	about any of our e-mails. You know, only
7	put things you feel comfortable with putting
8	on the busiest street corner in town in an
9	e-mail. That's always been my personal, you
10	know, mode of operation.
11	Q. Are you okay with attorneys
12	disclosing you as being an expert witness
13	prior to contacting you about disclosing
14	you?
15	A. Well, I've been disclosed on a lot
16	of cases, and this has come up before.
17	Before I'm going to do any work on anything
18	and before I'll agree to sit for a
19	deposition and actually work on a case,
20	that's when attorneys have contacted me.
21	I learned -- in fact, I learned in a
22	deposition, back in the fall, that
23	apparently, I had been listed on a whole
24	bunch of cases. And that might have been --
Page 246
25	I was unaware of that at the time, where
1	they had just kind of listed my name as a
2	potential expert. That came up in my
3	Sherman Hess deposition. And you might
4	recall -- well, you may not have read that,
5	but I was unaware that I had been disclosed
6	in a bunch of cases. But what I was aware
7	of that I had, at that point in time, dealt
8	with a number of attorneys who had asked me
9	to actually review documents and do some
10	work.
11	Q. Let me try again. I've forgotten
12	now the exact wording of my question. But
13	what I was getting at is, are you okay with
14	the practice of plaintiff's counsel
15	disclosing you as an expert before they've
16	even contacted you?
17	A. Well, I wasn't okay with it at the
18	time, and I'm still not okay with it, but
19	now, I don't think I'm -- I've talked with
20	the people that are disclosing me on cases,
21	so I feel comfortable that I'm in
22	communication with the people that are
23	interested in retaining me as an expert in
24	their cases.
25	Q. Is part of the reason you are sort
1	of more okay with it now because you believe
2	you basically have generic opinions to give?
3	is that fai r to say?
4	A. Well, I mean, you know, I've never
5	been a biographer of the plaintiff, and
6	that's something I've been consistent, I
7	think in every case I've ever testified in.
8	I know in every case I've ever testified in.
9	And I'm going to continue to be consistent
10	with that.
11	That quality of my opinions has not
12	changed over time. You know what I mean?
13	Do you follow me on that?
14	Q. Okay. Are you familiar with the
15	term "cancer stick"?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And when you've done research, when
18	is the first time, earliest point in time
19	you saw reference to that term?
20	A. Late '50s.
21	Q. And what is the publication, if you
22	recall, in which you saw that term used?
23	A. There's a good reference book called
24	the "Random House Dictionary of American
25	Slang." And what's good about that is they
1	list the -- they'll have a little -- not a
2	little, but an extended entry on each of
3	their slang terms, and the cancer stick
4	reference is from the late '50s. They cite
5	a couple of publications, those I don't have
6	in recollection, but you could look that up.
7	Q. And are you familiar with the term
8	"coffin nail"?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. In doing your research over the
11	years, what is the earliest reference, in
12	terms of point in time, you saw the term
13	"coffin nail" used?
14	A. Well, if you go to the Oxford
15	English Dictionary, the term "coffin nail"
16	goes back really into the -- I think it's
17	John Dunn, the poetry of Dunn, you can see
18	the term used very early.
19	But I think what you are asking me
20	about is the term "coffin nail" in relation
21	to a cigarette, and that is almost
22	completely contemporaneous with the
23	introduction of the machine-made cigarette
24	in the 1880s, according to my research.
25	Q. I just want to make sure I'm clear
1	on the time you've spent on these two cases.
2	I know that you said that you spent an
3	hour-and-a-half to review the Koballa
4	deposition, correct?
5	A. That's about right, yes.
6	Q. And an hour to review the Lewis
7	deposition, correct?
8	A. That's right.
9	Q. And I just want to be clear, that is
10	the total time that you've spent on the two
11	cases, right?
12	A. Yes. it's about -- it's about
13	two-and-a-half to three hours.
14	Q. Okay. Well --
15	A. Or two-and-a-half hours.
16	Two-and-a-half hours. Sorry.
17	Q. So, in other words, you didn't spend
18	time on top of having reviewed the
19	depositions you already testified about in
20	Koballa and Lewis; the only time you spent
21	on those two cases is reviewing the
22	depositions, correct?
23	A. That's right, yes. I haven't done
24	anything else for this case.
25	Q. On Koballa, I just want to make sure
1	I'm clear, do you intend to use any Philip
2	Morris advertisements, in terms of what
3	you've called your presentation?
4	A. Well, I was asked that this morning,
5	and -- yes. I'll probably use some Philip
6	Morris ads. Ms. Koballa did not report
7	smoking the Philip Morris brand of
8	cigarette, but my position is that the
9	advertising shapes expectations about the
10	general category of the cigarette, informs
11	the public how to use the cigarette.
12	So, for example, the Do You inhale
13	campaign from Philip Morris, which would be,
14	you know, '30s and the 1940s, you know,
15	that's -- you know, one of the points about
16	that, at least as a historian, is that, you
17	know, the ad is telling you, you know, the
18	point of the cigarette is that it's designed
19	to be inhaled. So that's how I would use
20	it.
21	Q. Is it your view that but for such an
22	ad, people didn't realize that the point of
23	the cigarette was to inhale?
24	A. No. No. I mean, this is not --
25	you'd think of it as a reinforcer as opposed
1	to -- it's not providing new knowledge, if
2	that's what you are asking.
3	Q. Okay. It's sort of, in your view,
4	in case they forgot, then they would see the
5	ad and realize, oh, yes, I'm supposed to
6	inhale --
7	MR. OGLE:
8	Form objection.
9	MR. HENK:
10	Q. -- the cigarette?
11	A. I would put it this way -- and maybe
12	this is a distinction that is too fine, but
13	I don't think it is. I would say that it
14	helped shape a kind of common cultural
15	expectation that the point of the cigarette
16	is to inhale. Because, you know, one could
17	smoke a cigarette without inhaling. People
18	smoke cigars that way sometimes. And it's
19	-- it's a reinforcer and helping shape a
20	kind of cultural expectation about how to
21	use the cigarette.
22	Yes. People are inhaling
23	cigarettes. Philip Morris did not invent
24	the idea, when it put out those ads, and I
25	would never say it so simplistically like
1	that, because that's not true. But it's
2	helping to kind of reinforce how to use the
3	product, much the same way as when they show
4	people in mixed gender situations how to use
5	the product. Or as when someone watches a
6	movie from the time period and they see
7	people in social situations using the
8	cigarette, all of them have this similar
9	function of reinforcing to the public, be it
10	movie or advertising, you know, what is
11	acceptable behavior and etiquette and usage
12	of the cigarette.
13	Q. Is it your understanding that Ms.
14	Koballa did not use a Philip Morris product
15	until 1994?
16	A. Right, with the Basic. I believe
17	she was smoking the Basic cigarette late in
18	her smoking career. That's my
19	understanding.
20	Q. But, nonetheless, you anticipate
21	using ads with respect to Philip Morris
22	products from the 1930s?
23	A. Yes. Philip Morris and Camel and
24	all the major brands, just to show the kind
25	of characterization of the cigarette, how it
1	appeared in the media, you know, the idea
2	that the advertising -- it does transmit
3	information about the brand. I mean, that's
4	-- and the manufacturer is hoping that
5	people will buy that brand.
6	But the advertising also serves the
7	function of transmitting information about
8	the category, the consumer product category
9	of the cigarette, as well. So in that
10	regard, it's relevant for my opinions and my
11	discussion.
12	Q. Do you intend to tailor your
13	presentation to the actual brands that were
14	used, as far as you understand it?
15	A. You know, I haven't gotten that far
16	in thinking about what I may or may not do.
17	I mean, you know, she began smoking Lucky
18	Strike, and Lucky Strike is one of the most
19	heavily marketed brands during that period.
20	So there's certainly plenty of Lucky Strike
21	advertisements.
22	If you were just to base it on what
23	was the most prevalent advertisement, you
24	would have Lucky Strike and Camel in there
25	as a kind of first and second.
1	Q. Well, let me ask this -- and I don't
2	want you to misunderstand, when I say
3	"Philip Morris," I'm not being specific to
4	the Philip Morris brand. I'm talking about
5	any brands that would have been manufactured
6	by Philip Morris USA or whatever it was
7	called at the time.
8	Do you intend to use any, you know,
9	visual display, whether it be an
10	advertisement, a photo of a --
11	representation of a billboard, anything of
12	that nature, of an advertisement with
13	respect to a product, a Philip Morris
14	product that we haven't seen to date in the
15	progeny cases this year?
16	A. You mean new advertisements that you
17	haven't seen?
18	Q. In other words, that we haven't seen
19	from you in your testimony in the progeny
20	cases this year. Do you have some new ones
21	in mind that you plan to use?
22	A. No. I've got my favorites. I like
23	to stick with those.
24	To be honest with you, as they get
25	closer to the trial, my recommendation will
1	be that there were some very attractive
2	displays put together by one of the computer
3	people, the trial management guys, you know,
4	the paralegal that does the video, and that
5	those were very good. We used those in
6	Sherman and Hess. I personally think those
7	were wel1-designed and are a good
8	description of the ads that I like to use.
9	So my preference is to stick with those
10	exact exhibits, you know, just on the ease
11	of why reinvent the wheel.
12	Q. And so the answer is, to Koballa and
13	Lewis, is you don't have any new
14	advertisements in mind as to Philip Morris
15	products that you plan to utilize, correct?
16	A. That's correct, yes.
17	Q. And, of course, by "new," I meant
18	that we have not seen to date in your
19	testimony in the progeny cases this year.
20	A. Right. No. I don't have anything.
21	I mean, I have plenty to draw from.
22	Q. You didn't know anything about the
23	Koballa or Lewis cases before a week ago,
24	did you?
25	A. Not anything substantive about the
1	smokers. I mean, I knew that they were on
2	my schedule, but nothing substantive.
3	Q. You said you don't charge for
4	primary source research; is that correct?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. And I just want to make sure it's
7	clear because you brought it up in the
8	context of Newspaperarchives.com, right?
9	A. Yes. That's correct. I'm sorry. I
10	was nodding. Yes. That's correct.
11	Q. Do you consider searches you do on
12	Newspaperarchives.com to be primary source
13	research?
14	A. Yes. Because I'm -- the result of
15	that are newspapers, which are a primary
16	source, yes. That would be a primary source
17	research.
18	Q. And do you know the methodology that
19	Newspaperarchives.com used to compile what
20	is on that database?
21	A. You mean, why they have the
22	newspapers that they do as opposed to not
23	having other papers? Yes. I know that
24	methodology.
25	Q. And what is it?
1	A. what was in the warehouse that they
2	could digitize without having to, you know,
3	get permission.
4	The company grows out some of the
5	old Bell & Howell Microphone Corporation,
6	one of these companies that would microfilm
7	newspapers for archives all over the
8	country. You know, the State of Tennessee
9	has a project, and they gather all the small
10	town newspapers and other papers, they send
11	it off to them and they are set up to take
12	the picture. They keep a copy, a
13	preservation copy. Those are the ones that
14	they digitized and put on Newspaperarchive.
15	So, in essence, it's a convenience
16	methodology, just what they happen to have.
17	Q. Would that be similar to your view
18	of Senior Scholastic, how they conducted
19	that poll?
20	A. Well, you are mixing apples and
21	oranges, here.
22	Q. Well, I'm just asking a question.
23	A. Sure. No. It wouldn't be similar.
24	Q. Okay. How do you know what
25	methodology Newspaperarchives.com used to
1	compile their database?
2	A. Well, I've read about the company.
3	I mean, the company was covered in the
4	press, well, the professional press. I
5	mean, you know, they -- there's no secret to
6	this, it's been discussed. And in the
7	course of learning about the service, which
8	I think only came on line a couple of years
9	ago, I read about it, and I said, oh, yes,
10	the old Bell & Howell company.
11	And, you know, it's -- you should
12	think of them as a library. The same reason
13	why the library has books, they've got these
14	-- I mean, it's happenstance, what they
15	have, in a sense. Any archive is like that.
16	Archives get stuff because people happen to
17	donate it or put it there, and that's why
18	you have to look at lots of different
19	archives, and there's no one source that
20	gives a complete answer.
21	it's different than the attempt to
22	draw a systematic sample of a quantitative
23	population. So that was the apples and
24	oranges comment.
25	Q. Well, let me try and speed up where
1	I'm going on this because I think the truth
2	is -- not the truth, but the reality is, you
3	don't actually know the methodology for
Page 258
4	sure. Maybe you've read about it, but you
5	don't know the actual methodology, so let me
6	ask you --
7	MR. OGLE:
8	Form objection, already.
9	MR. HENK:
10	Well, I'm asking a new question now.
11	That was just trying to speed this up.
12	Q. From personal knowledge, do you know
13	what methodology Newspaperarchives.com used
14	to compile their database?
15	A. Well, you mean in terms of selecting
16	which newspapers to include in their
17	archives?
18	Q. Correct.
19	A. it's not really a methodology, it's
20	not methodological. It's simply what they
21	have. I mean, there is no methodology in
22	that regard. That's the best way to
23	characterize it.
24	Q. Let me ask a follow-up question. Do
25	you know how they decided which newspapers
1	to pick? I mean, you are going to say,
2	well, what was in their warehouse. But let
3	me ask you this: How did
4	Newspaperarchives.com pick what was in this
5	warehouse you are talking about?
6	A. Within the inventory? My
Page 259
7	understanding is that within what they had
8	in their preservation copies, their
9	permanent copies, those that they could
10	digitize without having any intellectual
11	property concerns and to which they either
12	had clear ownership or to which a copyright
13	did not apply in any of the other various
14	concerns.
15	To put it another way, those
16	newspapers to which they had the right to
17	transform into a digital format and then
18	therefore disseminate over the web because,
19	of course, you can't do that with any
20	newspaper.
21	Q. Okay. So Newspaperarchives.com does
22	not have within its database every issue of
23	every small town newspaper; is that correct?
24	A. Oh, no. No. And I'm sorry if I led
25	you to believe that. No, not at all. No,
1	it does not.
2	Q. And do you know how they chose
3	between one paper versus another paper?
4	A. Just what I explained to you.
5	Q. Do you know how they chose between
6	-- how they chose what is a small town
7	newspaper?
8	A. Oh, they don't characterize papers
9	along those lines. That was my
Page 260
10	characterization. They, in no way -- in no
11	way is the Newspaperarchive.com set of
12	newspapers a systematic representative
13	sample of all newspapers in America. I
14	think -- we've been talking past each other
15	and I think we got to the heart of it.
16	Q. That's the answer I was looking for.
17	A. Yes. I agree with you on that one.
18	Q. Okay. When you say that
19	advertisements shaped the expectations of
20	the public, how do you know whether that
21	actually occurred because of the
22	advertisements?
23	A. Well, right. It's a case where, you
24	know, in historical research, I mean, you
25	look at the ad, you look at the prevalence
1	of the type of ad, and you look at the
2	behavior of the public. And you, you know,
3	kind of look for connections.
4	It's not a one-to-one. And I would
5	never get up there and say, this one
6	particular ad caused this one particular
7	action in either an individual or even a
8	group of individuals.
9	what they are -- the ads that I show
10	are representative of the kind of
11	information that appeared frequently in the
12	case of print media, print media or in
Page 261
13	electronic media, if it was a television
14	commercial. And it's my professional
15	judgment that these helped shape, you know,
16	this American cigarette culture.
17	And examples of this, in support of
18	this would be the way that advertising
19	slogans for cigarettes -- and this is true
20	of other products, as well, but advertising
21	for cigarettes became part of the popular
22	culture, LSMFT, which became kind of a part
23	of the public culture when that campaign was
24	added. Or Winston Tastes Good, snapping my
25	fingers, Like a Cigarette Should, that also
1	became part of the culture, and Marlboro
2	Man, drawing upon these iconic images.
3	Q. Are there any polls that you are
4	aware of that looked at any certain type of
5	advertisement? Not a particular
6	advertisement, a single advertisement, but
7	whatever you might define as a category of
8	advertisements, and then looked at how that
9	category of advertisements affected the
10	expectations of the public?
11	A. I haven't seen that. And that may
12	exist, but I haven't come across it.
13	Q. You testified earlier today that
14	event memory can be highly fallible,
15	correct?
16	A. Can we take a short break?
17	Q. Sure. Can you just answer this one
18	question?
19	THE WITNESS:
20	It's my daughter.
21	VIDEO REPORTER:
22	We're going off the record. The
23	time is 6:17.
24	(Off the record.)
25	MR. HENK:
1	Q. Event memory is highly fallible,
2	correct?
3	VIDEO REPORTER:
4	Back on the record, beginning of
5	Tape 5, 6:26. Go ahead.
6	MR. HENK:
7	Q. Event memory is highly fallible,
8	correct?
9	A. That's true.
10	Q. And there is no record to go check
11	on someone's smoking details, correct, no
12	official record?
13	A. That's right. I guess you would
14	rely on eyewitness and personal
15	recollection.
16	Q. You said that it's important to you
17	to know -- to locate the smoker in terms of
18	time and place, correct?
19	A. That's right.
20	Q. And why is that important?
21	A. Well, simply to place the smoker in
22	their generation, in their cohort. I mean,
23	it matters if someone began smoking, say, in
24	the 1930s, you know, when the cigarette
25	prevalence was rising sharply upward, or the
1	1940s, during World War II, or, you know,
2	the 1960s, for example.
3	The information discussed in the
4	press and the media is different at all
5	those different periods of time. There's
6	different smoking products. There's
7	different forms of communication, TV in the
8	latter period, no TV in the earlier period.
9	So history is different and society is
10	different. So you want to avoid that kind
11	of presentistic bias, by assuming that the
12	way things are now is the way they've always
13	been. So you want to locate that person in
14	their historical context, proper historical
15	context.
16	Q. How would your opinions vary if the
17	smoker had started smoking in 1930 versus
18	1960?
19	A. Well, you know, there's different
20	information available, for example. The
21	person beginning smoking in 1930, that age
Page 264
22	cohort, and whether they were male or female
23	wouldn't matter, in this case, let's deal
24	with women, since these are two women.
25	That's at the beginning of the increase in
1	smoking. It's right when women are really
2	moving towards the cigarette, late '20s,
3	'30s. 1960, it's a very different
4	environment, lots of women do smoke already.
5	So that's -- you have to respect chronology
6	and time.
7	Q. Well, I understand how your
8	presentation might be different, but how
9	would your opinions be different?
10	A. Oh, okay. Right. I mean, I guess,
11	in a way, my opinions aren't different
12	because my -- you know, my opinions are, you
13	know, for example, in terms of so-called
14	common knowledge or public understanding,
15	what did the public know at certain periods
16	of historical time. And, you know, they
17	knew less at the beginning of this and they
18	knew more, increasingly more as time went
19	on. And I've talked about that. So that's
20	where the time factor comes in.
21	So, yes, my opinion doesn't change.
22	It's just where I put that person on the
23	continuum of the period that I discuss.
24	Q. What is your definition of "common
Page 265
1	A. Which I discuss in my article. I
2	use the way it's discussed in social
3	sciences. Common knowledge is a mutually
4	acknowledged shared state of knowing that
5	something is -- knowing about something and
6	knowing that it's true or believing that
7	it's true.
8	Q. Okay. "Common knowledge" is an
9	accepted term, correct?
10	A. Yes. in the social sciences, yes.
11	You see it in gained theory and philosophy.
12	it has a technical definition, which I
13	discuss in that article.
14	Q. You said you did a review of the
15	Senior Scholastic issues that you had here
16	at the school, correct?
17	A. Yes. We have the full run, but I
18	started in the mid '50s and went through the
19	mid '60s.
20	Q. And you said that when you reviewed
21	them, you learned what you needed to know,
22	correct?
23	A. Yes. I didn't have to copy
24	everything. That's true.
25	Q. And what is it that you needed to
1	know?
2	A. I was just trying to get a sense as
3	kind of the frequency of articles on smoking
4	and health and their content.
5	Q. And what is the sense that you got?
6	A. Some discussion in the 1950s. Not
7	as much as I thought I would find, but much
8	more frequent discussion in the '60s and
9	especially after the Surgeon General's
10	Report was released.
11	Q. Why did you think you would find
12	more in the 1950s?
13	A. Well, it was a big story. The
14	health scare was a big story in the 1950s.
15	I mean, it's an important -- you know, it's
16	one of many important stories, but it is an
17	important story.
18	Just in my newspaper files for the
19	1950s, there's a large number of articles
20	from, just say, The New York Times, dealing
21	with the medical issues of smoking and
22	health.
23	Q. If a plaintiff were to say that they
24	didn't realize that there were dangers
25	associated with cigarette smoking until
1	1996, would you find that credible?
2	A. Yes. I don't have a problem -- yes.
3	I mean, I've had -- I've had people tell me,
4	in 2007, that tobacco, "I've smoked all my
5	life and it hasn't hurt me." That's
6	personal experience.
7	But, you know, to give you kind of a
8	historical research method, in the letters
9	that people write to the manufacturers, R.J.
10	Reynolds, in particular, has a really good
11	set of consumer letters that people write,
12	you find very frequently in the 1970s and
13	the 1980s, at least -- I have not done the
14	1990s for this particular question -- that
15	lots of people write in and say, you know, I
16	don't beli eve i t.
17	Now, that's reflected in the survey
18	data. It's not until really the late 1980s
19	that you get really high, high, a super high
20	response rate on the link between cigarettes
21	and cancer, that is, where it reaches the 90
22	percent and above rate on surveys. So at
23	least in the '70s and the '80s, you do find
24	people like that.
25	Q. Well, let me ask you a little bit
1	differently, what if someone were to
2	testify that they did not hear that
3	cigarette smoking had dangers associated
4	with it until 1996, would you find that
5	credible?
6	A. Well, it was -- you know, generally,
7	I mean, I -8	MR. OGLE:
9	I am going to object to that form.
10	I'm sorry to interrupt you. I'm going to
11	object to that form.
12	A. My testimony has been that there are
13	lots of people who may be aware of the
14	accusation that cigarettes are dangerous,
15	but for one reason or another, don't believe
16	that accusation. And that even into the
17	1980s, you can find, you know, significant
18	-- you know, significant numbers of people
19	in that category, at least based on polling
20	data or kind of hard survey data.
21	So the story was certainly covered.
22	I mean, lots of people talked about it but
23	not everybody believed it and that's been my
24	testimony, and that's how I see it as a
25	historian.
1	You know, for a particular
2	individual, the jury is going to have to
3	decide how credible that particular
4	individual is. I'm not going to make a
5	statement one way or the other on the
6	credibility of a particular piece of
7	plaintiff's testimony.
8	Q. Well, I appreciate that but I am
9	going to have to have you answer my
10	question. And my question didn't ask
11	anything about beliefs, it asked about
12	whether someone had heard, so let me try it
13	agai n.
14	if a plaintiff were to testify that
15	they had not heard that cigarette smoking
16	was dangerous until 1996, would you find
17	that to be credible testimony?
18	MR. OGLE:
19	Form objection.
20	A. Well, I think, you know, the
21	accusation, there was a high level of
22	awareness of the accusation, so that person
23	would be in a small category, for sure. I
24	think most people had heard at least the
25	accusation that cigarettes were dangerous.
1	They may not have believed it, but I think
2	that was true, by the 1990s, most people had
3	heard this. So that's how I would respond
4	to that, that most people had heard.
5	Q. So you would find it to be credible
6	testimony?
7	A. I can't say -8	MR. OGLE:
9	Form objection.
10	A. I can't say whether -- I don't have
11	a lot of, you know, evidence to work off of
12	for any particular individual. Just as I'm
13	not going to say that somebody should or
14	shouldn't have known something at a certain
15	-- or didn't know something at a certain
16	period of time, I'm not going to testify
17	that they should have known something that
18	they may have not known.
19	All I can tell you is that these are
20	the patterns in the United States at that
21	time. You see, that door is -- that knife
22	cuts both ways and it's essentially the same
23	principle that I'm holding to. So I can't
24	say.
25	Q. Did you ever smoke cigarettes?
1	A. Not regularly. I tried them in
2	junior high school.
3	Q. How old were you when you tried
4	smoking cigarettes?
5	A. I thought I was in 8th grade. 13,
6	14.
7	Q. And I hate to ask, but what year was
8	that?
9	A. Oh, I was born in 1963, so about
10	1976, 1977.
11	Q. And why did you try smoking
12	cigarettes?
13	A. Well, it was cool. My dad smoked.
14	My mom smoked. So a friend of mine had some
15	cigarettes, so we went in the back and --
16	backyard and smoked them.
17	Q. what brand of cigarettes was it?
18	A. I don't remember. I mean, I don't
19	remember. I didn't like it. And so I never
20	really did it more than a couple of times,
21	so I never developed beyond that. But I
22	don't remember the brand. My dad smoked
23	Winstons. I do remember that. But I know
24	that we didn't get them from him. He would
25	have known if I had taken his cigarettes. I
1	wasn't going to do that.
2	Q. At the time you tried your first
3	cigarette, did you believe that smoking
4	cigarettes had adverse health consequences?
5	A. No. I mean, I was just 13 or 14. I
6	was in 8th grade, and I didn't -- I didn't
7	really think about that at all, no.
8	Q. when you compare people of that age
9	group with, for example, adults, have you
10	ever done that, in terms of perception of
11	risks? Have you ever seen any data on that?
12	A. There's some risk perception data.
13	Scusi has done some research on that, which
14	I've looked at. There's another
15	psychologist that's done some work on that
16	whose name escapes me. You know, I've not
17	incorporated that into my professional
18	opinions, it hasn't suited the historical
19	method that I've employed.
20	Q. At the time you smoked your first
21	cigarette, you weren't thinking about
22	whether there were health consequences,
23	correct?
24	A. No. No, I wasn't.
25	Q. what if you had been asked
1	immediately before you lit that first
2	cigarette, do you think cigarette smoking
3	can cause disease, how would you have
4	answered that question?
5	A. Probably, I don't know.
6	Q. Really?
7	A. Yes. I mean, a lot -- I grew up in
8	a place where a lot of people smoked, it
9	was a pretty heavy smoking area. It's kind
10	of a miracle I didn't become a smoker.
11	Q. well, what does the fact that people
12	smoked have to do with whether or not, if
13	asked, you would say that cigarette smoking
14	could cause disease?
15	A. Oh, because, you know, if everyone
16	else did it, it must not be that harmful.
17	You get my -- when I was a kid, you get my
18	big Greek family around the table, and it
19	was just a -- Thanksgiving was at our house.
20	My mom had the big table, and it was just --
21	everybody -- just about everybody smoked.
22	Q. Do you believe today that if a lot
23	of people do something, it must not be
24	harmful?
25	A. No. That's the old parental
1	argument. No. But just as a practical
2	matter, in terms of understanding social
3	phenomena, I've testified that, you know,
4	one of the ways you measure what people know
5	is what they do.
6	And, you know, I think in the 1970s,
7	we were still very much in a period where
8	you could smoke anywhere and everywhere in
9	the thrall of a kind of cigarette culture,
10	which is very different today. So --
11	But, you know, I don't remember, you
12	know, thinking about it. I didn't like
13	smoking the cigarette. That's for sure.
14	And I didn't pursue that activity and never
15	became a smoker.
16	Q. Right. Again, and I suspect you
17	didn't think about it, as a lot of kids that
18	age wouldn't think about it, especially if
19	they're only smoking a few of them. But
20	that's not really what I'm asking you. I'm
21	asking you whether you believed at that
22	point in time, had you been asked, that
23	smoking cigarettes could cause disease.
24	A. No. I don't think I understood that
25	when I was in 8th grade. I really didn't.
1	Q. Had you heard anything about that
2	subject in school?
3	A. Not that I can recall. I don't
4	recall any anti tobacco education from my
5	youth. I certainly didn't have any in high
6	school in North Carolina.
7	Q. Had you ever seen a warning label on
8	a package of cigarettes?
9	A. Well, if I knew -- yes. That was on
10	there, so I must have seen that. Right.
11	Yes. I would have seen that.
12	Q. Did you not believe what the Surgeon
13	General was telling you?
14	A. I just didn't even think about it,
15	you know. I just never thought about it
16	when I was in 8th grade.
17	Q. But if you had seen the warning
18	label, what did the warning label say as of
19	the time you had your first cigarette?
20	A. That would have been the second --
21	you know, the second iteration, so the
22	warning, "The Surgeon General has determined
23	smoking is hazardous to your health."
24	Q. Is hazardous to your health,
25	correct?
1	A. Yes. That's what I meant to say.
2	Q. Oh, you did. I was just sort of
3	emphasizing.
4	A. Oh, okay. Yes. Yes. it is
5	hazardous to your health.
6	Q. So you believed, though, as of the
7	time you had your first cigarette, despite
8	that warning label, your belief, if asked,
9	would have been different from what it said
10	on the warning label? You would have
11	believed, no, I don't think it's hazardous?
12	A. I think so, yes, when I was in 8th
13	grade.
14	Q. Why would you have disagreed with
15	what the Surgeon General was telling you?
16	A. Who was he? When I was in 8th
17	grade, who was he? You know, that's my own
18	personal response, who's he? You know,
19	everybody that I was related to, whom I
20	loved, smoked cigarettes, uncles, my dad, my
21	mom, you know, more distant relatives, my
22	neighbors. Everybody smoked. I mean, there
23	were ashtrays all over the place.
24	Q. Did you tell your parents that you
25	had smoked your first cigarette?
1	A. No. But years later, my dad
2	mentioned to me, yeah, I remember when I
3	used to watch you go off in the backyard and
4	smoke your cigarettes. And we thought we
5	were hidden. But --
6	Q. You went to where I was going. You
7	hid your first cigarettes, the fact that you
8	had smoked them from your parents, correct?
9	A. That's right. We -- not very well.
10	We kind of went in the backyard. My parents
11	had a small tool shed, which we would hang
12	out in, that was kind of under the deck, we
13	would sit in there and try our cigarettes.
14	Q. And why did you hide it from them?
15	A. Well, we tried to be a little
16	rebellious. I mean, there was a kind of
17	adult cache' to it. it was kind of cool and
18	hip, and if you did it with your parents,
19	that was not very cool and hip. That's why.
20	Q. Okay. So you didn't hide it from
21	them because you thought they would
22	disapprove?
23	A. No. They smoked. I mean, they were
24	-- they both smoked at that time.
25	Q. So your parents would have approved
1	of you smoking cigarettes when you were in
2	the 8th grade?
3	A. I don't know if they would have
Page 277
4	approved. They would have been on thin ice
5	disapproving, you know. You smoke. You are
6	going to tell me not to? So that's a
7	difficult position to be in when you are an
8	8th grader looking at the parents.
9	Q. Your parents had never taken the do
10	as I say, not as I do approach?
11	A. No. No.
12	Q. Really?
13	A. They were more the go out and make
14	your own mistakes. So -- but I didn't -- I
15	didn't persist in that, and so I was -- it
16	was a brief encounter for me, and --
17	Q. Do you think your parents would have
18	approved of you drinking alcohol as an 8th
19	grader?
20	A. No.
21	Q. Why not?
22	A. Because when I was in 8th grade and
23	we -- on a spring -- or winter break and we
24	decided to go into my neighbor's liquor
25	cabinet and do that in the middle of the
1	day, I got in big trouble.
2	Q. What did they tell you?
3	A. Well, all I remember was -- and this
4	is real personal biography that's kind of
5	funny. You remember this? I'm sitting up
6	there in my bedroom, not feeling well, and
Page 278
7	my mother said, "Michael, do something."
8	And my father said, "Well, he's suffering
9	enough as it is."
10	MR. OGLE:
11	You know, I love hearing all this
12	stuff, and it's real interesting, but it's a
13	quarter to 7:00, here quarter until 8:00 on
14	the east coast, it seems that you are
15	getting way far field of what would be
16	appropriate.
17	MR. HENK:
18	I'm almost finished, it's just a
19	few more questions.
20	Q. Were your parents not drinkers of
21	alcohol at the time they found you drinking
22	alcohol?
23	A. They were, but here's the critical
24	differences. Drinking in excess, which is
25	what I had done in my boisterous 8th grade
1	self, was different than having cocktails,
2	like my parents would want to do.
3	Q. And so your parents would have been
4	okay with you having cocktails on a
5	semi-regular basis as an 8th grader?
6	A. No. I don't think so. I think that
7	was something that when I turned 18.
8	Q. Then why is it, do you think, they
9	would make a distinction between cigarettes
Page 279
10	and alcohol?
11	A. well, as a practical matter, I mean,
12	you are asking me a lot of personal
13	questions, and I'm -- I had a fairly wild
14	youth, and I did pretty much what I was
15	going to do, particularly in high school,
16	and there wasn't much my parents were going
17	to do to curtail that.
18	So as a practical matter, on the
19	alcohol thing, what they said didn't really
20	have much of an effect on me. I did what I
21	was going to do.
22	MR. HENK:
23	Well, as an intriguing an answer as
24	that was, I'm going to pass you anyway and
25	not ask you about your wild youth.
1	EXAMINATION
2	BY MS. LAWSON:
3	Q. I have a few questions for you about
4	the two e-mails that you produced to us.
5	Looking first at Exhibit Number 9, up in the
6	top, there is a line that says, "Spreading
7	the Word." Do you see that?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. is that the RE line?
10	A. Yes. That's the reference line.
11	Q. When you saw that "spreading the
12	word," what did you understand that to mean?
Page 280
13	A. Just what it says, that Robert was
14	-- you know, Robert has often tackled the
15	issue of professional historians serving as
16	expert witnesses. He's spoken and published
17	on this. I assumed it was more of that.
18	Q. Have you spoken with him about what
19	he meant by the term "spreading the word"?
20	A. No.
21	Q. Well, in this case, he was spreading
22	the word about research assistants that were
23	working for Dr. Gregg Michel, wasn't he?
24	A. Right. That's a little different
25	and not something that I approve of.
1	Q. Okay. You just said you didn't
2	approve of it when you got this e-mail. Did
3	you say anything to Dr. Proctor, such as,
4	what are you doing? I don't approve of
5	this? Why are you sending me this?
6	A. I didn't think much of this. I
7	mean, I didn't think it was -- you know, I
8	skimmed it very quickly and didn't think it
9	required any commentary or action on my
10	part. It didn't involve me. And so I just
11	moved on in my e-mail.
12	Q. So you thought nothing amiss about
13	this when you received it?
14	A. Right. Yeah. I mean, there's not
15	-- in this particular note, I mean, as I sit
Page 281
16	and read it now, I mean, there's nothing in
17	here except descriptive material. So that's
18	-- I mean, the e-mail says what it says.
19	Q. Okay, well, the first line, which
20	looks like the line that Dr. Proctor
21	addressed to you, it says, "FYI, my recent
22	exchange with Professor Betty Smocovitis at
23	the University of Florida, a history of
24	science colleague. Note her astonishment."
25	What did you understand when he said, "note
1	her astonishment"?
2	A. Oh, I mean, it's a common reaction
3	that I've gotten when, you know, people
4	learn that there are historians that work
5	for the tobacco industry. It's not widely
6	publicized. Even though all this is public,
7	it's not in the newspaper. It's not
8	discussed at professional meetings and
9	gatherings.
10	And the reality is that some people
11	are, in fact, astonished when they learn
12	that other professional historians are
13	working as consultants for the tobacco
14	industry.
15	Q. Have you and Dr. Proctor ever
16	discussed that kind of astonishment?
17	A. Not that I can recall. I mean, it's
18	something I've had just when I've talked to
Page 282
19	people just on a day-to-day basis.
20	Q. Well, who have you talked to about
21	it?
22	A. Well, for example, one of the people
23	that I acknowledge in my article, a guy
24	named Fitzhugh Brundage, years ago, I mean,
25	years ago, mentioned this. I said, well,
1	you know, I'm testifying in a tobacco case.
2	And he said, really? Why would a historian
3	do that? I said, actually, there's
4	historians on both sides. He said, really?
5	That's -- and then I explained. I said,
6	well, they have this defense. They say
7	this. You know, I have a different view.
8	And that's how that works.
9	Q. Anything else that you discussed
10	with -- was it Mr. Brundage?
11	A. That's it. I mean, this is years
12	ago.
13	Q. Okay, is he a professor at the
14	University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill?
15	A. Yes. who knows? Maybe he's --
16	maybe you've retained him.
17	Q. Have you ever talked to him about
18	tobacco litigation other than that one
19	conversation --
20	A. Well, he read my article in -- you
21	know, when I was writing it, you know. And
Page 283
22	he has worked as an expert witness in a
23	variety of capacities. I'm not completely
24	sure, but he's done other cases.
25	Q. Did he provide any comments to your
1	article?
2	A. He said he liked it.
3	Q. Anything else?
4	A. No. That was it.
5	Q. Okay. And you notice, in the top of
6	this e-mail, it has the names of several
7	research assistants that worked with Dr.
8	Mi chel.
9	A. Uh-huh.
10	Q. Do you know where those names came
11	from?
12	A. Well, apparently, those names were
13	actually disclosed when Mr. Michel was asked
14	who his research assistants were in the
15	deposition.
16	Q. And that deposition was done by Mr.
17	Sayles in the Campbell case?
18	A. Right.
19	Q. Do you know why Mr. Sayles asked Dr.
20	Michel who his research assistants were?
21	A. No.
22	Q. Did you ever discuss with Mr. Sayles
23	asking names of research assistants?
24	A. No.
1	A. with Mr. Sayles?
2	Q. Uh-huh.
3	A. No. No. I mean, I've often been
4	asked the names of the research assistants
5	that I've used, and have always, you know,
6	indicated who was helping.
7	Q. Okay. And you see the second
8	paragraph up here in this first e-mail --
9	there's several e-mails in the string, but
10	the second paragraph starts out, "The only
11	faculty member I know from your department
12	who worked for the industry is Augustus
13	Burns, III"?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. Did you know Professor Burns?
16	A. I did know him.
17	Q. Did you ever discuss tobacco
18	litigation with him?
19	A. No. I met him when I was an
20	undergraduate, and he's passed away, some
21	time ago, and had -- he was included in my
22	research set from my data study, I think one
23	deposition.
24	Q. Okay. And the last couple of
25	sentences in this paragraph read, and you
1	tell me if I read them wrong, it says, "in
2	my view, this is historical malpractice and
3	I would be very interested to know if the
4	advisors of these students know what they
5	have been doing. I can send you testimony
6	of Michel where he lays this out, if you
7	1 i ke. "
8	Did I read that correctly?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. The first sentence, "in my view,
11	this is historical malpractice," is that a
12	view that you share with Dr. Proctor?
13	A. Well, that's his term. I disagree
14	with the methods, the research materials and
15	the conclusions that the defense historians
16	have given, and I lay that out very
17	carefully in my tobacco control article.
18	My position is that, you know, it
19	falls below the standard of what we would
20	call peer review scholarship, in my opinion,
21	and is not supported by a fair and accurate
22	reading of the evidence, using the methods,
23	the materials that are normally acknowledged
24	in my profession.
25	We don't have malpractice, per se,
1	in history, so historical malpractice could
2	only be, like, a metaphorical description.
3	I've not used that term, so I described it
4	my way. That's Dr. Proctor's term.
5	Q. Have you discussed with Dr. Proctor
6	his use of this term, historical
7	malpractice?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Have you seen him use it before this
10	e-mail?
11	A. I think he might use that in his
12	article. I'm not recalling. But, you know,
13	he's got one that is in the same -- you know
14	what I'm talking about. He may use that
15	term in there, but it's been a while since
16	he did that.
17	Q. Aside from the articles that both
18	you and Dr. Proctor have written, have the
19	two of you discussed your views about the
20	practices of defense historians?
21	A. Over the years?
22	Q. Uh-huh.
23	A. Yes. Oh, we've talked about it,
24	particularly when we are working on the data
25	essay. And, you know, that's why when I've
1	-- you know, I've found I had a new
2	professional historian that was working for
3	the industry that had testified, Mr. Michel,
4	I just said, you know, here it is. if I had
5	not been forwarded the deposition, you know,
6	I might have forwarded him the name, just
7	because he likes to keep track of that.
8	Q. Do you know if Dr. Proctor is
9	planning on doing any further articles about
10	defense historians?
11	A. I don't know.
12	Q. Have you discussed that with him?
13	A. No.
14	Q. The substance of the discussions
15	that you've had about your criticisms of
16	defense historians, what has that been?
17	A. Well, the main -- the main criticism
18	is -- and it's the one that I lay out in my
19	article that I have, which is the failure to
20	adequately employ the industry archives.
21	Q. So they don't look at internal
22	company documents?
23	A. Right.
24	Q. Anything else you've discussed with
25	Dr. Proctor?
1	A. Well, the use of polls. The things
2	I lay out in my data article. I'm very
3	clear about my disagreements.
4	Q. Anything other than what's laid out
5	in your article?
6	A. No. That's it.
7	Q. He goes on to say in his e-mail, "I
8	would be very interested to know if the
9	advisors of these students know what they
10	have been doing." what do you understand
11	that to mean?
12	A. I was asked this in the Barbanell
13	deposition, and my response to that is the
14	same, which is, you know, an advisor/advisee
15	relationship is one of trust, and mentor and
16	menteeship, and as long as the advisor is,
17	you know, appraised of that, for two
18	reasons. One, which is probably the one
19	you're thinking of, they're working for the
20	tobacco industry. But the other is, you
21	know, as advisors, we're charged with making
22	sure that students expeditiously move
23	through the program, as much as we can.
24	There's limits to what you can do. But it
25	is important to at least be appraised of any
1	significant outside work, you know, so that
2	you can best advise the students on how to
3	get the dissertation done, if that's the
4	phase that they're in, if they're in that
5	phase of their education.
6	Q. Okay. By this statement, do you
7	think Dr. Proctor was intending to elicit
8	some sort of censure of the students on
9	behalf of their advisors?
10	MR. OGLE:
11	Form objection.
12	A. No. I mean, that's not necessarily
13	-- not necessarily. I don't interpret it
14	that way.
15	MS. LAWSON:
16	Q. So you don't interpret that to mean
17	that he thinks that the advisors would
18	censure the students if they knew what the
19	students were doing?
20	A. Well, hard to know. I mean, I --
21	you know, I certainly wouldn't want someone
22	to censure a student that I hired to help
23	me. I don't think that would be fair. So
24	you are going to have to ask him about his
25	words.
1	Q. Okay. That's fine. But I take it
2	you wouldn't like it if a defense historian
3	sent e-mails to a university where you had a
4	research assistant working and made a
5	comment like that?
6	MR. OGLE:
7	Form objection.
8	A. I wouldn't.
9	MS. LAWSON:
10	Q. After you received this e-mail, did
11	you ever ask Dr. Proctor not to send you
12	further e-mails like this?
13	A. No. But I didn't -- no, I didn't.
14	I mean, I just ignored it, and he sent me
15	the one that I never read, and I didn't ask
16	him.
17	Q. Let's go onto Exhibit 10, if we may.
18	This is the one you thought you were cc'd
19	on?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. And the RE line on this is "Tobacco
22	Narrative Resumed"?
23	A. Right.
24	Q. Do you know what it was resumed
25	from?
1	A. I suspect that there's probably
2	correspondence between Robert Proctor and
3	Ms. Smocovitis that, you know, that that's
4	RE. There's probably more, you know,
5	between them. I just have these two.
6	Q. And you told us earlier that you
7	spoke with Dr. Proctor, I think it was
8	Friday night?
9	A. Or afternoon.
10	Q. Or afternoon. And you didn't
11	discuss either of these e-mails with him?
12	A. Oh, no.
13	Q. Okay. By either of the e-mails, I
14	mean Exhibits 9 or 10.
15	A. Exhibits 9 or 10.
16	Q. Was there any reason you didn't
17	mention it?
18	A. I didn't want to talk to him about
19	this. He's heading into a period of --
20	where he's going to be testifying and I just
21	-- I think it's best not to discuss this.
22	There's nothing to be gained from it.
23	Q. I'm going to refer you to the top
24	portion, starting with the second sentence.
25	It says -- and you tell me if I read it
1	correctly. "They also don't realize how
2	working with the industry has corrupted both
3	the substance of inquiry and academic
4	politics." Did I read that correctly?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. What do you understand that to mean?
7	A. Well, I'm not sure to all that he's
8	referring to. I don't know about the
9	politics part. I mean, I just don't know
10	what that means.
11	On the substance of inquiry, I mean,
12	to the extent that people might publish
13	research but not acknowledge their -- you
14	know, not disclose their competing
15	interests, I think that's probably what that
16	refers to.
17	Q. Okay, well, in the article that you
18	have authored, in which you talk
19	disparagingly about defense historians, did
20	you disclose that you work for plaintiffs?
21	A. I did. in fact -- I did. And the
22	rule in medical publications is that you
23	have to do that, which is a good rule. I
24	would like to see that adopted by the
25	historical profession, generally.
1	Q. And how did you go about doing that?
2	What did you do?
3	A. Oh, at the end of the article,
4	there's a section, which is like a standard
5	section, I think it's called competing
6	interests, where I say that I have served as
7	an expert witness for plaintiffs in the
8	tobacco litigation, including in some of the
9	cases discussed in this article. And I
10	named the cases, including Boerner v. Brown
11	& Williamson and Eastman v. Philip Morris,
12	so that somebody could use that to evaluate
13	that, and if they think that's a source of
14	bias, then they can make that opinion on
15	their own.
16	Q. Are you aware of any historians
17	who've worked for defendants in smoking and
18	health suits who have published articles or
19	any sorts of writings on smoking and health
20	and not disclosed that they had worked with
21	defense firms?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Who?
24	A. James Kirby Martin published a
25	review of Allan Brandt's book in the Journal
1	of Social History. I forget which issue.
2	it's been within the last year.
3	Q. Anyone else you can think of?
4	A. That's -- as I recall, I don't think
5	there's any discussion of John Burnham's --
6	well, that's the one that comes to mind.
7	Q. Okay. Have you ever talked with Dr.
8	Martin about that?
9	A. No. I mean, I just happened to read
10	that review.
11	Q. The next sentence -- going back to
12	the e-mail, the next sentence says,
13	"Historians are a bit backward on this; they
14	seem to find it difficult to deal with an
15	issue of ethical professional situation that
16	in the biomedical sciences would be a
17	clear-cut violation of ethics."
18	Do you understand what Dr. Proctor
19	means by that?
20	A. Well, he's -- you know, he's talking
21	to a medical historian or a science
22	historian, and so I interpret this to be
23	along the lines of his criticism that he
24	raises in his tobacco control article. I
25	guess, you know, if you are a historian of
1	medicine, you know, maybe you shouldn't work
2	for the tobacco industry. I think that's
3	what he's saying. But these are his words,
4	not mine.
5	Q. Do you believe that Dr. Proctor is
6	saying that historians shouldn't work for
7	tobacco companies?
8	A. I think what he's saying is that if
9	they do, it needs to be disclosed, you know,
10	and it should be done out in the open, which
11	is, I think, you know, reasonable.
12	Q. Have you discussed with Dr. Proctor
13	his beliefs about whether historians should
14	work with tobacco companies?
15	A. Well, I think he holds the opinion
16	that one of the ways in which the tobacco
17	industry has maintained its viability has
18	been through fending off attacks in civil
19	litigation through product liability, that
20	this has been a factor in maintaining the
21	economic viability of the industry. So to
22	the degree that, you know, he sees this as
23	-- and I think anybody involved in public
24	health sees this as a preventable cause of
25	death, there's a certain complicity there
1	with -- you know, with keeping the cigarette
2	as a viable deadly product in American life.
3	Q. That's an answer, but my question
4	was actually, have you ever discussed this
5	with him?
6	A. Oh, yes. I mean, that's the
7	position he's explained to me, which I --
8	that's the discussion and he's --
9	Q. Anything else?
10	A. That's it. I mean, and I think he's
11	published on that position. He's pretty
12	clear about that.
13	Q. Do you agree with Dr. Proctor that
14	historians should not work with tobacco
15	companies?
16	A. I don't have -- I diverge with him
17	on this, it's not the act of being retained
18	by a law firm that's representing the
19	tobacco company, which is actually the
20	technical process.
21	I think that their testimony is
22	flawed, deeply, you know, deeply, deeply
23	flawed. So that's really where my
24	disagreement comes. I, myself, have worked,
25	on occasion, for defense firms on smoking
1	and health, but with the asbestos company,
2	and I felt comfortable with my testimony,
3	and that I stuck to my methods and materials
Page 296
4	that I've been trained to use and I feel
5	good about that.
6	Now, I suspect that the defense
7	historians would say the same thing about
8	their behavior. But I do disagree with
9	their conclusions and their arguments.
10	Q. Other than their conclusions, do you
11	disagree that they should work with tobacco
12	companies at all?
13	A. No. I don't think that's an
14	appropriate position because under the
15	system that we have, everybody is entitled
16	to a defense, you know, just as you, as
17	attorneys, you know, represent your client
18	as advocates. Now, the historians should
19	not be advocates, but I don't -- I don't
20	have a problem with them, per se, working
21	for the industry.
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. And if you read my article
24	carefully, I never say that.
25	Q. Going on, it says, historians --
1	back to Exhibit 10. "Historians are naive
2	innocents in this respect and don't seem to
3	have digested (or know about) the critiques
4	of Kyriakoudes, Brandt and myself."
5	Did I read that correctly?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. What do you understand that to mean?
8	A. Nobody has read my article, it sits
9	on the shelf, you know, which is so common
10	with scholarship.
11	But, yes, I mean, nobody knows, at
12	least my work. Not nobody, but it's out
13	there, but -- you know, it's not getting
14	widely cited, it's doing what it does.
15	Q. Okay. Do you believe that it is
16	necessary for historians, in order to be
17	able to render accurate opinions, to be
18	aware of the critiques that you and Dr.
19	Brandt and Dr. Proctor have done?
20	A. Well, I think -- I think that would
21	be good. I think that would be helpful. I
22	think my article should be read by every,
23	you know, non-medical historian that's
24	working for the tobacco industry. I think I
25	offer -- and who knows. Maybe they have
1	read it. Then at least somebody's reading
2	it. I think it's something they should take
3	into account because I think I raised
4	important issues of method.
5	Q. Do you believe it's necessary for a
6	historian to read your article, however good
7	you may believe your article to be, in order
8	to render accurate testimony?
9	A. Necessary? No. They don't have to
Page 298
10	read my article to render accurate
11	testimony.
12	Q. Have you ever discussed with Dr.
13	Proctor whether it's necessary for
14	historians to read the critiques that you
15	and he and Brandt make?
16	A. No. I've never discussed it that
17	way.
18	Q. Have you discussed it in any way?
19	A. Well, when we were working on these
20	pieces back in earlier in this decade, and
21	we had our meetings with the data group and
22	everything, you know, we did talk about how
23	-- and we had -- the three of us gave a
24	joint presentation in San Francisco, and
25	there was a very interesting post discussion
1	afterwards, which I -- it was a Shook,
2	Hardy, Bacon. There was young people there
3	taking notes. And they were welcome to
4	that. So you should have a reasonable
5	record of what we said there. People were
6	interested and we talked about it.
7	Q. Anything beyond that that you've
8	discussed?
9	A. No. Just what we've discussed
10	there, and when we were working on the
11	articles. I mean, he and I -- we didn't
12	collaborate, but we did communicate quite a
Page 299
13	bit during that period under that grant.
14	Q. And then the last paragraph in this
15	first e-mail says, "If I were you, I would
16	raise a simple question at the next faculty
17	meeting: Do we, as a faculty, think it is a
18	good idea for graduate students to be
19	working secretly for the tobacco company?
20	That should generate some good discussion
21	and clear some of the air. I think the
22	majority of your faculty will do the right
23	thing; the 20 or 30 percent who think these
24	are purely private matters don't stand up
25	very well when presented with facts.
1	Collaboration of this sort is really only
2	possible when no one raises it as an ethical
3	issue. Let me know how it goes. R.P."
4	Did I read that correctly?
5	A. You read that correctly.
6	Q. What do you understand that to mean?
7	A. Exactly what he says.
8	Q. That he's instructing Professor
9	Smocovitis to go to a faculty meeting and
10	basically try and get these RAs in trouble,
11	these research assistants?
12	MR. OGLE:
13	Form objection.
14	A. That's not what he's saying.
15	MS. LAWSON:
16	Q. Well, you tell me what you think it
17	means then.
18	MR. OGLE:
19	Form objection to that, too. Go
20	ahead.
21	A. Go to the faculty meeting and raise
22	the issue if it's proper for graduate
23	students to work doing this secretly. Maybe
24	they should do it openly. Because it's not
25	really secret.
1	Q. No. it's not really secret, is it?
2	A. Everything is written down. There's
3	nothing -- and, you know, the point that I
4	made about this was, the advisors should be
5	appraised of this to the extent or whomever
6	is mentoring them or even the people who are
7	engaging them to work, you know, if there's
8	someone, let's say, at the university of
9	Florida that's also like an armchair
10	consultant for you guys, they do have an
11	obligation to make sure that they accurately
12	represent what's being done, which is
13	basically, look, you know, it's litigation,
14	you know, we need your research assistants.
15	We are going to be telling you what to look
16	up. That's your role in it. But it's not
17	secret. I mean, if you are okay with that,
18	that's great, but just make sure that it --
Page 301
19	that they fully inform the students as to
20	what the full nature of the activity is, so
21	that they can make an informed choice on
22	their part.
23	Q. Do you know if there were already
24	faculty members at the University of Florida
25	who were aware of what the research
1	assistants were doing?
2	A. I have no idea. I was just using
3	that as a hypothetical. I have no idea.
4	Q. So there could have been?
5	A. Maybe or maybe not. I don't know.
6	Q. So you don't know if it was secret
7	or it wasn't secret?
8	A. No. He uses the term.
9	Q. What do you think he means by, "I
10	think the majority of your faculty will do
11	the right thing"?
12	MR. OGLE:
13	Form objection.
14	A. I'm not sure what he means by that.
15	MS. LAWSON:
16	Q. Do you think that possibly could be
17	some sort of censure on the research
18	assistants?
19	MR. OGLE:
20	Same objection.
21	A. You have to ask him. I mean, I
Page 302
22	didn't write this.
23	MS. LAWSON:
24	Q. I understand. I'm just asking what
25	your understanding is.
1	A. I don't know what he means by that.
2	Q. In the next e-mail down below that
3	in the string, there is a discussion of Gus
4	Burns, who we already talked about, and
5	someone named Fred. Do you know who Fred
6	was or is?
7	A. No.
8	MR. OGLE:
9	Gus is Bubba. we know that.
10	A. No. I don't know who Fred is. Does
11	it -- do they mention the name further on
12	down?
13	MS. LAWSON:
14	Q. They don't mention a last name, no.
15	A. You know, the only way to figure
16	this out would be me to go back to an older
17	copy of the American Historical
18	Association's Guide to Department of History
19	and see who was teaching in Florida before
20	Gus passed away.
21	Q. Have you ever had any discussions
22	with Dr. Proctor about his beliefs as to why
23	certain historians worked with tobacco
24	companies?
25	A. Well, I've mentioned to him. I
1	think that, you know, money is a strong
2	motive. I mean, historians are not well
3	paid, and, you know, it's a very attractive
4	supplement to one's earnings.
5	Q. And as we've talked about here
6	today, you've had a very attractive
7	supplement to your earnings this year, based
8	on your litigation work.
9	A. That's right. And so I think that's
10	-- but that's just me, you know, surmising.
11	I've not done a study of this or even asked
12	anybody. I'm always the cheapest thing in
13	the room.
14	MR. OGLE:
15	I wouldn't say that. I'm not
16	getting paid a penny so far.
17	MS. LAWSON:
18	Q. Do you have any intention of ever
19	talking with Dr. Proctor about these? And
20	by "these," I mean Exhibits 9 and 10.
21	A. No. I think it's best not to
22	discuss this with him.
23	Q. Do you have any intention of asking
24	Dr. Proctor not to send you any further
25	e-mails?
1	A. I think he's not going to be sending
2	me any other e-mails, since he's run into
3	this. I mean, I think it's without any --
4	you know, it's a trouble for him, and one
5	that he's created and, yes, I hope he
6	doesn't send me these things again.
7	Again, I want to reiterate what I
8	said all along, that this is not anything
9	that I would have ever done on my own and
10	acted on on my own, and I just wanted to
11	point that out about my own behavior.
12	Q. is it fair to say that you basically
13	disagree with the substance of what Dr.
14	Proctor says in these e-mails?
15	MR. OGLE:
16	Form objection.
17	A. Well, I disagree with the -- I
18	disagree with the second paragraph.
19	MS. LAWSON:
20	Q. The second paragraph in which one?
21	A. In Number 10, at the top that we
22	talked about.
23	Q. So that's not anything that you
24	would ever counsel a faculty member at a
25	university to do?
1	A. To --
2	Q. To go into a faculty meeting and
3	say, hey, we have research assistants here
4	that are working for the tobacco industry,
5	isn't everyone upset about that?
6	A. No. I would never do that.
7	MS. LAWSON:
8	I don't have any more questions
9	about it.
10	EXAMINATION
11	BY MR. HENK:
12	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, why were you
13	astonished that a historian would become
14	retained to give testimony on behalf of a
15	cigarette manufacturer defendant?
16	A. I didn't say I was astonished, when
17	I was asked that question, I said that --
18	and I have described this to other
19	colleagues, and I gave you an example of one
20	person, Fitzhugh Brundage, that they had
21	expressed astonishment or surprise.
22	Q. You don't find it astonishing?
23	A. Well, you know, it's just what it
24	is, you know. I disagree with all the
25	things that we've been talking about, but
1	I'm not that astonished, no.
2	Q. Let me ask you about just a few
3	pieces of what you know occurs. Let me ask
4	you about finding out where a smoker lived
5	and then looking at the newspapers that that
6	smoker actually says they subscribed to. Do
7	you think that's inappropriate?
8	A. No. You know, I've been on -- I
9	mean, you can go and read my critique, and
10	I'm very precise, you know. Enter into
11	evidence my article.
12	My disagreement is that -- I believe
13	that the historians have an obligation not
14	just to kind of do the research that the
15	client says, you know, I want to know about
16	this. And you can do that, you know, and
17	you write up a report and they can take that
18	into account as they prepare for litigation
19	because you need to know, as anybody
20	involved in litigation, needs to know the
21	facts and what experts think on this.
22	But I think the historians have an
23	obligation to their profession to raise the
24	full set of tools that we have available.
25	I think, you know, if they went in
1	and looked at -- and looked at the internal
2	documents and made an evaluation of those
3	documents, maybe their reading would be
4	different than mine. I'm not suggesting
5	that you have to come to the same conclusion
6	that I draw, but if they -- if they looked
7	at those documents and wrestled with them
8	and then came -- then they might come to a
9	conclusion still that supports what they've
10	said or not.
11	But by putting those blinders on, I
12	think they deeply impair their ability to
13	effectively act or to fully act given -- in
14	their historical training and their
15	historical judgment. I mean, that's my main
16	thing. That and the sampling thing with the
17	Scholastic, all that's just -- I also single
18	that out for a special program in my
19	article.
20	But if they were to take account of
21	the internal documents and, you know,
22	integrate the tobacco industry into the
23	history of smoking in America, then I would
24	not have as much of a disagreement with
25	them. I mean, we might come to different
1	conclusions, but that methodological
2	disagreement that I have would not exist.
3	Q. How, specifically, do you think
4	internal company documents that were not
5	disclosed to the public should impact an
6	opinion on what the public knew?
7	A. Again, as I say in my article,
8	first, many of these historians used polls.
9	And if you are going to use polls, you need
10	to use all the polls, including the industry
11	polls, which many of them are very good.
12	They're done by the same organizations,
13	Prime American, Family Opinion, Gallup, and
14	alike. But they ask really focused
15	questions on the issue of awareness of
16	smoking and health and other attributes, you
17	know, of the smokers.
18	So, you know, why would you use a
19	poll that's essentially an evaluative
20	instrument that measures some aspect of
21	knowledge that's available to the public but
22	not use the one that may be better, done by
23	the same company, that was commissioned by,
24	say, for example, The Tobacco institute? I
25	don't get that.
1	And what I don't understand -- and
2	maybe you should think about this with your
3	historians, so what if they see the internal
4	documents? They can read those. You know,
5	they can deal with those. I mean, there are
6	some damaging documents in there, but, you
7	know, maybe they come to a different
8	position. So that's one example.
9	You know, another is if they're
10	going to make evaluations about what the
11	public knew at any particular point in time,
12	they've got to deal with the tobacco
13	industry as an agent in this story. I mean,
14	the industry is the 900-pound gorilla.
15	Now, their power is not complete.
16	Maybe they could come to a different opinion
17	than mine, but they need to -- they need to
18	consider this evidence. That's really the
19	substance of my criticism, and if you read
20	the article, that's what I say.
21	And here are the things I don't talk
22	about in that article. I don't talk about
23	money. I have a little history of how the
24	litigation got started, but that's just kind
25	of a narrative because I found those
1	wonderful documents in the Bliley
2	collection.
3	Q. Has Dr. Proctor told you that he
4	wants the defendants to lose Engle progeny
5	cases?
6	A. No. He has not expressed that; nor
7	have I expressed to him. I -- you know, I
8	don't have any -- no.
9	Q. Have you inferred from anything that
10	Dr. Proctor has told you that led you to
11	believe that he wants the defendants to lose
12	Engle progeny cases?
13	A. He is more interested in the winning
14	and losing than I am. I will say that. I
15	believe that he actually -- I seem to recall
16	that he actually lists on his CV -- he lists
17	the cases that he's testified in and he
18	lists the outcome. You know, which you
19	could infer an interest in that. I don't do
20	that.
21	Q. So the answer is yes?
22	A. Yes. I'm not going to infer that,
23	yes.
24	Q. In fact, has Dr. Proctor told you
25	that he wants the defendants to go out of
1	business?
2	A. He hasn't said that. I think he's
3	expressed to me the idea that a
4	cigarette-free society would be a desirable
5	goal, a policy goal.
6	Q. Do you want the defendants to go out
7	of business?
8	A. No. I've been asked this many
9	times, and, you know, I was once asked what
10	I wanted, and I said that in the Reller
11	deposition, and you can refer to that answer
12	because I was quite specific. I neither
13	want them to go out of business or stay in
14	business. That's not my position to say. I
15	would like to see fewer people smoke because
16	it is absolutely a deadly scourge on public
17	health. But it's not my place to say
18	whether a company should go out of business
19	or not.
20	Q. So this sentence in Exhibit 9 that
21	says, the -- I may mispronounce his name,
22	Michel, et al, assignment was to read all
23	Pensacola papers from the 1950s and
24	succeeding decades to find examples of
25	smoking and health stories to which smokers
1	would have been exposed.
2	Anything inappropriate about that
3	assignment, in your mind, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
4	A. Only if that's all that Mr. Michel
5	would do to support his opinion. And the
6	term "inappropriate" is not a term I would
7	say. You know, incomplete.
8	Q. The fact is, there's nothing
9	inappropriate about that assignment, is
10	there?
11	A. No. No. it's just -- as a research
12	methodology, it's incomplete.
13	Q. And in the next sentence, when it
14	says, "The argument is then made in court
15	that only an ostrich or a moron could have
16	failed to realize that cigarettes cause
17	death and injury, so plaintiffs don't
18	deserve compensation."
19	What is your understanding of what
20	-- of who is making that argument?
21	MR. OGLE:
22	Form objection.
23	A. Well, I think that's a
24	characterization of some of the testimony of
25	defense historians.
1	MR. HENK:
2	Q. Are you aware of a defense historian
3	saying that only an ostrich or an moron
4	could have failed to realize that cigarettes
5	cause death and injury?
6	A. I've not seen anybody use that exact
7	language, no.
8	Q. Have you heard of any defense
9	historian stating that plaintiffs don't
10	deserve compensation?
11	A. well, I don't think this sentence is
12	saying that the historians take that
13	position. I think that's -- there's a
14	double dash, so plaintiffs don't deserve
15	compensation would really be the argument of
16	the attorneys.
17	Q. That's right. This sentence that
18	starts, "the argument," you understand it to
19	mean the argument of counsel, correct?
20	A. Right. Yes.
21	Q. And in Dr. Proctor's view, in the
22	next sentence, "in my view, this is
23	historical malpractice." He's accusing the
24	counsel of historical malpractice, in your
25	view, correct?
1	MR. OGLE:
2	Form objection.
3	MR. HENK:
4	I knew you would do that, if you
5	waited long enough.
6	MR. OGLE:
7	Well, if you just keep asking him to
8	speculate on everything in this document,
9	you are going to get objections.
10	MR. HENK:
11	There's a big difference between
12	what did he mean, meaning Mr. Proctor mean
13	by that, and your understanding of it. You
14	have your own understanding.
15	A. Well, my understanding of this is
16	the historical malpractice refers to the
17	historians. I mean, I think that's what he
18	means there. And, you know, it's an e-mail
19	that was probably written quickly, or not, I
20	don't know. It's -- I mean, the view here
21	is that historians play a role by providing
22	the means for counsel to make that argument.
23	Q. Are you aware that some states
24	consider smoking and health lawsuits to be
25	frivolous?
1	MR. OGLE:
2	Form objection.
3	A. I'm not aware of that, but I -- I
4	don't keep up on the law. I'm not a lawyer.
5	MR. HENK:
6	All right. That's all I have.
7	EXAMINATION
8	BY MR. OGLE:
9	I have a few, and I promise I won't
10	be as long because I am more tired than
11	most, I think.
12	Q. Let's see. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I think
13	we're pronouncing this Dr. Michel correctly.
14	Is that right?
15	A. That's right, yes. That's how I
16	understand it to be pronounced.
17	Q. Were you -- are you aware of who --
18	which lawyer was present at the deposition
19	of Dr. Michel when David Sayles asked the
20	question about the research assistants?
21	A. Do you mean the defense lawyer?
22	Q. Yes.
23	A. No. I don't know who that was.
24	Q. But are you aware of whether any
25	objections were made by any of the defense
1	lawyers present to the questions that were
2	asked and the answers given that disclosed
3	the names of the research assistants at the
Page 315
4	University of Florida?
5	A. I'm not aware of any because I
6	haven't actually read that deposition except
7	for the first couple of pages.
8	Q. Okay. And do you understand that
9	when a deposition is taken, such as what's
10	being done today, that it's being
11	transcribed?
12	A. Yes. I understand that.
13	Q. And that the transcription becomes
14	part of a court record?
15	A. That's right.
16	Q. And do you understand this is a
17	public discussion here, this is not
18	something private or confidential or secret?
19	A. Yes. I understand that.
20	Q. And with that, do you understand
21	that would be the case when Dr. Michel is
22	examined, as well, that when he was examined
23	for a deposition, it was a public exchange
24	and not a private or secret one?
25	A. That's correct.
1	Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, if you had a
2	research assistant who was working with you,
3	is that a relationship in which you
4	supervised the research assistant's
5	activities?
6	A. Yes. I mean, I, you know, give them
Page 316
7	a task and they go do the task.
8	Q. And is that -- do you feel like --
9	when I was at University of Florida Law
10	School, the students were not allowed to
11	have outside work during the course of their
12	law studies. In other words, the University
13	of Florida Law School had a certain
14	supervision over us as students.
15	Does the university here where you
16	work, University of Southern Mississippi,
17	have a certain relationship with the
18	research assistants, where they have some
19	level of responsibility of what the research
20	assistants do?
21	A. Yes. We supervise them.
22	Q. So do you think it's appropriate,
23	then, for research assistants to keep secret
24	professional activities from their research
25	supervisors, such as yourself?
1	MR. HENK:
2	Object to the form.
3	MS. LAWSON:
4	Same objection.
5	A. No. No. You shouldn't keep -- I
6	mean, if you are doing something that you
7	need to keep secret, maybe you should think
8	twice about why you are doing that.
9	MR. OGLE:
10	Q. Right. And so, now, diverging a
11	little bit, a historian, such as yourself,
12	who is doing work in a public location, such
13	as this, in this -- this is essentially a
14	courtroom, do you think that historian is
15	entitled to anonymity or secrecy about what
16	they're doing?
17	A. No. It's a public forum.
18	Everything is being written down.
19	Q. And so your only concern, then,
20	about what Dr. Proctor did in disclosing the
21	identity of the research assistants at the
22	University of Florida is that they were not
23	historians, per se; that is, they had not
24	actually gotten their degrees, but, rather
25	they were graduate students or research
1	assistants, and therefore, you think that's
2	something you, yourself, would not do; is
3	that right?
4	MR. HENK:
5	Objection, leading, mischaracterizes
6	his testimony.
7	MS. LAWSON:
8	I concur and same objection.
9	A. That's correct. And I've been
10	explicit that many times when I have been
11	asked about this.
12	MR. OGLE:
13	Q. So if Dr. Proctor had disclosed to
14	the University of Florida information about
15	historians who were actually, like yourself,
16	you know, fully, you know, titled and
17	working, who were actually working for the
18	tobacco industry, you wouldn't -- would you
19	have any disagreement with his doing that?
20	A. No. I mean, we've published on
21	this. There's no -- I mean, there's no
22	secret to this.
23	Q. Right. And the historians who were
24	working for tobacco companies are not
25	entitled to work in secret, in your opinion;
1	is that right?
2	A. No. Often, these trials are
3	covered --
4	MR. HENK:
5	Objection to form.
6	MS. LAWSON:
7	Objection.
8	A. -- are covered in the press.
9	MR. OGLE:
10	Q. Now, let's look for a second at this
11	issue of anonymity -- of research
12	assistants. Now, we talked about
13	historians, themselves. Now, let's talk
14	about research assistants. And you said
15	that you -- you remember you said that the
Page 319
16	assistants -- that the person supervising
17	the assistant really needs to know what
18	professional activities that assistant is
19	engaged in.
20	MR. HENK:
21	Object to the form.
22	MS. LAWSON:
23	Object to the form.
24	A. Yes.
25	MR. OGLE:
1	Q. Now, have you ever had a research
2	assistant who was secretly working for an
3	organization, like the mafia, who had been
4	convicted of criminal RICO violations?
5	MR. HENK:
6	Objection to form.
7	MS. LAWSON:
8	Objection to form.
9	MR. OGLE:
10	Q. Have you ever had that happen?
11	A. No. Not that I know of.
12	MR. HENK:
13	Can I interrupt for a second? Can
14	we have an agreement that an objection by
15	one of us will be an objection for both
16	defendants?
17	MR. OGLE:
18	Certainly. Yes.
Page 320
19	MR. HENK:
20	And we'll try not to do them at the
21	same time, here.
22	MR. OGLE:
23	That's all right.
24	Q. Are you aware, as we sit here today,
25	that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and
1	Philip Morris Tobacco Company have both been
2	convicted by a federal court in Washington,
3	D.C., affirmed by the Appeals Court in
4	Washington, D.C., of criminal RICO
5	violations? Are you aware of that?
6	MS. LAWSON:
7	Object to the form.
8	A. Yes. I'm aware of that.
9	MR. OGLE:
10	Q. Now, if you -- would you approve of
11	your research assistants working for
12	companies or individuals who had a history
13	of criminal felony violations and were
14	continuing in those activities? Would you
15	approve of that?
16	MS. LAWSON:
17	Object to form.
18	A. It's criminal?
19	MR. OGLE:
20	Q. Yes.
21	A. It was criminal? No. I wouldn't
Page 321
22	approve of that.
23	Q. And whether a supervisor of a
24	research assistant were to approve or not
25	approve, certainly, that supervisor would be
1	entitled to have an opinion in that regard?
2	MS. LAWSON:
3	Object to form.
4	A. Right. I think the policy should be
5	simply disclosure.
6	MR. OGLE:
7	Q. Right. And persons -- do you -- I
8	mean, the fact that you are working in a
9	legal arena as an expert witness, does that,
10	in your opinion, is that inconsistent with
11	your having personal opinions of your own?
12	MS. LAWSON:
13	Object to form.
14	A. No. I have lots of personal
15	opinions, and then I have my professional
16	scholarly judgments.
17	MR. OGLE:
18	Q. And do you, even as a scholar or an
19	expert witness, do you believe that you have
20	a right to moral opinions?
21	MS. LAWSON:
22	Object to form.
23	A. Absolutely.
24	MR. OGLE:
1	then, as well?
2	A. Yes.
3	MR. HENK:
4	Object to form.
5	MR. OGLE:
6	Q. So if Dr. Proctor has a moral
7	opinion, as a public health advocate, that
8	tobacco, as you said, is a deadly scourge,
9	would it be hypocritical for him to want the
10	tobacco companies to win these cases?
11	MS. LAWSON:
12	Object to form.
13	A. No. That would not be hypocritical.
14	I mean, no. The answer is no.
15	MR. OGLE:
16	Q. But would he be entitled to have
17	that opinion and have an opinion that,
18	perhaps, he wishes they would lose these
19	cases?
20	MS. LAWSON:
21	Object to the form.
22	A. Yes. Of course, he could have that
23	opinion.
24	MR. OGLE:
25	Q. And that wouldn't be unethical for
1	him to have that opinion?
2	A. No. No.
3	Q. As a matter of fact, are you aware
4	that the ama, American Medical Association,
5	has a strong opinion against smoking? Are
6	you aware of that?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And even though you keep your
9	professional objectivity as a historian,
10	would you want your daughters to smoke
11	cigarettes?
12	MS. LAWSON:
13	Object to form.
14	A. No. I don't want anyone to smoke
15	cigarettes.
16	MR. OGLE:
17	Q. I'd like to clarify the timeline in
18	Barbanell with you because I -- my memory is
19	a little different from what I heard you say
20	at one point. I just want to make sure the
21	record is very clear on this. Okay?
22	These e-mails came to you sometime,
23	it looks like, in late May and early June of
24	2009.
25	A. That's correct.
1	Q. All right. And the Barbanell
2	deposition was approximately when; do you
3	know?
4	A. It was at the end of June.
5	Q. The end of June of 2009?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And at that time, you were asked
8	about these e-mails, and at that time, did
9	you have a memory of having received these
10	e-mails from Dr. Proctor?
11	MR. HENK:
12	Objection, form.
13	A. No, I didn't. I wasn't -- you know,
14	I had not prepared for that kind of
15	questioning.
16	MR. OGLE:
17	Q. And you were asked it. And were
18	your answers honest at that time and
19	straightforward?
20	A. Yes.
21	MR. HENK:
22	Objection to form.
23	MR. OGLE:
24	Q. Now, did you go on vacation after
25	that deposition?
1	A. I did, yes.
2	Q. And when then did you discover that
3	you had, in fact, received these copies,
4	carbon copies of messages from Dr. Proctor?
5	MS. LAWSON:
6	Objection.
7	MR. HENK:
8	Objection to form.
9	A. In late July or early -- very early
10	August.
11	Q. Less than a month ago?
12	A. Yes. After the -- another
13	deposition called Grossman, where I had been
14	asked about this again, I went back into my
15	records to see what I had in there, and
16	that's where I discovered the one that I had
17	cursorily read, and then the one that I had
18	actually never read.
19	Q. And this was sometime after the
20	Grossman deposition?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. All right. And then has anyone told
23	you, any lawyer or anyone else told you that
24	you were, for any reason, required to have
25	immediately corrected the mistake that was
1	made in the Barbanell deposition?
2	MR. HENK:
3	Objection, form.
4	A. No.
5	MR. OGLE:
6	Q. And so since the Grossman
7	deposition, is this -- this, today, this
8	day, is this the first formal occasion you
9	have had to be in the presence of attorneys
10	for the tobacco companies?
11	MR. HENK:
12	Objection to form.
13	A. Well, I had a deposition last week.
14	MR. OGLE:
15	Q. Were you asked about this last week?
16	A. No.
17	MR. HENK:
18	Objection, form.
19	MR. OGLE:
20	Q. So is this the first occasion that
21	you have had in which you were asked by
22	attorneys for anybody, under oath, regarding
23	the fact of these e-mails?
24	MR. HENK:
25	Objection, form.
1	A. That's right. This would be the
2	first occasion.
3	MR. OGLE:
4	Q. And you've turned them over?
5	A. I turned them over.
6	Q. One last question, then, and I'm
7	finished. In these -- in this -- in the
8	GMail Number 10, Betty Smocovitis is writing
9	back on the second page, and she says, "I'm
10	afraid this is a case of shoot the
11	messenger, so I can't persist without
12	alienating myself further. As far as I
13	know, there has been no discussion of this
14	at the department level."
15	What do you understand by the word
16	"this"? What is she referring to; do you
17	know?
18	A. That pronoun, I think, refers to the
19	issue of the graduate students acting as
20	research assistants.
21	Q. And so is your understanding of what
22	she's telling Dr. Proctor, there has been no
23	discussion of this at the department level?
24	A. That's what --
25	MR. HENK:
1	Objection to form.
2	A. That's what she says in this e-mail.
3	MR. OGLE:
4	Q. "I have the awful feeling this kind
5	of thing will be common at universities that
6	are underfunded and where people feel that
7	such alternatives are the only way to
8	survive."
9	Do you understand from that -- what
10	is your understanding from that, whether the
11	students were disciplined in any way by the
12	University of Florida for working for the
13	tobacco companies?
14	MR. HENK:
15	Objection, form.
16	A. At least in this note, there's no
17	indication of any discipline or adverse
18	consequence.
19	MR. OGLE:
20	Q. And so do you believe that -- or do
21	you have an opinion whether in -- simply in
22	forming the research supervisors of the
23	professional activities of the research
24	assistants at the University of Florida,
25	which was public information, unobjected to
1	by the tobacco companies, Dr. Proctor did
2	anything ethically wrong?
3	MR. HENK:
4	Objection, form.
5	A. No.
6	MR. OGLE:
7	Q. No, he did not do anything ethically
8	wrong?
9	MR. HENK:
10	Objection, form.
11	A. No.
12	MR. OGLE:
13	Thank you. That's all I have.
14	MS. LAWSON:
15	I've got some follow-up questions.
16	VIDEO REPORTER:
17	We need to change the tape. This is
18	the end of Tape Number 5. The time is 7:44.
19	(Off the record.)
20	VIDEO REPORTER:
21	This is the beginning of tape Number
22	6. We're back on the record at 7:46.
23	EXAMINATION
24	BY MR. HENK:
25	Q. Doctor, assuming you answer it the
1	right way, I only have one question for you.
2	A. I'll let you answer it. Okay?
3	MR. OGLE:
4	That's intimidation.
5	MR. HENK:
6	Q. If an expert witness wants the party
7	on whose behalf he's -- he or she is
8	testifying to win, that expert has a bias,
9	correct?
10	A. Well, I mean, they do have a bias,
11	yes.
12	MR. HENK:
13	Pass the witness.
14	EXAMINATION
15	BY MS. LAWSON:
16	Q. Professor, do you have any idea how
17	Dr. Michel came to find the particular
18	research assistants he was using at the
19	University of Florida?
20	A. I have no idea.
21	Q. Do you know if it was known to
22	anyone in the administration at the
23	University of Florida that these particular
24	research assistants were working with Dr.
25	Michel?
1	A. Do I have knowledge of what the
2	administration knew?
3	Q. I'm asking if you know.
4	A. No. I have no knowledge about any
5	of that.
6	Q. So you don't know that it was
7	unknown to the administration, do you?
8	A. Unknown? I have no way of knowing
9	either way.
10	Q. So you don't know and you can't say
11	that these research assistants were working
12	in secret, can you?
13	A. No. And I didn't say that. That's
14	something that Dr. Proctor says.
15	Q. And that's something that counsel
16	questioned you about, right?
17	A. Right.
18	Q. Do you know if these research
19	assistants violated any rules applying to
20	graduate students at the university of
21	Florida in doing their work for Dr. Michel?
22	A. I have no knowledge of that in any
2	3	way.
24	Q. So you can't say that they did?
25	A. No.
1	Q. Do you believe these research
2	assistants did anything criminal?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Do you believe they did anything
5	inappropriate?
6	A. No.
7	MS. LAWSON:
8	I think that's all I have.
9	MR. OGLE:
10	No questions, for the record.
11	MR. HENK:
12	I just have for the record, just for
13	the record, bottom line is, I did the best I
14	could examining Dr. Kyriakoudes today on
15	Exhibits 9 and 10, given that they were just
16	produced today. So that's obviously -- the
17	questioning was without waiving any
18	additional rights that my client may have to
19	examine Dr. Kyriakoudes about Exhibits 9 and
20	10.
21	MR. OGLE:
22	I think -- for the record, I think
23	you did an excellent and complete
24	examination. I don't think you could have
25	done any better.
1	MS. LAWSON:
2	And I'll say the same thing for
3	Reynolds.
4	VIDEO REPORTER:
5	This concludes the video recorded
6	deposition of Dr. Louis Kyriakoudes,
7	consisting of six videotapes. The time is
8	7:49 and we're off the record.
