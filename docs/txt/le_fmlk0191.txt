1	EXAMINATION
2	BY MS. CASE:
3	Q. Good morning, professor.
4	A. Good morning.
5	Q. We've met several times before; is
6	that right?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. And you've been deposed many times?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And so you understand that you must
11	give verbal answers to my questions.
12	A. Yes. I understand that.
13	Q. Okay. And you understand we can't
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	interrupt each other while we're conducting
15	this deposition. You understand that?
16	A. I understand that.
17	Q. And do you also understand that you
18	must answer the questions that I ask?
19	A. Well, I'll do my best.
20	Q. That's fair enough. And you
21	understand that this videotaped deposition
22	may be used at trial?
23	A. That's right. That's why you are
24	filming it.
25	Q. Good. You are an expert. I know
7
1	you know.
2	Now, we've got a lot to cover today,
3	so if I ask you a question that may be
4	fairly answered yes or no, will you give me
5	a yes or no answer?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And, similarly, if I ask you a
8	question that requires a more detailed
9	answer, you will give me a more detailed
10	answer?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Now, you understand you've just been
13	sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth and
14	nothing but the truth. Do you understand
15	that?
16	A. That's right.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	Q. And do you have any questions about
18	what that means?
19	A. No.
20	Q. So if I ask you a question that
21	you've answered untruthfully in a prior
22	deposition, you will give me a truthful
23	answer today?
24	MR. QUINN:
25	Object to the form.
8
1	A. I have not answered questions
2	untruthfully in prior depositions, but I
3	will continue to, as I've always done,
4	answer truthfully in this deposition, of
5	course.
6	MS. CASE:
7	Q. And you will tell me the whole
8	truth?
9	MR. QUINN:
10	Object to the form.
11	A. I will answer truthfully, yes.
12	MS. CASE:
13	Q. Answer truthfully including giving
14	the whole entire truth?
15	A. Yes. That's what the -- what I said
16	I would do just a moment ago.
17	Q. And you understand that every time
18	you are under oath in a deposition or at a
19	trial, you are sworn to give the truth, the
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	whole truth and nothing but the truth,
21	correct?
22	A. That's correct. I take that very
23	seriously.
24	Q. Are you taking any medications today
25	that might interfere with your ability to
9
1	give truthful testimony?
2	A. No.
3	Q. How about any medications that might
4	interfere with your memory?
5	A. No.
6	Q. Have you ever been diagnosed with a
7	memory problem?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Have you had any unusual memory
10	problems this summer?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Has anyone mentioned to you, a
13	family member, colleague that you seem to be
14	having trouble with your memory?
15	A. No.
16	Q. You are not represented by
17	plaintiffs counsel today; is that correct?
18	A. That's right. I'm here by myself.
19	Q. Mr. Quinn is not your lawyer?
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. Have you retained or consulted with
22	counsel privately in your -- on your own
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	behalf with regard to any matters you think
24	we might get into today?
25	A. To represent me?
10
1	Q. Correct.
2	A. No. I don't have an attorney.
3	Q. You understand that you are here
4	today to give testimony about the Hibner and
5	Humpal cases?
6	A. That's right.
7	Q. And are you prepared to do so at
8	this time?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. Do you have to do any additional
11	work before you are prepared to testify
12	about those two cases?
13	A. No.
14	MS. CASE:
15	I'm going to mark these 1 and 2,
16	please.
17	(Exhibits 1 and 2 were marked.)
18	MS. CASE:
19	Q. Professor, I've just handed you what
20	I've marked Exhibits 1 and 2 to your
21	deposition.
22	A. I see them.
23	Q. And 1 is your notice -- Amended
24	Notice of Taking Deposition in the Hibner
25	case; is that right?
1	A. Yes, uh-huh.
2	Q. And Exhibit 2 is the same for the
3	Humpal case, correct?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. I'm going to ask you to turn to Page
6	4 of Exhibit 1, Schedule A. Do you see
7	that?
8	A. Yes, I do.
9	Q. And it's also Page 4 of Exhibit 2?
10	A. I've got them both here.
11	Q. Have you seen these before?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And did you bring anything with you
14	today in response to the Schedule A,
15	Exhibits 1 or 2?
16	A. I did.
17	Q. Can you hand those things to me at
18	this time?
19	what you've just handed me is the
20	most recent copy of your CV?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. Is that right?
23	A. Uh-huh.
24	MS. CASE:
25	I'll mark that Exhibit 3.
1	(Exhibit 3 was marked.)
2	MS. CASE:
3	Q. Has this changed in any meaningful
4	way in the last month?
5	A. No. No.
6	Q. What else did you bring with you
7	today?
8	A. I had acquired, through my research,
9	some more television advertisements and
10	other documents, so I just burned them to a
11	disk. And I can give you that or maybe the
12	court reporter can return it to me after
13	you've copied it and I can send it onto you,
14	however you want to do that.
15	Q. You've just handed me a CD. it has
16	your name at the top, and at the bottom, it
17	says, sup. reliance, Humpal/Hibner?
18	A. That's right.
19	Q. Can you tell me basically what's on
20	the disk?
21	A. what's on the disk is a folder
22	called Commercials that has video
23	commercials for cigarette products. There
24	is a sheet of paper within that file that
25	also has links to video commercials, and an
13
1	on-line database through the Legacy
2	database, rather than use up a lot of memory
3	space. Then, in one of the items here, it
Page 11
4	was asked for me to send -- I forget the
5	language, but anything that I had sent Mr.
6	Quinn, and so I included those materials in
7	there, as wel1.
8	Q. Can you tell me what those are?
9	A. Yes. I sent him a copy of my
10	standard generic expert report, and there is
11	a copy of a newspaper article from The New
12	York Times in 2002 or 2003 called History
13	For Hi re.
14	Q. Okay. Can you tell me why you sent
15	those to Mr. Quinn?
16	A. We had not had much of a
17	conversation. He was interested in my
18	opinions related to tobacco, generally, and
19	I said, the best way is to read this generic
20	expert report that I've composed. It is an
21	introduction to what I do and how I do it
22	and my opinions. It's something that I've
23	produced to the defense many times. So it's
24	not -- it's unchanged from prior versions of
25	it that I've produced in the past.
14
1	Q. when did you send your, as you
2	called it, generic expert report to Mr.
3	Quinn?
4	A. Probably about two weeks ago. Yeah,
5	two weeks ago.
6	Q. Was that your first contact with Mr.
Page 12
7	Quinn?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Was that the first you had heard of
10	the Hibner or Humpal cases?
11	A. No. Prior to that, I had dealt with
12	a secretary in his lawyer's office.
13	Q. When was that?
14	A. Earlier. I think I got materials
15	related to this case back when I was deposed
16	for the Koballa case and I actually had some
17	confusion at the Koballa deposition as to
18	what was the course of things to be
19	discussed at that particular deposition, so
20	they sent me materials at that time.
21	Q. At the time of your Koballa
22	deposition on August 24th or at the same
23	time you were sent Koballa materials prior
24	to that deposition?
25	A. Prior to that deposition.
15
1	Q. Can you give me your best
2	recollection of when that was?
3	A. it was just before that.
4	Q. So it wasn't months before that; it
5	was a matter of days?
6	A. Days. Yeah, days.
7	Q. So days before the Koballa
8	deposition was the first time you had seen
9	materials for Koballa, Louis, Hibner or
Page 13
10	Humpal?
11	A. Yes. And this paralegal, Tammy
12	Todd, had sent materials after that, as
13	well, in this month, as well. And
14	basically, since you are going to ask, those
15	materials are the depositions of essentially
16	the family members involved in both of those
17	cases and the interrogatories.
18	Q. And those are not on this disk that
19	you produced?
20	A. No. You have those already, so I
21	didn't see a need to burn copies.
22	Q. Okay. Is there anything -- and
23	we'll go through and list what exactly you
24	have reviewed for this case, is there
25	anything else that you have in your
16
1	possession that's responsive to any of the
2	requests in Schedule A of Exhibits 1 or 2
3	that you haven't produced at this time?
4	A. Well, I've got a couple of other
5	documents that I want to add to my reliance
6	list. So I brought this book which I've had
7	in my possession. This is my only copy and
8	I don't have a photocopy of it, so I do want
9	this back, is that possible?
10	This is an advertising publication,
11	I guess you would call it. So this --
12	Q. Let me take a look at that.
Page 14
13	A. And I brought another artifact. I
14	have two artifacts. I have this artifact,
15	which is a historical artifact. And this,
16	also, I would need back, is that possible?
17	Q. Could you just describe for me the
18	red box that you have?
19	A. This box is a package of Blosser's
20	cigarettes.
21	Q. what are Blosser's cigarettes?
22	A. They're a medical cigarette that was
23	sold in the first half of the 20th Century.
24	Q. And why did you bring that with you
25	today?
17
1	A. It might be something I would want
2	to use at the trial, so I just wanted to
3	identify it to you.
4	Q. Why might you want to use it at the
5	trial?
6	A. Well, depending upon how much of the
7	history that we get into on the direct
8	examination, we may want to talk about the
9	tradition of medical cigarettes, which are a
10	part of the rise of smoking, generally. And
11	Blosser's is an example of a popular medical
12	cigarette.
13	Q. And I just said "the trial." You
14	know, we're here today to talk about two
15	cases, so if I don't specify one or the
Page 15
16	other, will you assume I'm talking about
17	both Humpal and Hibner?
18	A. Yes. And I'll follow the same
19	practice. So just now, what I said applied
20	to both.
21	Q. And could you just describe for me
22	the other item that you brought?
23	A. Yes. This is a book entitled,
24	"Breakthrough! MERIT Presents
25	History-Changing Achievements, 1851 to 1978,
18
1	as reported by the New York Times." And
2	it's published -- it's published by Philip
3	Morris, Incorporated, for Merit Kings and
4	100s. And I know it came out at the time
5	that the Merit brand was introduced in the
6	late '70s, but it doesn't have an actual
7	date inside of it.
8	Q. Why did you bring that with you
9	today?
10	A. it's an example of materials related
11	to the Merit cigarette and, in this case,
12	Merit is one of the brands smoked. So I
13	have this in my personal collection and I
14	brought it with me as an artifact.
15	(Off the record.)
16	MS. CASE:
17	Q. Professor, we were talking about the
18	Schedule A to Exhibits 1 and 2. Is it your
Page 16
19	practice to review schedule A attached to
20	your Notice of Deposition prior to appearing
21	for the deposition?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And you do that regularly in all the
24	cases in which you are deposed?
25	A. Yes.
19
1	Q. Just to finish up with Exhibits 1
2	and 2, other than the two items you
3	mentioned that are on the CD that you
4	provided in terms of your communications
5	with Mr. Quinn, have you had any other
6	communications by e-mail or in any written
7	form with anyone from -- anyone representing
8	the plaintiff?
9	A. Including, like, the secretary about
10	scheduling?
11	Q. Yes.
12	A. Yes. I have scheduling memos from
13	-- you know, telling me what time to be here
14	and when am I available with Tammy Todd, the
15	secretary. I did not bring those.
16	And I have one communication with
17	Mr. Quinn which I did not bring.
18	Q. what is the content of that
19	communication that you did not bring?
20	A. Well, that's a privileged
21	communication so I did not bring that.
Page 17
22	Q. You understand that Mr. Quinn is not
23	your lawyer, correct?
24	A. Right. But in discussing the
25	communication with him, he identified it as
20
1	a privileged item, where we discussed trial
2	strategy and not to bring that.
3	Q. You were discussing trial strategy
4	with Mr. Quinn?
5	A. In an e-mail, yes.
6	Q. And the e-mail, what is the date on
7	it?
8	A. The exact date, it's been within the
9	last ten days. Probably about ten days ago.
10	Q. And who initiated the communication?
11	A. I did.
12	Q. What did you write in your e-mail to
13	Mr. Quinn?
14	MR. QUINN:
15	Object.
16	A. Well, I discussed aspects of the
17	trial, from a strategic perspective, related
18	to my testimony.
19	MS. CASE:
20	Q. Please tell me the content of that
21	communication.
22	MR. QUINN:
23	Object. He said it was privileged.
24	A. I said it was privileged. I'm not
Page 18
25	going to answer that.
1	MS. CASE:
2	Q. Are you an attorney, sir?
3	A. No. But we -- we discussed this
4	e-mail, if there's a problem with it, if
5	the judge wants me to turn it over, I'll
6	happily, of course, do so.
7	Q. When you initiated this particular
8	e-mail communication, did you believe you
9	were engaging in attorney strategy sessions
10	with Mr. Quinn?
11	A. Well, I didn't say attorney
12	strategy. They were trial strategy
13	discussion related to my testimony. Yes, I
14	did.
15	Q. So you were intending to advise Mr.
16	Quinn on how he should proceed at trial with
17	regard to your testimony?
18	A. Yes. That would be fair, or how to
19	proceed with my testimony, yes.
20	Q. And how to proceed with your
21	testimony so as to best maximize the chance
22	that the plaintiff will prevail at trial?
23	MR. QUINN:
24	Object to the form.
25	A. No. To -- so that he understands my
1	opinions. He's coming from a position of,
2	my perception, of not having ever done a
3	tobacco case before, and not as
4	knowledgeable as some of the other attorneys
5	of some factual materials, so I offered him
6	just some basic discussion related to that.
7	MS. CASE:
8	Q. So you weren't advising him on trial
9	strategy on how to lose a trial, were you?
10	A. No, I wasn't advising him how to
11	lose or how to win, simply related to my
12	testimony, me, personally.
13	Q. And you understand that Mr. Quinn
14	wants to use your testimony to prevail at
15	trial?
16	A. Well, I know that that's what he
17	wants to do. That's right.
18	Q. And you were telling him how to best
19	use your testimony to do so?
20	MR. QUINN:
21	Objection.
22	A. No. That's not exactly how it was
23	phrased.
24	MS. CASE:
25	Q. It doesn't matter to you one way or
1	the other?
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	A. Well, I've been asked this question.
3	I was asked this question in the Barbanell
4	testimony and you can refer back to that
5	previous answer. In fact, it might have
6	been you that asked me the question. No, it
7	wasn't. It was the other attorney, Jenny
8	Brown, and you can refer to it. I went into
9	great detail and you can refer to that
10	previous answer.
11	Q. Please provide the answer. I don't
12	believe we had the videotape of that
13	deposition, and Barbanell is in Broward
14	County. These cases are in Volusia County.
15	Please provide an answer.
16	A. Oh, sure. I can summarize it for
17	you.
18	MS. CASE:
19	Could you read the question back for
20	him?
21	COURT REPORTER:
22	"It doesn't matter to you one way or
23	the other?"
24	A. That's right. I'm not an advocate
25	in this litigation. I'm simply here to bear
24
1	witness to the truth, as I understand it,
2	using the methods and materials normally
3	used in my profession as a historian.
4	MS. CASE:
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	Q. And you are choosing to withhold an
6	e-mail because you were providing what you
7	are deeming attorney privileged
8	communication with Mr. Quinn, plaintiffs'
9	counsel?
10	A. That's correct.
11	Q. Has Mr. Quinn responded to that
12	e-mail?
13	A. He did.
14	Q. When did he respond?
15	A. Shortly thereafter, and within a day
16	or two.
17	Q. What was the content of his
18	response?
19	A. A response to my first e-mail. I
20	mean, I hate to be vague about that, but if
21	I was going to give you the e-mail, you
22	know, you would have all that in front of
23	you, but to answer these questions would
24	essentially require me to tell you
25	everything that was in this e-mail strategy.
25
1	Q. You are currently refusing to
2	produce your communications with plaintiffs
3	counsel as they relate to both of these
4	cases; is that what you are telling me?
5	A. Yes. One set of communications.
6	That's right.
7	Q. One set of communications. So we've
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	already talked about the e-mail from you to
9	Mr. Quinn discussing trial strategy,
10	correct?
11	A. Yes, broadly, yes.
12	Q. And then there was his response.
13	Was that also discussing trial strategy?
14	A. it was in response to some issues
15	that I had raised, yes.
16	Q. So it was discussing trial strategy?
17	A. Yes, testimony strategy related to
18	me, related to my testimony.
19	Q. How to present your testimony in the
20	best way for him at trial?
21	A. No. I wouldn't describe it that
22	way.
23	Q. How would you describe it?
24	A. I'm not going to, if it was
25	privileged, if I described it, then there
26
1	would be no point.
2	Q. Are you, personally, refusing to
3	produce these or are you refusing to produce
4	them at the direction of plaintiff's
5	counsel?
6	A. Well, I'm not sure on this one.
7	MR. QUINN:
8	Well, let me speak to that. Yes.
9	He is —
10	MS. CASE:
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	Please let the witness answer the
12	question, and then if you want to add
13	something, go ahead.
14	MR. QUINN:
15	Go ahead. Answer the question.
16	A. I'm not sure.
17	MS. CASE:
18	Q. You are not sure if you are refusing
19	to produce them or if you are refusing to
20	produce them at Mr. Quinn's direction?
21	A. Well, I'll say this, in my
22	discussions with Mr. Quinn about the
23	communications, we agreed that this set of
24	communications reflected what he described
25	as privileged material related to the trial,
27
1	and so therefore -- basically, the answer
2	would be that I'm not producing it because
3	he's mounted objections on that.
4	MR. QUINN:
5	And, now, let me speak to that
6	objection. The Florida rule on experts says
7	that if you believe something is privileged
8	that you have the right not to produce it,
9	if we believe -- I believe it is privileged.
10	I believe that those two
11	communications are privileged. They deal
12	with trial. And I told him that it was a
13	privilege.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	Under the rule, once we do that,
15	what we are required to tell you, is to
16	identify it for you, which he has done. You
17	may now seek, through the court, the
18	opportunity to test me as to whether it's
19	privileged or not. But there's no need
20	going into it anymore because he's not going
21	to tell you what it was.
22	MS. CASE:
23	I understand. I'm still going to go
24	into it a little beyond that.
25	Q. With that statement, after you sent
28
1	an e-mail to Mr. Quinn and Mr. Quinn
2	responded to you, were there any further
3	e-mail communications?
4	A. No.
5	Q. You were questioned in the Gray
6	deposition about a document that had been
7	sent to you that you had believed was
8	attorney work product. Do you recall that?
9	A. Gray deposition? which one was
10	that?
11	Q. Gray would have been on September
12	1st. Plaintiff's counsel is Matt Schultz.
13	Do you remember that?
14	A. okay. I remember that deposition.
15	Q. You had been sent, I believe by a
16	paralegal in Mr. Schultz' office, a document
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	discussing trial strategy that you deemed
18	attorney work product. Do you remember
19	that?
20	A. Are you getting that confused with
21	the Koballa case?
22	Q. Perhaps.
23	A. Because in the Koballa case, just to
24	help you out here, I was sent, what I
25	believe was in error, a document which when
29
1	I opened it, it was clearly like a game
2	plan, if you will. And I thought, I don't
3	want to see this, and I closed it. And I
4	sent an e-mail to the secretary that had
5	sent this saying that I believe you sent
6	this to me in error. Even I, with my
7	limited knowledge, understand that this is
8	what falls within the boundaries of
9	privileged communications and was not
10	something I needed to see. it was not
11	relevant in any way to my expertise or my
12	testimony, et cetera. So I think that might
13	be what you are talking about.
14	Q. I think you might be right. So when
15	you received that document from the
16	paralegal that you identified and recognized
17	as work product, you responded somewhat
18	harshly to the paralegal, saying that you
19	didn't want to receive this and you didn't
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	need it, you weren't supposed to be seeing
21	privileged communications. Do you recall
22	that?
23	A. Yes. That had no business or no
24	relevance to my testimony or my role in the
25	tri al.
30
1	Q. And so, certainly, you wouldn't
2	initiate a communication with plaintiff's
3	counsel that you intended to be work product
4	privileged; is that right?
5	A. Well, no, that's not right. Those
6	two things have nothing to do with each
7	other. I mean, if you are trying to link
8	this Koballa incident in where I was sent
9	clearly, in error, materials that are only
10	relevant to, say, for example, the attorney
11	who is trying the case and his assistants,
12	to something that directly relates to my
13	testimony, which I discussed with Mr. Quinn,
14	those are two completely separate and
15	unrelated types of communication.
16	Q. Well, you've been involved in
17	litigation for quite some time, correct?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. And you believe you can recognize
20	attorney work product when you see it,
21	correct?
22	A. Yes. When it so clearly screams
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	that, as in the case of the one that we just
24	described.
25	Q. So do you, personally, consider the
31
1	e-mail that you wrote to Mr. Quinn to be
2	attorney work product?
3	A. Me, personally?
4	Q. Yes.
5	A. Well, I'm not qualified. You know,
6	I'm not an attorney. You know, he's making
7	the objection.
8	Q. I'm not asking you. He made his
9	position quite clear.
10	A. Yeah.
11	Q. I'm asking you what you believe with
12	regard to that e-mail.
13	MR. QUINN:
14	Well, I'm going to object. And my
15	objection is based on the fact that he's
16	already told you it's my objection. It's
17	not his. Therefore, he doesn't have to
18	explain my reasons. If you want to know my
19	reasons, you can ask me for my reasons.
20	MS. CASE:
21	I want to know his understanding of
22	the communication.
23	MR. QUINN:
24	Well, he was instructed not to
25	present it. That's the end of the
32
1	discussion.
2	MS. CASE:
3	That's not the end of the
4	discussion, as far as I'm concerned. In
5	order to move forward with seeking these
6	communications, we'll need as specific
7	information about them as we can get.
8	MR. QUINN:
9	You have that.
10	MS. CASE:
11	So that's what I'm getting.
12	MR. QUINN:
13	No. You already have that. You are
14	going beyond that. You already have the
15	fact that there are two e-mails within the
16	last ten days, one from him, one from me. I
17	know exactly where they are. I know exactly
18	how to produce them to you.
19	Once you are able to show me that
20	they're not work product, I'll give them to
21	you. Now, let's move on.
22	MS. CASE:
23	Q. When you drafted that e-mail to Mr.
24	Quinn, did you believe you were creating a
25	work product document?
33
1	MR. QUINN:
2	Object. Asked and answered. You
3	don't have to answer the same question over
4	and over again in this deposition.
5	THE WITNESS:
6	Okay.
7	MS. CASE:
8	Q. Are you refusing to answer?
9	A. No. I'll refer you to my prior
10	answer.
11	Q. I've asked the question, but you
12	haven't answered it. I can ask the question
13	as many times as necessary for you to
14	provide me with an answer to the question.
15	MR. QUINN:
16	Object to the form. That's
17	misleading.
18	A. I agree. I mean, I -- as I was
19	writing the letter, did I think this was
20	privileged? That word did not come into my
21	mind when I wrote it. Did I think it
22	related to how the trial might be conducted,
23	in terms of my testimony? Yes. I did
24	believe that it was a sensitive piece of
25	communication.
34
1	So, yes, I mean, it was a
2	substantive communication about matters
3	related to my testimony that I intended for
Page 30
4	only the attorney, Mr. Quinn, to see. That
5	was in my mind when I wrote it. Whether
6	that's privileged or not, you know, I'm not
7	an attorney, so I didn't hold it up against
8	a standard, a legal standard in my mind.
9	Q. Do you intend to testify at trial in
10	the Hibner case?
11	A. I intend to. Yes. I intend to
12	testify. Live, you mean?
13	Q. Yes.
14	A. Yes. I do intend, in both cases, to
15	be there in person.
16	Q. In Humpal, as well?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And when you drafted the e-mail to
19	Mr. Quinn, was it your intention to testify
20	live, as a witness, at the Humpal and Hibner
21	trials?
22	A. Yes. My intention has been to
23	appear in person, yes.
24	Q. So at the time you drafted that
25	e-mail, you weren't under some understanding
35
1	that you were only a consulting expert that
2	would not be called to testify at trial?
3	A. That's correct. Yes.
4	Q. Going back to Exhibits 1 and 2,
5	aside from the documents you've already
6	handed me and the documents that Mr. Quinn
Page 31
7	has instructed you not to produce, is there
8	anything else that you have in your
9	possession that is responsive to any of the
10	requests in Schedule A?
11	A. Well, I was sent a formal objection
12	that was filed with the court to some of
13	these items by Mr. Quinn or maybe his
14	secretary. I forget. And I haven't brought
15	things that they've objected to.
16	Q. What haven't you brought that's
17	responsive to these requests?
18	A. Well, Item 16 and 17, I haven't
19	brought anything relevant to that.
20	Q. Do you have anything in your
21	possession relevant to 16 or 17?
22	A. Yes, I do.
23	Q. Tell me what you have that's
24	relevant to Request Number 16.
25	A. Well, the way Number 16 is worded,
36
1	it asks for any communications that I've had
2	with Robert Proctor of any -- I interpret
3	that to mean of any type, even stuff not
4	related to litigation, even personal
5	matters. And I do have things related to
6	other research projects that I've done. I
7	have materials related to that in my file.
8	But as the objection says, it bears
9	no relevance to this case, so I did not
Page 32
10	bring them.
11	Q. Describe for me what you have in
12	your possession that you haven't brought
13	with you in response to 16.
14	A. E-mails related to organizing a
15	session at the History of Science Society,
16	e-mails related to a personal nature, you
17	know, with Mr. Proctor.
18	Q. And you have a personal relationship
19	with Dr. Proctor?
20	A. A friendly relationship, yes. We're
21	colleagues. Yes.
22	Q. And what sort of personal matters
23	would you be discussing with Dr. Proctor?
24	A. You know, just friendship matters.
25	I mean, nothing like, you know, bearing
37
1	one's soul, it's nothing like that. Just
2	friendship e-mails, just like anyone would
3	send an e-mail to a friend, where you have a
4	common research and professional
5	identification, as he and I do, as we're
6	both historians of the cigarette industry
7	and smoking and health, generally, in
8	American life, and indeed, globally.
9	Q. Do you remember what my question
10	was?
11	A. Yes. You asked for a description of
12	things of a personal nature and I gave you
Page 33
13	the answer.
14	Q. And what you described as being
15	personal in nature largely related to your
16	commonality of being historians of the
17	cigarette industry. You consider those
18	communications to be personal?
19	A. Well, there's personal information
20	in those communications. I mean, we're
21	colleagues and friends.
22	Q. And there's information regarding
23	your roles as cigarette historians; is that
24	right?
25	A. Yes.
38
1	Q. And so you have in your possession
2	e-mails with Robert Proctor that relate to
3	your role as cigarette historians that also
4	contain personal information and you haven't
5	brought those with you today?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. Can you describe for me or can you
8	give me an idea of how many e-mails we're
9	talking about that have sort of that hybrid
10	character, that have some --
11	A. I haven't counted them, so I can't.
12	I mean, I haven't counted them.
13	Q. Over what time period have these
14	occurred?
15	A. Well, in my possession, I have
Page 34
16	e-mails from probably the last year. That's
17	about how far back my e-mails go.
18	Q. And you delete e-mails older than a
19	year; is that --
20	A. Well, when you change computers, you
21	often lose your e-mail. That's right.
22	Q. Did you change computers a year ago?
23	A. I changed e-mail systems.
24	Q. Is that when you went to the GMail?
25	A. I went to GMail. I also, at a point
39
1	in time, after I had adopted the use of
2	GMail, I had actually downloaded GMail. I
3	was kind of learning how to use the program.
4	And downloaded the e-mails onto an older
5	computer and don't have those in my
6	possession.
7	Q. Where is the older computer?
8	A. Probably in the trash. I mean, it
9	was a broken -- when I turned it into the
10	university, it was broken. The screen came
11	off. it was a laptop. The hinges broke. I
12	think they junked it.
13	Q. And do you recall when it was that
14	you got the new computer?
15	A. I got the new computer, I believe,
16	in 2008.
17	Q. Can you be more specific? was it at
18	the beginning of the school year? was it at
Page 35
19	the end of the school year?
20	A. Oh, yes. I would have gotten it --
21	when did I upgrade? it would have either
22	been in the fall of 2007 or the spring of
23	2008, sometime in that school year, the
24	'07/'08 school year.
25	Q. So do you have in your possession
40
1	all of your e-mails that you've sent or
2	received since the time you upgraded
3	computers during the '07/'08 school year?
4	A. No. No. I delete e-mails. I
5	answered this question, again. I believe it
6	was Mr. Henk asked me this question in the
7	Koballa deposition.
8	And I periodically go through and
9	delete e-mails. I don't have an automatic
10	deletion, but I do -- it gets to be too
11	many, and so I'll go through and just kind
12	of delete whole qualities -- or whole areas
13	of e-mails that I don't need anymore for my
14	work.
15	Q. Have you deleted e-mails from Robert
16	Proctor?
17	A. I'm sure I have, yes. I
18	periodically go through, I do mass deletes.
19	I'm sure I have, yes.
20	Q. Have you deleted e-mails that you've
21	sent to Robert Proctor?
22	A. Well, with GMail, you can delete the
23	whole conversation. You get rid of the
24	whole thing. So that includes send and
25	receive.
41
1	Q. So that's a yes?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. I don't think you gave me an idea of
4	even roughly how many e-mails we're talking
5	about between you and Robert Proctor that
6	you don't feel that you need to produce, is
7	it five? is it ten? is it a hundred? what
8	is your best estimate of how many e-mails
9	you decided not to bring today?
10	A. Well, the way I interpret Number 16,
11	it's every e-mail between me and Robert
12	Proctor.
13	Q. That's a good way to interpret it.
14	A. And, you know, I've probably
15	communicated with Robert a couple of times,
16	maybe three times a month, on average,
17	sometimes more, sometimes less, over the
18	time that I've known him, certainly at the
19	times that I've been on this e-mail system.
20	So you do the math on that. Maybe 26 or 40
21	e-mails a year, maybe more or less. I
22	haven't gone through and counted them. I
23	mean, would have to go back and do
24	inventory, which I've not done that.
Page 37
LKyriakoudes 10012009
25	Q. So it would be fair to say that
1	there are dozens of e-mails that you have
2	with Robert Proctor that you haven't brought
3	with you today in response to Exhibit 16?
4	A. Dozens, yes.
5	Q. Do you have any e-mails between you
6	and Robert Proctor that you haven't produced
7	to the defendants previously that relate
8	specifically to the situation with Betty
9	Smocovitis at the university of Florida?
10	A. No. I've given you everything on
11	that.
12	Q. You are sure?
13	A. Yep.
14	Q. Positive?
15	A. Positive, everything I have.
16	Q. And there's nothing else?
17	A. Nothing else.
18	Q. Other than the dozens of e-mails
19	that you are not producing at this time?
20	A. Well, that's a different category.
21	Now we're talking about the ones related
22	to—
23	Q. Cigarette litigation, generally?
24	A. Oh, well, now you are talking --
25	that's different than -- cigarette
43
1	litigation is a different category than
2	being a historian of the tobacco industry
3	and smoking and American life.
4	Q. You separate those two?
5	A. I do, absolutely.
6	Q. But you have e-mails related to your
7	work as a -- your research as a historian of
8	the cigarette industry with Dr. Proctor that
9	you are not producing at this time?
10	A. That's correct, yes.
11	Q. Anything else in response to 16 that
12	you have that you are not producing?
13	A. No. what you just described. But
14	just to clarify, when you asked about
15	materials related to this business with the
16	University of Florida, I did produce the
17	forwarded e-mails to you and the forwarding
18	e-mail which I sent a deposition to Mr.
19	Proctor, which is referred to in prior
20	testimony.
21	Q. How about Number 17?
22	A. Well, this is broad. I mean, very
23	broad.
24	Q. I thought you weren't a lawyer, sir.
25	MR. QUINN:
44
1	Object to the form, argumentative.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	A. No. I'm not a lawyer, but I can
3	read English. I am literate. And so in
4	that capacity, as a person who has the
5	ability to read and understand English, I
6	make a reasonable judgment that this is a
7	very broad response and I'm not bringing
8	anything responsive to this.
9	MS. CASE:
10	Q. You are personally deciding not to
11	bring anything responsive to 17?
12	A. Yes. That would be me, as well.
13	Q. Mr. Quinn hasn't directed you not to
14	bring anything responsive? That is your
15	personal decision?
16	A. That's right. I personally object,
17	in the capacity of myself, if that's
18	possible. I don't know if it is. But this
19	requires a fishing expedition into matters
20	that are completely unrelated to this
21	particular set of cases.
22	Q. I'll just read 17. It says, "All
23	correspondence or communications, including
24	e-mails, text messages and faxes between you
25	or your assistants and any person or entity
45
1	relating in any way to smoking and health
2	litigation."
3	You understand that we're here today
4	in a smoking and health case. Two,
5	actually.
6	A. Yes. I also understand I'm here in
7	my capacity as an expert witness, and the
8	purpose of this deposition is for you to
9	inquire of me what I know and what I'm
10	likely to testify and the materials that I'm
11	going to rely upon to give my expert
12	testimony in this case. That, of course,
13	I'll happily provide to you.
14	But this attempt at fishing -- in
15	fact, I wouldn't even call it fishing. I
16	would call it cast netting. I'm not going
17	to bring anything responsive to that.
18	Q. So you have documents in your
19	possession related to smoking and health
20	litigation that you are refusing to produce
21	in response to Number 17?
22	A. Yes, many documents that deal with
23	issues not even related to your client or
24	any client represented in this room.
25	Q. How about specifically
46
1	communications with any counsel representing
2	plaintiffs in the Hibner and Humpal cases?
3	MR. QUINN:
4	Objection, asked and answered.
5	MS. CASE:
6	Q. Other than the two we've discussed,
7	are there additional e-mails, text messages,
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	anything with counsel for the Hibner and
9	Humpal plaintiffs?
10	A. No.
11	Q. Are there specific documents that
12	you are thinking of that you don't want to
13	produce in response to Number 17?
14	A. No. I'm not thinking of any
15	particular documents. I mean, this -- I
16	mean, this is just so broad. The way I
17	interpret this, to satisfy it, would have to
18	--I'd just give you my computer, and you
19	can come through my office and poke around
20	and, you know, spend a few days taking
21	whatever you want. I mean, that's how I
22	interpret that.
23	To me, it's very broad. And it
24	deals with matters, again, that would
25	require you to have access to matters that
47
1	have nothing to do with your client or Mr.
2	Henk's client; for that matter, anything
3	even happening in the United States, it
4	would give you access to things that would
5	involve international issues, which have no
6	bearing on anything related to any issue
7	that would come up in Volusia County
8	litigation, Engle progeny litigation or any
9	litigation that I anticipate coming out of
10	this deposition.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	Q. All right. Let's limit it to Engle
12	progeny litigation, with that caveat, do
13	you have any documents in your possession
14	responsive to Number 17, Engle progeny cases
15	in Florida, specifically?
16	MR. QUINN:
17	That you haven't already produced.
18	A. Well, you can go back to all my
19	prior depositions in the cases and follow up
20	on a discussion of that. I have delivered
21	many e-mails. Like in the Koballa
22	deposition, I think I handed over a whole
23	bunch of e-mails.
24	MS. CASE:
25	Q. Let's eliminate documents that
48
1	you've already produced at some point to
2	defense counsel in Engle progeny litigation.
3	Do you have other documents, communications,
4	e-mails, text messages, things that you
5	haven't yet identified that you can do at
6	this time?
7	A. Well, I have materials relating to
8	cases that are happening in the future for
9	which there has been no Notice of
10	Deposition, and to which I have consulted
11	with attorneys and have not, as of yet, made
12	a decision as to whether I would or would
13	not appear in person, so that category of
14	materials.
15	And when those cases come to a
16	position where there is a deposition notice
17	and you have the opportunity to request that
18	correspondence, I'll respond to those
19	requests at that time.
20	Q. Aside from cases where you've been
21	asked to consult and you haven't yet been
22	named or noticed for deposition, how about
23	anything beyond that?
24	A. No, nothing beyond that.
25	Q. How about anything in relation to
49
1	Engle progeny litigation generally? You've
2	discussed an e-mail that you sent to Mr.
3	Quinn, that work product privilege has been
4	alleged on that. Have you sent other
5	e-mails to plaintiffs' counsel representing
6	perspective Engle plaintiffs regarding
7	strategy, anything along those lines?
8	A. Well, again, I refer back to my
9	previous answer. There are -- up to this
10	point in time, everything in which there has
11	been a deposition notice, and I've produced
12	or discussed those documents. There are, in
13	my files, correspondence relating to future
14	cases, which I don't know their status in
15	the courts, but from my perspective, I've
16	not been asked to schedule a deposition.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	You know, I've explained my opinions and
18	things like that. So I do have some
19	documents related to that. And when those
20	come up, I'll produce those.
21	Q. Fair enough, we were talking a
22	little bit before about Dr. Proctor. You
23	described him as your friend; is that
24	correct?
25	A. Yes. We're colleagues and friends.
50
1	Q. And you've worked with him both
2	inside and outside the judicial process in
3	matters relating to your testimony in
4	tobacco litigation?
5	A. Well, that's not quite accurate.
6	I've never worked with him as an expert
7	witness. I mean, we've never collaborated
8	as experts. You know, he does his
9	testimony. My testimony is different than
10	his, covers different areas.
11	But, professionally, as historians,
12	we have worked together, that's true.
13	Q. And you've also collaborated on
14	articles; is that right?
15	A. Well, again, that's not quite right.
16	We have not coauthored any articles, we
17	worked together to compile one table. He
18	wrote an article. I wrote an article as
19	part of a larger research project. When you
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	say "collaborate on an article," in
21	academia, that usually means co-authorship,
22	so that's just maybe a little bit more
23	precise than you probably meant it in your
24	mind.
25	Q. It sounds like you are parsing words
51
1	wi th me.
2	A. No.
3	Q. The two of you collaborated on a
4	table, you worked together on a table that
5	was published in an article that I believe
6	he authored and you authored, is that the
7	same table?
8	A. Yes. Right. But the two articles
9	were separate, we did work together on a
10	larger research project, though.
11	Q. So you worked together on a larger
12	research project that resulted in each of
13	you writing articles about historians who
14	testified for defendants in cigarette
15	litigation?
16	A. That's right.
17	Q. So you both worked together on that
18	project?
19	A. Yes. We each had different
20	assignments, yes.
21	Q. And you worked together to compile
22	the table listing defense historians; is
23	that true?
24	A. That's right.
25	Q. And did you consider that to be
52
1	related to the testimony that you gave in
2	cigarette litigation?
3	A. Related to the testimony? I mean,
4	to the extent that it covers the subject of
5	litigation, it's related, yes.
6	Q. And in that table that you
7	collaborated with Dr. Proctor on, you
8	identified not only testifying experts for
9	defendants in cigarette litigation, but also
10	consulting experts, correct?
11	A. Yes. That's right.
12	Q. And you understand the difference
13	between testifying and consulting experts,
14	correct?
15	A. Well, to the extent that consultants
16	consult and don't intend to testify, advise,
17	you know, yes, that's the difference. I
18	understand.
19	Q. And do you understand that work with
20	consulting experts is privileged attorney
21	work product?
22	A. That sounds reasonable, sure.
23	Q. And you, nevertheless, identified
24	consulting experts in this article that you
25	wrote?
53
1	A. That's right. I drew upon
2	historical documents that were -- well, they
3	were subpoenaed by the United States
4	Congress. I'm not an expert in all of the
5	legal maneuverings that happened, but my
6	understanding is that some of these claims
7	of privilege went all the way up to the
8	Supreme Court and were lost. And these
9	documents, therefore, are available to
10	scholars.
11	Q. And you understand those were
12	documents generated in relation to
13	litigation?
14	A. That's right. But I didn't use them
15	in a litigation environment. I used them in
16	a peer-reviewed scholarly environment.
17	Q. You used them. That was all that I
18	asked you, correct?
19	A. Right. In a peer-reviewed scholarly
20	study.
21	Q. And do you have any reason to
22	believe that any defendant intentionally
23	waived their work product privilege with
24	regard to those documents?
25	A. It makes no matter to me whatsoever.
54
1	I researched the documents that were in the
2	archive and reported on my findings in this
3	peer-reviewed study.
4	Q. You learned the names of these
5	consulting experts from what you understood
6	to be privileged industry documents?
7	A. Oh, well, at the time, when I was
8	researching that, I didn't think of them as
9	privileged or not. I just thought of them
10	as archival sources.
11	The privilege is an issue that, as
12	far as I'm concerned, applies only to legal
13	matters. This is historical matters. And
14	if a document or set of documents or an
15	archive is there, we're entitled to use that
16	as part of our research, and especially
17	access it through an on-line archive, such
18	as that maintained by the university of
19	California.
20	Q. I'm not asking you whether you were
21	entitled to use the documents or not. I'm
22	asking you whether you understood that you
23	were looking at documents that had been
24	generated by defendants' counsel and
25	intended to be cloaked under the privilege
55
1	of attorney/client.
2	A. Well, I did that research in 2004
3	and 2005.
4	Q. I didn't ask you when you did the
5	research.
6	A. Well, but I'm trying to answer your
7	question. And, you know, at that time, I
8	didn't think either way, whether they were
9	privileged or not. That was not something I
10	was thinking about.
11	So I guess to give you an answer is,
12	I didn't think about it. I didn't address
13	that issue over the course of my research.
14	It did not enter into my consideration as
15	using these historical documents for my
16	study.
17	So the answer would be, no, I didn't
18	understand them to be privileged at that
19	ti me.
20	Q. Do you agree that privilege is a
21	legitimate aspect of litigation and
22	necessary for both sides within this
23	process?
24	A. Oh, yes. For litigation, yes. Yes.
25	Now we're talking about litigation, yes.
56
1	Q. And you've invoked that privilege
2	today, correct, to avoid producing e-mails
3	that you have with plaintiffs' counsel?
4	A. That's correct, yes.
5	Q. You and Dr. Proctor have been
6	communicating for years with regard to your
Page 50
7	research on the cigarette industry, correct?
8	A. For the record, I don't appreciate
9	you using your fingers to make quotes when
10	you use the term "research" in terms of my
11	professional work. I find that demeaning.
12	Q. I apologize. I didn't --
13	A. Well, I appreciate the apology.
14	Thank you.
15	Q. I didn't know specifically how to
16	word it. So let me try —
17	A. it's research. Research would be an
18	adequate word for it.
19	Q. Okay. I'm asking specifically about
20	your article research. Maybe I didn't make
21	my question clear. You had parsed the words
22	about whether you were collaborating or not
23	collaborating, so that was still the vein
24	that I was talking about.
25	A. Okay.
57
1	Q. Okay. Do you understand?
2	A. Well, ask your question.
3	Q. Let me just start that over. You
4	have been communicating with Dr. Proctor for
5	many years about smoking and health
6	litigation; is that right?
7	A. About research on smoking and
8	health.
9	Q. So about research on smoking and
Page 51
10	health, you and Dr. Proctor have been
11	communicating for years?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Would you say that it's been roughly
14	three times a month for a period of years?
15	A. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I
16	mean, long periods of time will go by where
17	we have no reason to talk because we're not
18	doing any particular work, any particular
19	work that's in common. Then when we do have
20	some project, we'll talk a lot or e-mail a
21	lot.
22	Q. And your relationship with Dr.
23	Proctor began when?
24	A. We talked on the telephone beginning
25	in 2003. I was still in Chapel Hill then.
58
1	We didn't meet in person until we both
2	attended a conference in 2004.
3	Q. So since 2004, on average, three
4	times per month, you've communicated with
5	Dr. Proctor?
6	A. I'll refer to my previous answer.
7	Sometimes more, sometimes less.
8	Q. On average, that's your best
9	estimate?
10	A. Yes. A couple, maybe three.
11	Q. And have you communicated with Dr.
12	Proctor about -- obviously, you've
Page 52
13	communicated with Dr. Proctor about defense
14	historians testifying in cigarette
15	litigation.
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And you consider questions about the
18	public awareness of the risks of cigarette
19	smoking to be central to the tobacco
20	industry's defense of product liability
21	suits?
22	A. That was what I discovered in the
23	course of my research from the data project,
24	yes.
25	Q. And you believe that to be true?
59
1	A. Yes. I think that's true, if it's
2	central -- I don't know if it's central, but
3	certainly it's an important feature of the
4	litigation defense, as I understand it, from
5	reading the materials that I used for that
6	study.
7	Q. Do you recall describing it as
8	central in your article?
9	A. Maybe I used that word.
10	Q. In your tobacco control article?
11	A. is that the word I used?
12	Q. Yes.
13	A. Then I'll stick to that.
14	Q. You are not going to make me get it
15	out, are you?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Do you believe that your and Dr.
18	Proctor's articles could have the tendency
19	to dissuade professional historians from
20	working with counsel for tobacco companies?
21	A. Well, I don't think it has yet. I
22	mean, I think it -- there seems to be no
23	shortage of historians that you can draw
24	upon for consultation and for testimony. I
25	mean, there seem to be a fairly large number
60
1	of people that have worked with the
2	industry, so I don't think my article -- if
3	you use that as a test, it certainly hasn't
4	affected things for you.
5	Q. I asked you if you thought it could
6	dissuade professional historians from
7	working for counsel with the tobacco
8	industry.
9	A. No. No. I don't think so.
10	Q. You think it has no effect on
11	academic historians in any capacity?
12	A. Well, that's a different question.
13	No. I think it --
14	Q. It is a different question.
15	A. I think it does have an effect in
16	the sense that it discusses a part of the
17	profession that's not well-known to a lot of
18	historians, and that is historians acting as
Page 54
19	expert witnesses, generally, which is not
20	something that's well-known to lots of
21	people in the profession. And it's -- and,
22	in particular, it's especially, within that
23	subset, people that have advised or
24	consulted for the tobacco industry or have
25	testified as experts at the request of the
61
1	industry, that also is not well-known.
2	But keep in mind, that article was
3	published in a journal called Tobacco
4	Control. And I don't know how many
5	historians have actually read that article.
6	it's probably quite a small number because
7	that's a public health article, and that's
8	really for people who are involved in issues
9	related to tobacco.
10	You can go back and look at that
11	article and the people that have appeared in
12	that, and I think you would be hard pressed
13	to find more than two or three or four
14	historians who have ever published in it.
15	Q. Do you remember what my question
16	was?
17	A. Yes, I did. I gave you a good
18	answer.
19	MS. CASE:
20	Could you read back my question,
21	please.
22	COURT REPORTER:
23	"You think it has no effect on
24	academic historians in any capacity?"
25	MS. CASE:
62
1	Q. Could you answer my question,
2	please?
3	A. Well, I think it has -- I gave you
4	--it has some effect in the ways that I
5	described previously, I just did a moment
6	ago.
7	Q. Which would simply be notifying the
8	few historians that may read Tobacco Control
9	about the use of expert witnesses in
10	litigation? Does that fairly summarize what
11	you believe the effect to be?
12	A. You did it better than I did.
13	That's very good.
14	Q. Maybe one day we could switch
15	chairs, we'll get out of here a little
16	quicker.
17	Dr. Proctor has communicated with
18	you by e-mail about his contacts with
19	Professor Smocovitis at the University of
20	Florida, correct?
21	A. He forwarded those two e-mails, and
22	I've discussed those, and you have those,
23	yes.
24	Q. And his contacts with -- "his"
Page 56
25	meaning Dr. Proctor's contacts with
1	Professor smocovitis related to research
2	assistants that several graduate students at
3	the University of Florida were providing to
4	Dr. Gregg Michel, a defense historian; is
5	that true?
6	A. That's right. Yes.
7	Q. And you received the two e-mails
8	from Proctor forwarding his communications
9	with Professor Smocovitis May 3rd and June
10	8th of this year; is that true?
11	A. Those are the dates, as I recall
12	them.
13	Q. And each of those two e-mails
14	forwards to you three e-mails between Dr.
15	Proctor and Professor smocovitis discussing
16	the fact that there were graduate students
17	assisting defense counsel; is that right?
18	A. That sounds right, yes. It's an
19	extensive correspondence. I didn't count it
20	up, but that sounds about right.
21	Q. But Dr. Proctor is forwarding you a
22	chain of e-mails when he sends you each of
23	those two e-mails, correct?
24	A. Right. That's what was in there.
25	Q. And the e-mails that you received
64
1	from Dr. Proctor had a different title on
2	them when he forwarded them to you than when
3	he was communicating with Professor
4	Smocovitis. Do you recall that?
5	A. No. I haven't studied them that
6	carefully.
7	Q. Now, in May of this year, you sent
8	Dr. Proctor, by e-mail, a transcript of Dr.
9	Michel's deposition testimony in Martin; is
10	that true?
11	A. That's true, yes.
12	Q. And you did that because, I believe
13	you testified, that you like to keep track
14	of who is testifying on behalf of the
15	defense in smoking and health cases; is that
16	right?
17	A. Yes. I mean, I wrote that article
18	and I kind of keep up on that, yes.
19	Q. So you believe that to be related to
20	your article, the forwarding of the
21	transcript to Dr. Proctor?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And that relates to the articles
24	you've both written criticizing defense
25	historians?
65
1	A. That's correct.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	Q. Plaintiff's attorney in Martin had
3	forwarded you the transcript; is that right?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. And I believe you told me in the
6	Barbanell deposition that you hadn't read
7	the transcript of Dr. Michel's deposition
8	before sending it to Dr. Proctor, is that
9	still true?
10	A. That's correct, yes.
11	Q. Have you read it since?
12	A. No, I haven't, actually.
13	Q. And you forwarded it to Dr. Proctor
14	because you believed he would be interested
15	in Dr. Michel's testimony?
16	A. Well, I forwarded it to him because
17	it was an easy way to say, as I said in the
18	forwarding e-mail -- and I'm paraphrasing --
19	here's another historian working for R.J.
20	Reynolds.
21	Q. But no one asked you to forward the
22	deposition testimony to Dr. Proctor,
23	correct?
24	A. No. No. I did that on my own.
25	Q. So you could have chosen not to send
66
1	the deposition testimony to Dr. Proctor; is
2	that true?
3	A. That's true, yes.
4	Q. Now, you've come to learn that after
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	you forwarded that transcript, Dr. Proctor
6	began communicating with Professor
7	Smocovitis at the University of Florida; is
8	that right?
9	A. I've come to learn that. That's
10	right.
11	Q. And you understand that there were
12	certain graduate students identified by Dr.
13	Michel during the deposition in Martin?
14	A. Right. I guess the -- his research
15	assistants.
16	Q. And some of them were at the
17	University of Florida?
18	A. That's what I understand, yes.
19	Q. And so the topic of the
20	communications between Dr. Proctor and
21	Smocovitis were the graduate students at the
22	University of Florida where she works, Dr.
23	Smocovitis, and those graduate students
24	assisting defense expert Gregg Michel?
25	A. That's correct.
67
1	Q. And the same day that Dr. Proctor
2	began communicating with Professor
3	Smocovitis, he forwarded you the e-mail
4	string of their conversation that they had
5	had; is that right?
6	A. oh, I would have to look at the
7	notes. You know, I haven't reviewed those
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	e-mails very carefully. I mean, that would
9	be an objective fact that could be
10	established by the e-mail, which you are
11	handing me.
12	(Exhibit 9 was marked.)
13	MS. CASE:
14	I'm handing you what's been marked
15	Exhibit 9, for the sake of associates
16	drafting motions in limine in the future.
17	A. okay, it's the same day. Yeah. I
18	just didn't have that in my memory.
19	Q. And what I handed you, Exhibit 9,
20	was an e-mail from Dr. Proctor, to you, on
21	Saturday, May 23rd, at 4:24 p.m., and it's
22	titled "Spreading the word." Do you see
23	that at the top?
24	A. Uh-huh. Yes.
25	Q. And beneath, what he's forwarding
68
1	you is communication with Professor
2	smocovitis that had occurred also on May
3	23rd --
4	A. At least at the top, yes.
5	Q. if you want to take a look at both
6	of the e-mails. This one includes two
7	e-mails.
8	VIDEO REPORTER:
9	Stand by. we're going off the
10	record. This concludes Tape 1 of the
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	deposition of Louis Kyriakoudes. The time
12	is 10:17.
13	(Off the record.)
14	(Exhibit 10 was marked.)
15	VIDEO REPORTER:
16	This is Tape 2 in the deposition of
17	Louis Kyriakoudes. The time is 10:18.
18	MS. CASE:
19	Q. Still on Exhibit 9, professor, which
20	you received on May 23rd, can you confirm
21	for me that both of the e-mails or actually
22	all three of the e-mails back and forth
23	between Dr. Proctor and Smocovitis were also
24	on May 23rd?
25	A. Yes. They're all from the same day.
69
1	Q. So you agree that the same day that
2	he forwarded the communication to you, this
3	first one, was the same day that he
4	initiated his communication with Professor
5	Smocovitis?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And I believe you've testified that
8	you opened and read that e-mail on May 23rd;
9	is that right?
10	A. I skimmed it very briefly and it
11	didn't seem to require any action on my
12	part. I certainly didn't read the entire
13	thing. It's a very lengthy e-mail.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	Q. So on May 23rd -- I'm sorry. Were
15	you finished?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. On May 23rd, you opened the e-mail
18	that Robert Proctor had sent you on May
19	23rd?
20	A. Oh, I don't know if I opened it that
21	day. I couldn't tell you if I read it that
22	day or the next day or -- I don't remember
23	when I encountered that e-mail. I had
24	forgotten about it. That was an e-mail that
25	made no impression upon me; otherwise, I
70
1	would have mentioned -- I didn't have a
2	memory of that particular e-mail.
3	Q. Had you received similar e-mails
4	from Dr. Proctor in the past?
5	A. similar? we have, in the past,
6	discussed historians testifying for the
7	industry, particularly when we were working
8	on the data project. So, yeah, I guess I
9	have.
10	Q. Had he ever forwarded you an e-mail
11	string between himself and another third
12	party?
13	A. I don't think so.
14	Q. So this is the first time it
15	occurred, to your knowledge?
16	A. Yes. This is probably the first
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	time it occurred. I'm busy. This is not my
18	main job. And so, you know, if there's
19	nothing that requires me to respond to an
20	e-mail, I move on.
21	Q. Is it true that this year, more than
22	half your income is derived from cigarette
23	litigation?
24	A. Yes, but not half my time.
25	Q. Two days after you received this
71
1	e-mail from Dr. Proctor, you were deposed in
2	the Campbell case. Do you recall that?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And you didn't bring the e-mail from
5	Dr. Proctor to anyone's attention during the
6	Campbell deposition; is that true?
7	A. No. I didn't bring that e-mail. I
8	probably hadn't read it.
9	Q. And you did not produce a copy of
10	the May 23rd e-mail from Dr. Proctor at your
11	May 25th Campbell deposition, did you?
12	A. No.
13	Q. On June 8th, you received a second
14	e-mail from Dr. Proctor forwarding more
15	communications with Dr. Smocovitis at the
16	University of Florida about Dr. Michel's
17	graduate students. Do you recall that?
18	A. Well, I know that -- I mean, I
19	recall it when I found it in my e-mail
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	files, when I was searching for another
21	e-mail in response to a request by one of
22	the defense attorneys.
23	Q. So you did receive an e-mail dated
24	June 8th from Dr. Proctor; is that true?
25	A. That's true, yes.
72
1	Q. But you maintain that you didn't
2	read that e-mail at the time that it was
3	sent?
4	A. No. I didn't even know that I had
5	that in there.
6	Q. when do you believe that you read
7	that e-mail?
8	MR. QUINN:
9	I'm going to object at this point in
10	time. And I want to put this on the record.
11	MS. CASE:
12	Can you let him finish the question?
13	MR. QUINN:
14	No. I'm going to object, then he
15	can finish the question.
16	All of this information, all of this
17	questioning has already been done once. And
18	I've read it, and I don't think it has a
19	thing in the world to do with him testifying
20	as an expert in the Hibner and the Humpal
21	case.
22	And so because it is my
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	understanding that this deposition is of an
24	expert who is going to testify in Humpal and
25	Hibner, that's how he was identified, and
73
1	that is my understanding of what the notice
2	was for, you know the rule and I know the
3	rule as to what you are supposed to be
4	asking, for purposes of an expert's
5	deposition.
6	This is way beyond that, and the
7	proof that it is way beyond that is you
8	asking him early in this deposition whether
9	he had a lawyer. And, to me, that means
10	that there may be some other reason other
11	than just deposing this gentleman because he
12	is an expert in Hibner and Humpal.
13	Had I known that, and had I known, I
14	would have filed a protective order and let
15	the court know these things that you are
16	attempting to go into that have nothing to
17	do with what he's going to testify about.
18	I'm putting that objection on the
19	record because this witness needs to know
20	that you may be deposing him for something
21	other than his testimony in Hibner and
22	Humpal. I don't know what it is, but I'm
23	smart enough to know that it's beyond
24	finding out what he's going to testify to in
25	Humpal and Hibner. And so I'm putting that
74
1	objection on the record, that I think it is
2	beyond the scope of the rule regarding
3	experts and I want him to know that.
4	Now, go on.
5	MS. CASE:
6	You are through with your --
7	MR. QUINN:
8	I am through for the time being.
9	MS. CASE:
10	I understand that questions as to
11	bias and truthfulness are always relevant to
12	an expert's testimony, and that certainly
13	relates to his testimony in Hibner and
14	Humpal, so I'm going to continue.
15	MR. QUINN:
16	But that is not what you are asking
17	him, about his bias. You are asking him
18	about his relationship with Proctor, which
19	is a totally different issue here. I know
20	the road you are going down in Proctor.
21	This man is not on that road.
22	And if your attempt is to put him on
23	that road, then that's a different
24	deposition than the deposition that you've
25	noticed today, and your asking him whether
75
1	he has a lawyer should trigger him to that.
2	And if that's what you want to do,
3	if your attempt is to destroy this man's
4	character, then maybe we ought to postpone
5	this, let you guys determine that that's
6	what you want to do, and then let this man
7	go hire himself a lawyer and see what kind
8	of causes of action may arise from your
9	attempting to do that.
10	Or, we can take this deposition for
11	what it is, and that is, a discovery
12	deposition. Now, that's all I've got to say
13	about it.
14	MR. HENK:
15	I want to say, for the record, for
16	Philip Morris that I disagree with
17	everything that Mr. Quinn just said.
18	MR. QUINN:
19	Am I supposed to be surprised at
20	that?
21	MR. HENK:
22	I'm just making a statement, sir. I
23	didn't respond to what you said. I am just
24	saying, for the record, I disagree 100
25	percent with what you said.
76
1	And, Mr. Quinn, neither you, nor any
2	other lawyers in the room get to decide the
3	scope of cross-examination at trial of Dr.
Page 68
4	Kyriakoudes. That's the judge's role.
5	And that's all I'm going to say for
6	the record right now.
7	MR. QUINN:
8	And I've already stated to you that
9	I'm not --
10	MR. HENK:
11	Then why are you going to restate
12	it?
13	MR. QUINN:
14	That I'm not going to interfere with
15	questions that deal with his testimony. And
16	all I'm saying is, is that if it is for some
17	other purpose, you should have let him know
18	that it was for some other purpose.
19	MS. CASE:
20	Questions relating to Professor
21	Kyriakoudes's bias and willingness to comply
22	with the oath are relevant in any deposition
23	that he takes, if we have reason to ask
24	questions with regard to those, we are fully
25	entitled to do so. That relates to trial
77
1	testimony in any case in which he would
2	testify.
3	MR. QUINN:
4	Well, I've put my objection on the
5	record, we'll take it up later.
6	MS. CASE:
7	Q. Now, on June 25th, you were deposed
8	in the Barbanell case. Do you recall that?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And during the Barbanell deposition,
11	I asked you about your communications with
12	Dr. Proctor and the Florida graduate
13	students. Do you recall that?
14	A. is that how you asked it? You asked
15	me if I was aware of that situation.
16	Q. I asked you about your
17	communications with Dr. Proctor. Do you
18	recall that? I asked you if you had sent
19	him the transcript.
20	A. Oh, that question. Yeah, and I
21	answered that. I told you that I had, yes.
22	Q. And you told me, at that time, that
23	-- you admitted that you had forwarded the
24	transcript to Dr. Proctor.
25	A. Yes. Of course, I have.
78
1	Q. And you testified that was the only
2	communication between you and Dr. Proctor on
3	the matter.
4	A. That's right. And I was answering
5	truthfully because that's all I -- I
6	understood to be the only communication.
7	Q. And June 25th was after you had
8	received the two e-mails on May 3rd -- 23rd
9	and June 8, correct?
10	A. I've explained that in the Koballa
11	deposition. You can refer to my answer on
12	that.
13	Q. And in Barbanell, you did not
14	produce the two e-mails that we've marked
15	Exhibits 9 and 10?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. And so you had these e-mails in your
18	possession, but you didn't produce them?
19	MR. QUINN:
20	Object.
21	A. Well, I didn't know that I had them
22	in my possession.
23	MS. CASE:
24	Q. I didn't ask you if you knew you had
25	them in your possession. I asked them if
79
1	you had them in your possession and didn't
2	produce them.
3	MR. QUINN:
4	Object, argumentative.
5	A. Yes. They were in my possession.
6	That's true.
7	MS. CASE:
8	Q. And you were later deposed in the
9	Grossman case on July 9th. Do you recall
10	that?
11	A. Yes, I do.
12	Q. It was just after your family
Page 71
13	vacation, correct?
14	A. That's right.
15	Q. And during that deposition, you were
16	again asked about your communications with
17	Dr. Proctor and the Florida grad students.
18	You recall that?
19	A. That's right.
20	Q. And on July 9th, you did not
21	disclose the two e-mails marked Exhibits 9
22	and 10?
23	A. No. But what I did say was that I
24	had --
25	Q. Professor --
80
1	A. I have to explain. That I had the
2	forwarded e-mail that we've referred to,
3	where I sent Mr. Proctor the deposition.
4	And they asked for me to produce that. And
5	I said, sure, and when I went and searched
6	for that, that's when I discovered these
7	other two e-mails.
8	Q. So after you were deposed in the
9	Grossman case on July 9th, you went back to
10	your e-mail and you searched for
11	communications with Proctor; is that true?
12	A. Yes. Later in that month, yes, and
13	then came up -- sometime after that period,
14	yes.
15	Q. And it's your testimony that you did
Page 72
16	so because defense counsel's questions made
17	you think to do that?
18	A. Well, they made us -- they asked me
19	for -- I identified a piece of e-mail
20	correspondence that I did know about and had
21	in my files. I mean, I get 150 e-mails a
22	day, sometimes more. And very little of it
23	is spam. But I did identify to them this
24	forwarded e-mail. And they said, well, can
25	we have a copy of that? And I said, sure,
81
1	I'll go back and look for it. And in the
2	process of pulling that out of my file, I
3	discovered these other two e-mails.
4	Q. With the understanding that the
5	impetus to go back and search your e-mail
6	occurred at the July 9th deposition in the
7	Grossman case, I want you to give me your
8	best recollection of when you went and
9	searched for communications with Proctor in
10	your GMail.
11	A. It would have been, you know, later
12	in that month, probably towards the --
13	towards the end of July, when I started
14	thinking about the -- started thinking about
15	this tobacco stuff again, when I have to
16	think about it and do stuff to it, I work on
17	it and then do my main job.
18	Q. What computer did you search for
Page 73
19	those communications with Proctor? was it a
20	home computer, office computer?
21	A. My office computer that I access
22	through the -- you know, GMail is a
23	web-based service.
24	Q. And so you were in your office at
25	University of Southern Mississippi on that
82
1	computer and --
2	A. Well, I bring that computer home. I
3	was probably at home because I worked at
4	home for two weeks, basically the second
5	half of July.
6	Q. So you have a laptop that's provided
7	by your university?
8	A. That's right.
9	Q. And you take that between home and
10	work?
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. Is that the only computer that you
13	access your GMail account on?
14	A. No. I mean, I can access it through
15	any public terminal.
16	Q. Do you have a home computer?
17	A. Not one that I use. My -- we have
18	just laptops in our home. Sometimes I might
19	use my wife's computer, but generally,
20	that's not my practice.
21	Q. Do you have a recollection of using
Page 74
22	your university-issued laptop computer when
23	you performed the search for Proctor in your
24	GMai1 in box?
25	A. Yes. I would have used my laptop.
83
1	Q. You know that an analysis of your
2	computer hard drive would tell us precisely
3	when you searched for Proctor in your GMail
4	in box.
5	A. I'm not a computer expert, but I
6	wouldn't be surprised by that.
7	Q. Would you be willing to have your
8	computer examined by a forensic expert for
9	the limited purpose of ascertaining when
10	exactly you searched for communications with
11	Proctor in your Gmail?
12	A. okay. This has reached the point,
13	having taken into consideration what Mr.
14	Quinn has said, I'm not going to answer any
15	more of these questions. They don't seem
16	relevant to the case, if you want to
17	re-notice this deposition and I can hire an
18	attorney, I'll be happy to do that.
19	Q. So I will take that as a no, you
20	would not be willing to have your hard drive
21	examined to determine when, precisely, you
22	searched for communications with Proctor?
23	MR. QUINN:
24	Object. That was not his answer. I
Page 75
25	didn't hear a "no" anywhere.
1	A. That's my answer. I'm not going to
2	elaborate or add to that.
3	MS. CASE:
4	Q. So you won't tell me whether or not
5	you are -- you certainly aren't willing to
6	agree to allow us to have your hard drive
7	examined to answer this question; is that
8	fai r?
9	MR. QUINN:
10	Object.
11	A. I will refer to my previous answer.
12	MS. CASE:
13	Q. Which did not answer the question,
14	in my opinion.
15	A. Okay.
16	Q. Are you willing to let us look at
17	your computer?
18	MR. QUINN:
19	Object, asked and answered.
20	MS. CASE:
21	Q. Do you have something to hide?
22	A. No. I have nothing to hide, but
23	this is -- again, taking into account what
24	Mr. Quinn said, I came to this deposition
25	thinking that this would be a deposition
85
1	about my professional opinions related to
2	this case, Hibner and Humpal, and this is a
3	different matter altogether.
4	Q. But you are not willing to answer my
5	question?
6	All right. So I will take that as a
7	no on the computer hard drive search.
8	MR. QUINN:
9	Object.
10	MS. CASE:
11	Q. Shortly after --
12	MR. QUINN:
13	That's a statement, not a question.
14	MS. CASE:
15	Q. Going with late July being the time
16	you roughly discovered these communications
17	with Proctor that you had in your e-mail, it
18	was more than a month before you produced
19	those; is that right?
20	A. That's true.
21	Q. And the very first time you produced
22	them was at your August 24th deposition in
23	the Koballa case?
24	A. That's true.
25	Q. Now, you testified at the Barbanell
86
1	trial in Fort Lauderdale on July 27th and
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	28th. Do you recall that?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. And had you found the two e-mails
5	from Proctor before you testified in the
6	Barbanell trial?
7	A. I think so. I think I had found
8	them before then.
9	Q. But you didn't bring that discovery
10	to anyone's attention?
11	A. it didn't seem to matter to me. I
12	was focused on other matters.
13	Q. So you knew that you had testified
14	that you had simply one e-mail that you had
15	sent to Proctor forwarding Dr. Michel's
16	transcript and you testified to that in the
17	Barbanell deposition. Do you recall that?
18	A. I'm going to refresh my memory. I
19	don't think you asked me about e-mails in
20	that testimony.
21	Q. Would you consider a question about
22	communications to be a question about
23	e-mails?
24	A. Yes, I would. You asked me about --
25	I'm looking here at the testimony. You
87
1	asked me about a bunch of hypotheticals,
2	about outing people, about writing articles,
3	and a bunch of, I would describe it as value
4	questions, about whether the wisdom of
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	pursuing this particular line of activity on
6	the part of an expert, and I gave you my
7	answers on that.
8	MS. CASE:
9	Move to strike as not responsive to
10	any question.
11	A. Proceed.
12	MS. CASE:
13	Q. Could you answer the question?
14	A. I did.
15	Q. Do you recall indicating that the
16	entire universe of your communications with
17	Dr. Proctor relating in any way to Dr.
18	Michel's research assistants was simply
19	forwarding the first e-mail of Dr. Michel's
20	transcript?
21	A. That was my recollection. When I
22	gave -- whatever I said in the deposition,
23	my recollection and my knowledge, when I
24	gave that deposition in Barbanell, was that
25	was the only matter that I had relevant to
88
1	that.
2	Q. But by the time of the Barbanell
3	trial at the end of July, you knew that
4	wasn't the case; is that true?
5	A. Right. That's -- I had searched for
6	those e-mails and I didn't think anything of
7	it because it certainly wasn't anything I
8	was i nvolved i n.
9	Q. And so when you testified at the
10	Barbanell trial, you knew that your
11	testimony had been inaccurate at the
12	Barbanell deposition?
13	A. Well, I don't feel like it was that
14	inaccurate. All I know is that when I
15	searched for those e-mails, I found those
16	two forwarded e-mails in my files that I had
17	not been aware of. But if I had been asked
18	at the Barbanell trial about them, I
19	certainly would have answered about them,
20	but I wasn't asked that.
21	Q. At the time of the Barbanell trial,
22	you and Dr. Proctor were the only two people
23	who knew about those e-mails; is that right?
24	A. Well, I knew what I had. I guess he
25	would be the other -- I mean, I can't speak
89
1	to what he knows. He sent them to me,
2	obviously, but I'm only going to speak for
3	myself.
4	Q. You would assume that he knew that
5	he forwarded you those e-mails, correct?
6	A. Yes. I would assume that, yes.
7	Q. So as far as you knew, you were the
8	only two who had any knowledge of those
9	communications between you and Dr. Proctor?
10	A. Well, they're forwarded e-mails
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	between another person, Betty smocovitis.
12	She probably knew about them.
13	Q. I'm talking about his forwarding
14	them to you. Do you have any reason to
15	believe she knew he had forwarded them to
16	you?
17	A. I wouldn't know either way.
18	Q. So as far as you know, the only
19	people that you know for sure had any idea
20	about these e-mails marked Exhibits 9 and 10
21	were you and Dr. Proctor?
22	A. I guess so. That would seem
23	reasonable.
24	Q. So is there any reason to expect
25	that at the Barbanell trial you would have
90
1	been asked questions about e-mails that
2	defense counsel didn't know existed?
3	MR. QUINN:
4	Object to the form.
5	A. it's reasonable.
6	MS. CASE:
7	Q. So would you consider the testimony
8	you gave in the Barbanell trial to be the
9	truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
10	truth?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Even though you hadn't corrected
13	your misstatement from the deposition,
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	however inadvertent?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. You were under oath again on August
17	5th, when you testified in the Martin trial.
18	Do you recall that?
19	A. Yes. No. I think that was a
20	different trial.
21	Q. is it the Campbell trial?
22	A. That's right.
23	Q. My mistake. So the Campbell trial
24	was August 5th, is when you testified there.
25	A. That sounds right.
91
1	Q. And, again, obviously, you had
2	already found the e-mails from Dr. Proctor
3	by that time?
4	A. That's right.
5	Q. But you didn't bring those to
6	anyone's attention in relation to your
7	testimony in Campbell?
8	A. No. I didn't see them to be
9	relevant.
10	Q. Then again you were deposed on
11	August 19th in the Willis and Evers cases,
12	and you didn't bring those e-mails to
13	anyone's attention at that time?
14	A. No. It didn't come up in those
15	depositions.
16	Q. You received a Schedule A attached
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	to your Notice of Deposition in both Willis
18	and Evers, correct?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. And as you testified earlier today,
21	it is your practice to review schedule A
22	prior to attending a deposition, correct?
23	A. That's right.
24	Q. So you believe you reviewed Schedule
25	A prior to your Willis deposition on August
92
1	19th?
2	A. Yes. And I brought the materials
3	relevant to the Willis case.
4	Q. You don't find your e-mails with Dr.
5	Proctor to be relevant to the Willis case?
6	A. Say that again.
7	Q. Do you believe your e-mails with Dr.
8	Proctor, these two e-mails, Exhibits 9 and
9	10, you believe those were not responsive to
10	the document request you received in the
11	Willis case?
12	A. I didn't think they were.
13	Q. Now, on Friday, August 21st, you
14	called Dr. Proctor and spoke to him on the
15	telephone; is that true?
16	A. That's right.
17	Q. And you called him or he called you?
18	A. I answered questions related to this
19	back in the Koballa case.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	Q. It was unclear to me, so I want to
21	confirm whether you called him or he called
22	you.
23	A. I'm not exactly sure who called
24	whom. But I did talk to him on the phone.
25	Q. Regardless of who called who, you
93
1	learned, during that conversation with Dr.
2	Proctor on August 21st, that his e-mails had
3	been subpoenaed from Stanford; is that true?
4	A. Well, I thought -- I thought his
5	e-mails to the university of Florida had
6	been subpoenaed. That's what I understood.
7	Q. So you learned during that phone
8	call that there was a subpoena asking for
9	Proctor's e-mails to the University of
10	Florida?
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. So is it your testimony that you
13	were unaware that e-mails had been
14	subpoenaed from Stanford, as well?
15	A. You know, I didn't read -- I didn't
16	see a subpoena, it seemed like you were
17	doing the full court press on him, so you
18	probably were getting, you know -- using a
19	shotgun approach, so I wouldn't be surprised
20	if you were going for everything.
21	Q. You wouldn't be surprised if the
22	defense counsel had requested the e-mails
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	from Stanford, as well?
24	A. That's true.
25	Q. So August 21st was when you first
94
1	learned about any subpoena related to Dr.
2	Proctor's e-mails?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. Did Matt Schultz's name come up
5	during the phone conversation with Dr.
6	Proctor?
7	A. I don't think so. I don't -- yes.
8	I don't know that he has a relationship with
9	Matt Schultz. I don't think he -- he may or
10	may not even know him.
11	Q. what did Dr. Proctor say about the
12	subpoena or subpoenas?
13	MR. QUINN:
14	Have you testified to this
15	previously?
16	THE WITNESS:
17	I testified to this previously.
18	MR. QUINN:
19	Would you like to refresh your
20	memory by looking at what you testified to
21	previously?
22	A. I brought it with me and I'm going
23	to take my time. This has really gone to a
24	new level. I mean, I've been forthcoming
25	with you on these matters, and, you know,
95
1	you are wanting to use it for another reason
2	and my patience with this is just about
3	over. So, you know --
4	MS. CASE:
5	Q. Would you refresh your recollection,
6	si r?
7	A. Yeah. I'm going to take my time.
8	MS. CASE:
9	Why don't we take a short break
10	while the doctor refreshes his recollection.
11	VIDEO REPORTER:
12	Stand by. we are going off the
13	record. The time is 10:43.
14	(Off the record.)
15	VIDEO REPORTER:
16	We are back on the record. The time
17	is 11:01.
18	MS. CASE:
19	Q. Professor, have you had a chance to
20	refresh your recollection?
21	A. I have, yes.
22	MS. CASE:
23	Monica, could you please read back
24	my last question?
25	COURT REPORTER:
96
1	"what did Dr. Proctor say about the
2	subpoena or subpoenas?"
3	A. Well, he told me that there was a
4	hearing on these issues that have come up in
5	all the depositions, so that's what he
6	talked about.
7	MS. CASE:
8	Q. what did he say about the hearing?
9	And let me just ask if what you are looking
10	at is your testimony in the Koballa
11	deposition, is that what you used to
12	refresh your recollection?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. And that's what you are looking at
15	right now?
16	A. That's right. And just so you know,
17	I'm going to read the answers verbatim that
18	are relevant to the question from Koballa.
19	Q. Do you not have a recollection of
20	what you discussed with Dr. Proctor about
21	the hearing? If you have an independent
22	recollection, I would ask that you
23	testify --
24	A. You've already asked me about this.
25	MR. QUINN:
97
1	And I'm going to object. This has
2	been asked and answered more than once and
3	this witness knows that.
4	MS. CASE:
5	Q. Would you answer, please?
6	A. Yes. Since I've been asked
7	questions on this already, I'll just refer
8	to my prior answer, and we can go through
9	this way or, you know, if you want to
10	expedite it. You are in control of that
11	process.
12	Q. My question was, what did Dr.
13	Proctor say about the hearing?
14	A. I talked to him on Friday afternoon.
15	Q. What was the question that you are
16	reading the response to?
17	A. We're on Page 227.
18	Q. For the record, if you wouldn't
19	mind, since you are going from the
20	deposition transcript, if you could read the
21	question that you are reading the answer
22	for, please.
23	A. "But even though you spoke with Dr.
24	Proctor on Friday, the same day as the
25	hearing, you didn't speak with Dr. Proctor
98
1	about the issue, correct?
2	"I don't think he -- he didn't bring
3	it up. I talked to him on Friday
4	afternoon. The hearing may not have been
5	over. I don't know what time this hearing
6	was held on Friday. He may not have even
Page 88
7	known, but we didn't talk about it."
8	And my recollection, my independent
9	recollection is that he told me that there
10	was a hearing, but the outcome was not known
11	to him at that time. That's my recollection
12	now. That may -- you know, I'm not a party
13	-- I don't know what actually went down in
14	your courtroom down in Volusia County, so I
15	don't have any independent knowledge of
16	that, outside of this situation.
17	Q. Did Dr. Proctor give you any
18	indication of what he expected the outcome
19	of that hearing would be?
20	A. No.
21	Q. Did he believe that the e-mails
22	would be produced?
23	MR. QUINN:
24	Object, asked and answered.
25	A. It didn't come up.
99
1	MS. CASE:
2	Q. On August 22nd, the following day
3	after you spoke with Proctor, you sent Matt
4	Schultz a text message; is that correct?
5	A. Yes. We had a deposition scheduled
6	for that week.
7	Q. And did you send this text message
8	from your personal cell phone?
9	A. Yes, I did.
10	Q. And who is your wireless carrier?
11	A. I have an iPhone.
12	Q. A wireless carrier would be, like,
13	AT&T or --
14	A. AT&T. Only AT&T does iPhone.
15	Q. Is your account a personal account
16	or is it through the university?
17	A. It's my own account.
18	Q. Are you the primary name on the
19	account or is it in someone else's name?
20	MR. QUINN:
21	I'm going to object to this line of
22	questioning. This is beyond the scope of
23	him as an expert witness. If you read the
24	rule, it is clear that it's beyond the scope
25	of him being produced as an expert witness.
100
1	We are here and we are ready to talk
2	about Hibner and Koballa and his testimony
3	in those cases, we are not here to rehash
4	what has already been testified to about
5	Proctor and his involvement with Proctor.
6	That's not why we're here. Okay?
7	MS. CASE:
8	I'm currently asking --
9	MR. QUINN:
10	And I don't represent him regarding
11	that. I represent him regarding why we are
12	here. And I'm going to ask you to move away
Page 90
13	from this line of questioning and to ask him
14	the questions that you need to ask him so
15	that you will know what he's going to
16	testify to in Humpal and Hibner. Because I
17	don't know how much longer he's going to
18	answer your questions about Proctor.
19	A. I'm not going to answer them
20	without an attorney representing me. So you
21	can ask your questions and I will sit here
22	and I will give the same answer.
23	MR. QUINN:
24	Now, doctor, are you doing that
25	because you have already answered questions
101
1	about this before in detail?
2	MS. CASE:
3	Object to that question. This is
4	my deposition --
5	MR. QUINN:
6	Let me tell you something. You are
7	absolutely right. This is so --
8	MS. CASE:
9	You are directing him not to answer?
10	MR. QUINN:
11	This is so unusual, and this is so
12	out of context and out of character for a
13	lawyer to be speaking up like this. I
14	understand that. But I also understand that
15	you are way out of bounds, as far as I am
Page 91
16	concerned.
17	And since I don't represent this
18	gentleman, I, as a lawyer, have a duty and
19	an obligation to tell him what's going on.
20	And to tell him that he came here under my
21	direction because I have hired him as an
22	expert, and he's an expert on Hibner and
23	Humpal , which are the cases that I'm going
24	to try. And he is here to answer your
25	questions about that.
102
1	And any questions that deal with his
2	bias or his prejudice that you think may
3	have bearing, he's already answered in prior
4	depositions, and he doesn't have to answer
5	it all over again.
6	We will answer questions about the
7	Hibner and the Humpal testimony that he
8	intends to give, but anything else beyond
9	that, it's his call, not mine.
10	MS. CASE:
11	So you are not directing him not to
12	answer?
13	MR. QUINN:
14	I'm not telling him anything. I
15	don't represent him. You've already made it
16	perfectly clear that I don't represent him
17	and that he doesn't have a lawyer here to
18	advise him, and you, as a lawyer, know that.
Page 92
19	Now, what is your obligation under
20	that, ma'am?
21	MS. CASE:
22	I don't answer questions at
23	deposition and I have no --
24	MR. QUINN:
25	Well, you know, normally, I don't
103
1	ask questions of a lawyer in a deposition,
2	but this is very strange and unusual, and so
3	I am.
4	THE WITNESS:
5	I'm going to take a break, and make
6	a contact, and retain an attorney and we can
7	reconvene this when I feel more comfortable
8	MS. CASE:
9	Sir, I haven't met with you before.
10	I'm addressing Mr. Quinn. I haven't met you
11	before. I don't know what your practice is
12	with regard to advising witnesses through
13	speaking objections. I feel that's what
14	you've done here.
15	Certainly, any question relevant to
16	Professor Kyriakoudes's bias and oath,
17	ability to take an oath and understand the
18	oath and comply with it, those are relevant
19	to his testimony, no matter what case it's
20	being taken in. My questions are entirely
21	appropriate and I'm entitled to answers to
Page 93
22	them, if the witness would like to take a
23	break and call an attorney, he's more than
24	welcome to do so.
25	MR. QUINN:
104
1	Your questions are repetitious.
2	Your questions have already been asked and
3	they've already been answered in prior
4	depositions.
5	Your attempt here and your only
6	attempt here is intimidation, and
7	intimidation is not a purpose of the
8	deposition, okay?
9	MS. CASE:
10	Sir, I'm simply asking very specific
11	direct questions.
12	MR. QUINN:
13	And we are more than happy --
14	THE WITNESS:
15	I'm stepping out of the room, if
16	it's on the record.
17	MR. QUINN:
18	-- to answer your questions, him as
19	an expert, in those two cases.
20	MS. CASE:
21	We're going to go off the record.
22	Mr. Quinn can continue his colloquy off the
23	record, if he'd like.
24	VIDEO REPORTER:
LKyriakoudes 10012009
25	We're going off the record. The
1	time is 11:09.
2	(Off the record.)
3	MS. CASE:
4	Q. Now, professor, you took a break to
5	make a phone call. Is there anything you
6	would like to say at this point?
7	A. No. I didn't -- I wasn't successful
8	in my phone call. Continue with your
9	questions.
10	Q. You are willing to answer my
11	questions at this time?
12	A. I'm willing to proceed.
13	Q. You are willing to proceed?
14	A. No. I meant, go ahead and proceed
15	with your questions.
16	Q. Had you ever sent Mr. Schultz a text
17	message before August 21st?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. How many times?
20	A. I wouldn't -- I don't keep track of
21	that.
22	Q. Is it your regular practice to
23	communicate with Mr. Schultz via text
24	message?
25	A. Regular practice? I'm not sure what
1	that means. I have text messages -- text
2	message with him on things like, for
3	example, he's asked me questions, where do
4	you want to eat the night before a
5	deposition.
6	Q. And have you ever produced those
7	communications in response to a Schedule A
8	to a deposition notice?
9	A. I wouldn't know how to produce them.
10	How do you print out a text message?
11	Q. So I'll take that as a no?
12	A. No.
13	Q. You haven't produced the content of
14	text messages with plaintiff's counsel at
15	any point; is that true?
16	A. That's right. I don't know how to
17	produce them.
18	Q. Any other counsel for plaintiffs in
19	Engle progeny litigation with whom you've
20	had text message communications?
21	A. I don't think anybody else. Matt
22	Schultz uses text, so he sent me text and I
23	reply to them.
24	Q. So the first -- I think you said the
25	first text was not August 21st.
1	A. No.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	Q. That wasn't the very first time?
3	A. No. But they've all been issues
4	related to the matters I just described to
5	you, which is, where do you want to get
6	dinner, I'm running behind, scheduling and
7	those kinds of things.
8	Q. Anything that you'd describe as
9	substantive?
10	A. No.
11	Q. Do you believe that the content of
12	text messages is confidential?
13	A. No. No.
14	Q. You understand that those are
15	discoverable communications?
16	A. How do I -- how do I print -- how do
17	I deliver them to you? I don't know how to
18	do that. I've always thought of text
19	messages being kind of throwaway messages.
20	But there may be some way to get them from
21	the phone company, but I don't know how to
22	do that and I don't have access to that.
23	Q. Do you consider text messages to be
24	more confidential than e-mails?
25	A. No. I would think they'd be less.
108
1	Q. Why?
2	A. Because they're -- you know, they're
3	throwaway conversations. I mean, I don't
4	think of either of them being confidential,
5	so --
6	Q. Okay. I'm not sure if you
7	specifically answered. Other than Matt
8	Schultz, can you name for me any other
9	counsel representing plaintiffs in Engle
10	progeny litigation with whom you've
11	exchanged text messages?
12	A. You know, I send text messages to
13	indicate things like I'm running behind, and
14	so people text all the time. I don't keep
15	track. I don't keep those in my possession.
16	I don't know how to keep those in my
17	possession, so therefore, I wouldn't know
18	how to produce them to you. I don't keep
19	track of text messages.
20	Q. To your recollection, are there any
21	other counsel representing plaintiffs in
22	Engle progeny litigation with whom you've
23	communicated via text message, their names,
24	please?
25	A. Oh, sure. Okay. I have, on
109
1	occasion, exchanged text messages with, I
2	believe, Gary Page, who I've worked with.
3	He uses text message. Not everyone uses it.
4	Q. Anyone else besides Matt Schultz and
5	Gary Page with whom you've exchanged text
6	messages?
7	A. Not that I can recall.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	Q. So those would be the only two?
9	A. That I can recall, that's right.
10	Q. Have you deleted text messages
11	either from Mr. Page or Mr. Schultz?
12	A. Yes, as soon as I get them. Your
13	phone fills up very quickly, so you have to
14	delete them.
15	Q. So you deleted the text message that
16	you sent to Mr. Schultz August 21st, 22nd?
17	A. August 21st or 22nd? I don't know.
18	I mean, how do you retrieve text messages?
19	Q. You really don't know?
20	A. I mean, they pop up on your phone,
21	and then you read them, and then aren't they
22	deleted right after that?
23	Q. And you have an iPhone, correct?
24	A. Right. I mean, I would have to go
25	and look, you know.
110
1	Q. You don't know how to search for
2	text messages that you've received on your
3	phone?
4	A. No.
5	Q. is that the case?
6	A. Right. I mean, there may be a way.
7	I've only had this phone since June.
8	Q. Have you -- to your knowledge, have
9	you changed some setting so that all text
10	messages are deleted once they're read?
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	Have you taken steps to affirmatively make
12	that how your phone operates?
13	A. No. You know, you might be
14	imparting to me a higher level of technical
15	sophistication. Text messaging is just
16	something that I started doing with -- when
17	I got the iPhone, which I got in June.
18	Q. As best you can recall, what was the
19	extent of your text messages that you sent
20	to Matt Schultz?
21	A. Oh, yeah. Give me a call.
22	Q. That was it?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Did he respond via text message?
25	A. Yes.
Ill
1	Q. what was his response via text
2	message?
3	A. I believe what he said was, at the
4	beach with the kids, call you later.
5	Q. And did you respond by a text
6	message to his response?
7	A. No.
8	Q. You waited for him to call you?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. And then he did call you?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. That same day?
13	A. I think it was that day, yes.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	Q. And the purpose of that call, I
15	think you said you had a deposition coming
16	up that week?
17	A. Uh-huh. That's correct.
18	Q. And you talked about arrangements
19	for that deposition?
20	A. That's right.
21	Q. And you also talked briefly about
22	the situation with the subpoena with Dr.
23	Proctor, correct?
24	A. That's right.
25	Q. Why did you think to ask Mr. Schultz
112
1	about the situation with the subpoena for
2	Proctor's e-mails?
3	A. It just came up in the conversation.
4	Q. Who brought it up?
5	A. I don't know exactly. I can't
6	recall exactly who brought it up, to be
7	honest with you. It was a short
8	conversation, just a couple of three
9	minutes.
10	Q. Why did you think Mr. Schultz would
11	know about the hearing on the subpoenas?
12	A. He keeps up with -- I mean, it's his
13	job to keep up with that kind of thing. At
14	least I presume, my understanding is, as an
15	attorney, he keeps up with issues related to
16	tobacco 1i ti gati on.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	Q. And was that August 22nd phone call
18	the very first time that you had spoken with
19	Mr. Schultz about Dr. Proctor?
20	A. You mean generally? No. He's -- he
21	made mention that he was using Robert
22	Proctor on some of his cases, although, to
23	be honest with you, I can't recall if there
24	were any cases in which I participated in.
25	Q. Prior to that August 22nd phone
113
1	call, had you spoken with Matt Schultz at
2	all about the situation with Dr. Proctor and
3	the graduate students at the university of
4	Florida?
5	A. After it came up in the depositions,
6	I did make mention of it, yes.
7	Q. I'm asking if August 22nd, that
8	phone call was the first time that you spoke
9	with Mr. Schultz about it.
10	A. oh, I see. I had mentioned, we had
11	discussed it previously.
12	Q. When was that?
13	A. I wouldn't know exactly when. I
14	just know that we had some discussion about
15	it.
16	Q. Do you recall if that was before or
17	after your trial testimony in Barbanell?
18	A. I don't.
19	Q. Do you recall if it was before or
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	after your trial testimony in Campbell?
21	A. The trial testimony in Campbell, I
22	can't recall. I'm not sure about that. I
23	mean, you know, I'm busy. I have lots of
24	calls. I don't keep track of these things.
25	Q. So when you spoke with Mr. Schultz
114
1	on August 22nd about the situation with Dr.
2	Proctor and the Florida graduate students,
3	had it been more than a month since you had
4	first spoken with Mr. Schultz about the
5	issue?
6	A. I'm not sure. I mean, I just don't
7	really know. And I'm not sure if I had a
8	better recollection if I was asked about
9	this previously, so I'm going to take a
10	minute and refresh.
11	Q. Feel free. And, again, that's your
12	Koballa deposition transcript that you are
13	referring to?
14	A. That's correct. Okay. Yes. And
15	in the Koballa, I answered that I had asked
16	Schultz about the issue, so that's a more
17	accurate reflection, since this was closer
18	to the events. You had asked me that
19	previously in the discussion, who brought it
20	up, and I said that I --
21	Q. That wasn't exactly my question.
22	The question and answer in the Koballa
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	deposition was what you discussed during
24	that August 22nd phone call. What I'm
25	asking is times that you --
115
1	A. Well, I don't want to cut you off,
2	but I'm referring to you asked me a couple
3	questions ago. I'm just going back --
4	Q. So you are not answering my current
5	question, correct?
6	A. That's correct, yeah.
7	Q. Could you answer my current question
8	or do you still need to review your
9	testimony from the Koballa deposition?
10	A. Well, ask your current question.
11	MS. CASE:
12	Could you repeat my last question
13	prior to the witness refreshing his
14	recollection?
15	COURT REPORTER:
16	"So when you spoke with Mr. Schultz
17	on August 22nd about the situation with Dr.
18	Proctor and the Florida graduate students,
19	had it been more than a month since you had
20	first spoken with Mr. Schultz about the
21	issue?"
22	A. I don't recall when I spoke to him
23	about it, but there was no secret about
24	these issues, particularly after it came up
25	in my depositions. So I know I did speak to
1	him about it briefly prior to that, but I
2	don't remember exactly when.
3	MS. CASE:
4	Q. When you say "prior to that," you
5	mean prior to the August 22nd phone call?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. Did you speak with him about it
8	after the Barbanell deposition, within that
9	time frame?
10	A. I'm not sure. I couldn't answer
11	that. I can't recall.
12	Q. How about in relation to the
13	Grossman deposition on July 9th? Was it
14	after you had came back from vacation with
15	your family?
16	A. You know, I don't keep track of
17	these things, so I'm not sure. I couldn't
18	say affirmative either way.
19	Q. So you had certainly spoken before
20	August 22nd with Mr. Schultz about Proctor
21	and the Florida graduate students, correct?
22	A. Yes. And to be more precise, he had
23	mentioned that the defense was objecting to
24	a variety of activities alleged to have been
25	done by Dr. Proctor.
1	Q. Had you spoken with Mr. Schultz
2	prior to August 22nd about the situation
3	with Proctor and the Florida graduate
4	students once or more than once, to your
5	recollection?
6	A. Probably once, it was not a big
7	thing. It was just kind of -- you know, a
8	short, you know, kind of -- this is what
9	came up in my depositions, you know.
10	Q. So you are saying then it would have
11	been after when it first came up?
12	A. After the Barbanell.
13	Q. After the Barbanell?
14	A. Yes. it was after the Barbanell
15	deposition.
16	Q. So it was sometime between June 25th
17	and August 22nd?
18	A. Yes. That -- it would be in that
19	time period, that's true.
20	Q. And beyond that, you can't give me
21	any more specific recollection about when
22	you had this conversation with Mr. Schultz?
23	A. I mean, I'm busy, and I don't keep
24	track of these things.
25	Q. So you can't give me any more
118
1	specific --
2	A. No.
3	Q. Now, was August 22nd the first time
Page 106
4	you spoke with Mr. Schultz about the e-mails
5	that Proctor had forwarded you regarding the
6	Florida graduate students?
7	A. Yes. Yes.
8	Q. So even though you had spoken with
9	Mr. Schultz prior to August 22nd about the
10	situation with Proctor and the graduate
11	students, you didn't mention the e-mails
12	that you had in your possession when you
13	spoke with Mr. Schultz at that earlier time?
14	A. No. I never brought it up.
15	Q. But you knew about it at the time?
16	You knew that you had those e-mails in your
17	possession when you first spoke with him
18	about the Proctor situation?
19	A. I'm not sure. I mean, I searched --
20	I found those e-mails sometime towards the
21	middle or end of July, you know, when I was
22	getting ready to go, you know, just to look
23	for that third e-mail that we've talked
24	about. And I'm not sure. I couldn't give
25	you the answer to that. I just don't
119
1	recal1.
2	Q. Prior to you mentioning to Mr.
3	Schultz on August 22nd that you had the
4	e-mails marked as Exhibits 9 and 10, had you
5	spoken with anybody else about the fact that
6	you had Exhibits 9 and 10 in your
Page 107
7	possession?
8	A. No.
9	Q. He was the very first person that
10	you told?
11	A. Yes. That would be true. Yes. I
12	believe that was the case, yes.
13	Q. And why did you tell him?
14	A. Well, it came up in the
15	conversation. I told him that I had
16	discovered these e-mails, and that I was
17	going to, you know, produce them, just to
18	let him know. And he said, sure, go ahead.
19	Q. It's your testimony that you
20	informed Mr. Schultz during that August 22nd
21	phone call that it was your intention to
22	produce these e-mails, Exhibits 9 and 10, at
23	which deposition?
24	A. I'm not sure which -- the one I
25	produced them at, I guess, the Koballa, the
120
1	one where I was asked about them. Those are
2	the ones I produced them at.
3	Q. Now, you had found the e-mails in
4	July, correct?
5	A. Late July.
6	Q. Late July. And you were deposed on
7	August 19th, correct?
8	A. in Koballa?
9	Q. No. in Evers and Willis.
Page 108
10	A. Uh-huh. That's true.
11	Q. And on August 19th, you didn't
12	produce the e-mails, correct?
13	A. No. No. It didn't come up.
14	Q. So the reason that you decided to
15	produce the e-mails at the August 24th
16	Koballa deposition was because you learned
17	that Proctor's e-mails had been subpoenaed;
18	is that true?
19	A. No. Mr. Henk asked me about it and
20	that's why -- I told him. You can read the
21	testimony. He asked me about it.
22	Q. I thought you just testified that
23	during your August 22nd phone call with Mr.
24	Schultz, you indicated to him your intent to
25	produce these e-mails at your next
121
1	deposition.
2	A. And then my next deposition was --
3	when was my next deposition? I would have
4	to check.
5	Q. Two days later.
6	A. And which case was that?
7	Q. Koballa, August 24th. From the
8	conversation that you had with Mr. Schultz
9	on August 22nd -- that's a Saturday,
10	correct?
11	A. Right.
12	Q. And you told me that during your
Page 109
13	phone conversation with him, you indicated
14	to Mr. Schultz that you intended to produce
15	the e-mails from Dr. Proctor at your next
16	deposition, is that true?
17	A. Well, yes. I mean, I said I had
18	these e-mails and that, you know, that I --
19	you know, I didn't want to -- you know, I
20	wanted to send them on, to produce them.
21	That's right. And I think the next
22	opportunity I had was when Mr. Henk asked me
23	about it. And I think we took a break and I
24	went and printed them out on my computer.
25	Q. What I'm trying to get at is what
122
1	led you to tell Mr. Schultz that you were
2	going to produce the e-mails at your next
3	deposition?
4	A. oh, I had these. They seemed to be
5	-- you know, they seemed to be -- they seem
6	to have become an issue in the tobacco
7	litigation, and I certainly didn't, you
8	know, want to sit on anything, so I was
9	going to send them forward.
10	Q. So mid to late July, you find the
11	e-mai1.
12	A. Uh-huh.
13	Q. The e-mails, the two e-mails.
14	A. That's right.
15	Q. And then you go to the Barbanell
Page 110
16	trial in late July, yes?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And then you testify in Pensacola
19	the first week of August, right?
20	A. That's right.
21	Q. And then you were deposed in Willis
22	and Evers on August 19th?
23	A. That's right.
24	Q. And at none of those times did you
25	take the opportunity to produce those
123
1	e-mails, correct?
2	A. I was never asked about these
3	issues.
4	Q. What I want to know is, what changed
5	your mind? Why did you tell Mr. Schultz
6	that you were going to and intended to
7	produce them on August 22nd?
8	A. Well, I -- what I said was, I had
9	these e-mails, and I said that, you know, I
10	didn't know I had these e-mails when I was
11	asked initially, and that if I'm asked again
12	about these e-mails, I'm going to have to --
13	or if I'm asked again about this Proctor
14	business, to use that as a shorthand to
15	describe all that's going on, that I have
16	these. Now that I know that I have these,
17	I'm going to have to produce them.
18	Q. And the reason that you were
Page 111
19	suddenly inclined to produce them after you
20	learned that -- because you had learned they
21	had been subpoenaed from Dr. Proctor and
22	from the universities, correct?
23	A. No. Because I had discovered them
24	in late July. If I had been asked prior
25	about this issue, I would have identified it
124
1	then. It only became an item of
2	conversation in this talk on Saturday
3	because it was topical. I said, well, you
4	know, by the way, I should let you know that
5	I've -- you know, in the course of searching
6	my e-mails responsive to another request, I
7	found a couple of others that I didn't know
8	I had and didn't recall having, and that,
9	you know, the next time they ask me about
10	this, I'm going to have to produce those,
11	just to kind of let him -- you know, let him
12	know.
13	Q. But you hadn't produced them at the
14	first opportunity you had to produce them
15	after you discovered them, correct?
16	MR. QUINN:
17	Object to the form.
18	A. Well, I hadn't been asked about
19	them. I mean, I -- you know, you guys are
20	deposing me, on average, you know, once a
21	week, maybe once every other week on this.
Page 112
22	And, you know, lots of things come up in
23	these depositions. I answer the questions
24	to the best of my ability, and, you know,
25	honor the oath to the best of my -- humanly
125
1	possible.
2	And, you know, when it comes up, and
3	I'm asked about it, and I have new
4	information and I'm asked about these
5	issues, I answer it forthrightly.
6	Q. So it was not your intention to
7	produce the e-mails unless you were
8	specifically asked again whether you had
9	communications with Proctor beyond
10	forwarding the transcript of Michel's
11	deposition?
12	A. Well, you know, I understand
13	depositions to be opportunities for you to
14	ask me about my opinions related to the case
15	and those such issues, so when you ask me a
16	question, I give you the answer.
17	Q. So it was your intention to wait
18	until you were specifically asked again
19	about communications with Dr. Proctor before
20	you produced the e-mails?
21	A. That seemed to be the way to do it,
22	because when that issue came up, I had new
23	information, I would then provide that new
24	information, yes.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
25	Q. So even though you already had been
1	previously asked about communications with
2	Dr. Proctor, you didn't see the need to
3	correct that former testimony once you
4	discovered that you did, in fact, have those
5	in your possession?
6	A. No. I didn't see it that way. You
7	know, it's -- you have lots of opportunities
8	to ask me all kinds of questions. I mean,
9	it's not like you are only deposing me
10	occasionally. This is the third time I've
11	sat down with you in six weeks, so you guys
12	have lots of -- I mean, you are talking to
13	me a lot, so -- and it's becoming burdensome
14	to me, particularly given that my opinions
15	are pretty consistent, in fact, highly
16	consistent and practically generic.
17	So I just thought I would wait for
18	the next opportunity, since this train seems
19	to be regularly scheduled coming into the
20	station pretty regularly.
21	Q. And by "next opportunity," you mean
22	the next deposition after your conversation
23	with Mr. Schultz?
24	A. Well, I had a deposition scheduled
25	that week, and I was asked directly, and I
127
1	gave a direct answer.
2	Q. So you decided to wait until you
3	were asked directly to produce the e-mails
4	that you knew you had been asked about in
5	the past?
6	A. Well, yes. I mean, I didn't -- I'm
7	not in the habit of going back and reading
8	my prior testimony. That would be even more
9	burdensome. You know, when I am deposed, I
10	give the best answer I can and the truthful
11	answer. I discovered new information, and
12	when asked about that, supplied it to you.
13	Q. Well, you actually do go back and
14	read your testimony when you read and sign
15	your deposition; isn't that right?
16	A. Well, I have read this.
17	Q. And it's your practice to do so,
18	correct?
19	A. Well, no. I think you would be hard
20	pressed to find a deposition to which my
21	signature has been attached at the end. I
22	think it's been quite a while that I've
23	actually sat down and read the deposition
24	after the deposition.
25	Q. Well, now, you were sent your
128
1	Barbanell deposition on -- the deposition
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	occurred on June 15th. You were sent the
3	original and an errata sheet on June 30th.
4	Did you receive that?
5	A. I did.
6	Q. And have you -- and I believe that
7	it instructed you that you had 30 days,
8	under the rules, to read and sign the
9	deposition. Do you recall that?
10	A. Or it would be accepted as a default
11	truth. Right. And I opted for the default.
12	Q. And so if you received it on June
13	30th, or it was sent on June 30th, when do
14	you believe you received it?
15	A. oh, I believe I -- I believe the
16	unopened Fed-Ex is sitting in my office
17	right now.
18	Q. So you didn't even open it?
19	A. No.
20	Q. But by mid to late July, it came to
21	your attention that you had the e-mails
22	marked Exhibits 9 and 10; is that correct?
23	A. That's right.
24	Q. And, yet, you still decided to allow
25	the 30 days to lapse and to not make any
129
1	corrections to your Barbanell deposition
2	testimony?
3	A. Well, yes. I mean, I just -- I
4	discovered -- Barbanell was in the past. I
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	discovered the e-mails and I just thought
6	I'd bring them up the next time they were
7	relevant.
8	Q. What do you mean by the next time
9	they were relevant?
10	A. As I explained a moment ago, the
11	next time I was asked about it.
12	Q. Asked specifically and directly
13	about it?
14	A. Asked about the Proctor issue.
15	Q. Is it your testimony that you
16	weren't asked about the Proctor issue at
17	your August 19th deposition in the Evers
18	case?
19	A. I'd have to review that before I
20	looked at it.
21	Q. You don't recall me asking you
22	questions about the Proctor situation during
23	your August 19th deposition in Evers?
24	A. You know, they run together. I
25	mean, again, I just want to point out that
130
1	I've -- it's not like I only have these once
2	in a while, and therefore, they remain
3	distinct in my mind. There's a bunch of
4	them, so I would have to review that
5	testimony.
6	Q. You don't remember that?
7	A. Not as being distinct from other
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	depositions. I mean, there were -- I think
9	they happened within a week of each other.
10	I mean, they were compressed and there were
11	two depositions for Evers.
12	Q. Did you think that I would refuse to
13	accept the e-mails marked Exhibits 9 and 10
14	during your August 19 deposition in Evers?
15	A. No. My recollection is it didn't
16	seem to come up. Maybe I'm mistaken on
17	that, but that's my recollection.
18	Q. Now, August 19th was the first time
19	that we've met, correct?
20	A. In person?
21	Q. Yes, face to face.
22	A. I believe so, yes.

25	Number 2 in the deposition of Louis
131
1	Kyriakoudes. The time is 11:42.
2	(Off the record.)
3	VIDEO REPORTER:
4	We are back on the record. This is
5	Tape 3 of the deposition of Louis
6	Kyriakoudes, Ph.D. The time is 11:44.
7	MS. CASE:
8	Q. We were talking about your August
9	19th deposition in the Evers case. As of
10	August 19th, you had already discovered that
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	you had the two e-mails from Proctor in your
12	possession, correct?
13	A. That's correct. I had found them
14	earlier.
15	Q. And there was a Schedule A attached
16	to your Notice of Deposition in the Evers
17	case. You recall that?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And you testified earlier that it
20	was your practice to read that prior to
21	coming -- to appearing for the deposition?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And I asked you if you brought any
24	materials with you that were responsive to
25	Schedule A on August 19th. And do you
132
1	recall what you told me?
2	A. I don't. Do you have it written
3	down?
4	Q. Well, you actually offered me an
5	additional copy of your cv. we had just
6	done the Willis deposition prior to that and
7	so you told me you could give me another
8	copy. Do you remember that exchange?
9	A. okay. I don't. But it's been -- it
10	was a busy week. That was also the first
11	week of classes. And, in fact, I seem to
12	recall I had to take a break from that
13	deposition to go teach the first class of
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	the semester, so you hit me at a
15	particularly busy time.
16	Q. True. It was very busy. I believe
17	that was the Willis deposition, we took the
18	break. But do you recall offering me a copy
19	of your CV?
20	A. Yeah. I'm sure I did that. Yeah.
21	That sounds reasonable.
22	Q. And you said you didn't have
23	anything else to produce; is that what you
24	recall?
25	A. Yes. I don't think I produced much
133
1	at that.
2	Q. Now, again, I think I started
3	talking about this before we changed the
4	tapes. August 19th was the first time that
5	you and I had met face to face?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. And I think it's maybe before or
8	after, during the deposition at some point
9	on August 19th, you learned that I had been
10	asking you the questions in the Barbanell
11	deposition on the phone. Do you remember
12	that?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. And during your August 19th
15	deposition in Evers, I specifically
16	mentioned the Barbanell deposition and we
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	talked about the situation with graduate
18	assistants.
19	A. That's right. And I still hold to
20	that position. I've played no role in any
21	of this business at the university of
22	Florida and that is clear.
23	Q. But you didn't provide me with the
24	two e-mails at that time?
25	A. No, I didn't.
134
1	Q. So you weren't completely honest
2	wi th me?
3	A. I don't know about that, where --
4	no. I think I was on the up and up with
5	you.
6	Q. So you knew you had the e-mails from
7	Proctor, correct?
8	A. Forwarded e-mails, that's right.
9	Q. Forwarded e-mails. Exhibits 9 and
10	10. We'll be specific.
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. You knew you had the e-mails at that
13	time, correct?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. And I asked you questions about
16	Proctor and the graduate students on that
17	day, August 19th, yes?
18	A. I think so. I would have to review
19	the testimony to know exactly what I said.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	Q. And you still didn't give me the
21	e-mails at that time. That's true?
22	A. That's right. I don't think you
23	asked me about those issues, about the
24	e-mails or my knowledge of things, but I
25	would have to refresh my testimony before I
135
1	-- my recollection of my testimony before I
2	could answer these questions effectively. I
3	didn't bring that one with me.
4	Q. Well, my question was simply, did
5	you give them to me on August 19th?
6	A. No. I didn't give them to you on
7	August 19th.
8	Q. And you didn't make the decision to
9	tell me that your Barbanell testimony hadn't
10	been entirely accurate at that first Evers
11	deposition?
12	A. Well, my Barbanell testimony was
13	accurate because you asked me if I knew
14	about the issues in the Barbanell trial, and
15	that was true. I mean, I didn't know about
16	these things. I had not -- these were not
17	e-mails that I had, you know, read and
18	incorporated into my knowledge base. So
19	they were just kind of sitting in there.
20	They were forwarded e-mails, for which I
21	played no part in.
22	Q. So you led defense counsel to
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	believe in the Barbanell deposition,
24	including me, that the only communication
25	you had with Dr. Proctor in any way related
136
1	to the graduate students was the one e-mail
2	that you forwarded to Dr. Proctor including
3	Dr. Michel's transcript?
4	A. That's right. And that was my
5	recollection and that was accurate, what
6	you asked me in Barbanell was did you know
7	about these events, and I did not know about
8	those events.
9	Q. And so by August 19th, you knew that
10	your recollection, at the time of the
11	Barbanell deposition, was not entirely
12	accurate. True?
13	A. Well, my knowledge. I mean, my
14	knowledge was what it was during the
15	Barbanell deposition, so I mean, there's not
16	a problem there. That was true and
17	accurate.
18	I discovered that there were these,
19	you know, e-mails in my files, but they were
20	not anything that I had incorporated into my
21	knowledge, had -- in the case of one of them
22	even read, responded to, had authorized. I
23	mean, you know, people send me stuff and he
24	sent me something. And I basically glossed
25	over it.
137
1	So my Barbanell testimony is
2	accurate in that regard. But it didn't seem
3	to be something that occurred to me in the
4	Evers deposition. So that's why I didn't
5	give it to you. it didn't seem to be
6	relevant. I didn't even think about it.
7	when I was asked directly by Mr. Henk, in
8	the later deposition, then I did give it to
9	him.
10	Q. Even though by August 19th, you had
11	already discovered, as we've gone over,
12	these e-mails?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. And we talked about the Proctor
15	situation on August 19th?
16	A. That's right.
17	Q. But you still didn't produce the
18	e-mails?
19	A. No.
20	Q. Do you think you should have
21	produced them at that time, on August 19th?
22	A. No. I produced them when I thought
23	I should have produced them.
24	Q. Did you think about giving them to
25	defense counsel on August 19th?
138
1	A. To be honest with you, it didn't
2	even occur to me because these are much more
3	important to you than they are to me.
4	They're not anything that I acted on or, you
5	know, interacted with. This is -- I,
6	personally, did no action in any of these
7	events, in any way, whatsoever, save for the
8	initial action, which I told you about,
9	which was forwarding another expert's
10	deposition testimony. And I made my opinion
11	on those actions very clear in prior
12	testimony, and so I -- you know, to me, this
13	is something that is unrelated to me. I
14	feel like I'm a bystander in all of this.
15	Q. So on August 19th, it's your
16	testimony that you didn't even think to
17	produce Exhibits 9 and 10 to defense counsel
18	during your Willis or Evers depositions?
19	A. That's right.
20	Q. It didn't even occur to you?
21	A. It didn't even occur to me.
22	Q. So is it a fact that you found out
23	that the e-mails were being subpoenaed from
24	Dr. Proctor that led you to then produce the
25	e-mails at your very next deposition?
139
1	A. Well, I mean, a subpoena is a
2	significant thing. It made me think that,
3	well, I guess this is something, you know,
Page 125
4	important, so, you know, I've got another
5	deposition -- you know, this week's
6	deposition. Here you go. I've got no
7	secrets in that regard.
8	Q. So you marched in and immediately
9	handed defense counsel the e-mails at the
10	beginning of your Koballa deposition on
11	August 24th?
12	MR. QUINN:
13	Objection to the form.
14	A. No. when I was asked about it, when
15	I was asked a question relevant to that, I
16	provided the information.
17	MS. CASE:
18	Q. Did you believe that the e-mails
19	that Dr. Proctor forwarded to you would be
20	e-mails that were produced in response to
21	the subpoena?
22	A. I don't know. I mean, if the
23	University of Florida was required to --
24	which is a public institution, you know, if
25	they were required to give over their
140
1	e-mails, the correspondence between Dr.
2	Proctor and Betty Smocovitis would be part
3	of that. Who knows how much -- I don't know
4	how much they talked. That's not something
5	I have knowledge of.
6	So you are going to get that. I
Page 126
7	can't imagine I gave you something that you
8	didn't have access to. That's not the
9	question. To me, I felt like a bystander in
10	this process who happened to receive two
11	e-mails I didn't even know I had, then later
12	found. And when it became relevant in the
13	deposition, I gave them to you. I didn't
14	think I was giving you anything you didn't
15	have. I was just simply getting rid of what
16	I had in that regard.
17	Q. So you believed we already had the
18	e-mails when you produced them on August
19	24th?
20	A. I don't know for sure what you had,
21	but you probably had them.
22	Q. You believed we were going to get
23	them even if we didn't already have them
24	through the subpoena?
25	A. Not -- probably. I mean -- but that
141
1	didn't really factor into --
2	Q. Certainly, we were going to get
3	them?
4	A. You are asking me questions about
5	the legal process for which I don't know. I
6	mean, I wasn't -- I mean, I've seen no
7	documents related to this, no subpoenas.
8	You know, it came up in conversation. And I
9	said, well, this is -- you know, by golly, I
Page 127
10	found these things. Next opportunity, I'll
11	toss them by.
12	Q. And it was only once you learned
13	about the subpoena that you made the
14	decision to do that?
15	A. Well, I had -- yes. I mean, that
16	would be accurate. I mean, it may be the
17	case that the university of Florida or
18	wherever hired a lawyer and said, no, you
19	can't have these e-mails. That's immaterial
20	to me. I did not want to, as a bystander in
21	this process, have anything that wasn't on
22	the up and up.
23	Q. Have you seen transcripts of
24	Proctor's depositions on June 27th or
25	September 16th?
142
1	A. No. I don't have his -- I don't
2	have that.
3	Q. Have you spoken with Dr. Proctor
4	about either of those depositions?
5	A. No. I haven't talked to him in a
6	wh i1e.
7	Q. Have you talked to him since August
8	21st?
9	A. That would be when I -- the previous
10	identified phone call?
11	Q. Correct.
12	A. No. I haven't talked to him.
Page 128
13	Q. Is that intentional?
14	A. I haven't had anything to talk to
15	him about.
16	Q. Do you still have in your in box the
17	e-mails that you produced, Exhibits 9 and
18	10, or have you deleted those?
19	A. I deleted those after I printed them
20	out.
21	Q. Can you recall specifically when you
22	deleted them?
23	A. No, but I don't have them anymore.
24	But I did give them to you, so I figured I
25	didn't need them anymore.
143
1	Q. Have you received any e-mails from
2	Dr. Proctor since that time?
3	A. No.
4	Q. Have you had any conversations with
5	Dr. Proctor about whether he deleted any
6	e-mails?
7	A. No.
8	Q. You are not familiar with his
9	document retention practices?
10	A. No. I don't -- I don't know that.
11	Q. In any conversation or communication
12	that you've had with Matt Schultz, did you
13	ever give him any reason to believe that the
14	sum and substance of Proctor's activities
15	with regard to the Florida graduate students
Page 129
16	was a five-minute phone call?
17	A. I'm not sure if I follow that
18	question.
19	MS. CASE:
20	Could you read it back, please?
21	(wherein, the question was read back.)
22	A. I can't speak to what Robert Proctor
23	did.
24	Q. I'm not asking you to. I'm asking
25	you if you ever gave Matt Schultz any reason
144
1	to believe that the entirety of Proctor's
2	activities came down to one five-minute
3	phone call?
4	A. No. I never gave him that because I
5	don't have any knowledge of that.
6	Q. And you believe that the process of
7	graduate students assisting professors is
8	perfectly appropriate?
9	A. Yes. we had an extensive testimony
10	about this. Yes. I agree.
11	Q. so you don't believe Dr. Michel's
12	research assistants were doing anything
13	wrong?
14	A. No. No.
15	Q. Now, once you learned that Dr.
16	Proctor was reaching out to Professor
17	Smocovitis, did you think you should do
18	anything to try and stop it?
Page 130
19	A. Well, when I read those e-mails in
20	my possession, I didn't see any unethical or
21	untoward conduct there. I didn't see
22	anything --no. I didn't think to stop.
23	There's nothing to stop. I mean, there's --
24	you know, in your initial inquiry with me,
25	in Barbanell, you mentioned a bunch of
145
1	hypothetical activities which may or may not
2	have happened. I have no knowledge of them
3	either way. But that's not reflected in
4	those e-mails, as far as I recall.
5	And I gave my response to the
6	hypothetical activities in the Barbanell and
7	told you what I thought about the
8	appropriateness and lack of appropriateness
9	of those, and so you can refer back to those
10	earlier answers. I didn't see anything to
11	stop.
12	Q. Did you believe that he was
13	attempting to obstruct Dr. Michel's ability
14	to conduct research in the state of Florida?
15	A. No. I had no -- that never was
16	anything I thought. I mean, that is not
17	anything I thought he was trying to do or
18	certainly not anything I was trying to do,
19	would ever even think to do.
20	Q. Certainly hampering Dr. Michel's
21	access to research assistants could have an
Page 131
22	effect on his ability to conduct expeditious
23	and cost-effective research?
24	A. Well, I don't know that that's what
25	happened. I mean --
146
1	Q. I'm asking you --
2	A. Hypothetically?
3	Q. --if hampering someone's ability to
4	access research assistants could have a
5	negative effect on their ability to conduct
6	research.
7	A. As a hypothetical? Of course, yes.
8	if you don't have research assistants, you
9	don't have as many hands to get the work
10	done, or eyes, as the case may be.
11	Q. Do you consider the e-mails from Dr.
12	Proctor, Exhibits 9 and 10, to be related to
13	your testimony in any Engle progeny case?
14	A. No, not -- none whatsoever.
15	Q. Do you consider that correspondence
16	from Dr. Proctor to be part of your work as
17	an expert testifying for plaintiffs in
18	cigarette litigation?
19	A. It has no bearing whatsoever on
20	that.
21	Q. Do you consider corresponding with
22	Dr. Proctor generally, aside from these two
23	particular e-mails, to be related to your
24	work as an expert testifying for plaintiffs?
Page 132
LKyriakoudes 10012009
25	A. No. with -- and I'll give an
1	exception to that, unless I offer him some
2	-- discuss with him some issues specifically
3	related to litigation, then that would be
4	relevant, but not on the general historical
5	issues of smoking and health.
6	Q. Can you give me an example of what
7	you are talking about?
8	A. Sure. You know, if I -- if Robert
9	said, look, you know -- advised me on some
10	case or something like that or, you know, if
11	he asked for advice on something related to
12	litigation.
13	Q. I'm asking, has that happened?
14	A. No.
15	Q. So the caveat you gave applies to
16	nothing that's happened in actuality?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. Would you consider Proctor's
19	communications with Professor smocovitis to
20	be part of the work of an expert testifying
21	in cigarette litigation?
22	A. No.
23	Q. So that's separate and apart from
24	his work as an expert, in your opinion?
25	A. Yes.
148
1	Q. Now, when you sent Dr. Proctor the
2	transcript of Dr. Michel's deposition
3	transcript, you were at that time a retained
4	expert testifying for plaintiffs in
5	cigarette litigation, correct?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. And at that time, so was he, to your
8	knowledge?
9	A. Right. And, actually, I mean, that
10	would be a communication that was related to
11	litigation because I forwarded him an
12	expert's testimony and so that -- and, of
13	course, that's something I identified to you
14	before.
15	Q. When you received the May 23rd
16	e-mail, Exhibit 9, from Dr. Proctor, you
17	were a retained expert for plaintiffs in
18	cigarette litigation in Florida?
19	A. That's true.
20	Q. And, to your knowledge, so was he?
21	A. Yes. That's right. He's been busy
22	with this, as well.
23	Q. The same question for the June 8th
24	e-mail. When you received the June 8th
25	e-mail from Dr. Proctor, marked as Exhibit
149
1	10, you were a retained expert for cigarette
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	litigation in Florida?
3	A. That's true.
4	Q. And so was he?
5	A. That's correct.
6	Q. You understand that your
7	communications with Dr. Proctor are not
8	privileged, correct?
9	A. Yes. well, ones related to
10	litigation, that makes sense. I mean, I --
11	I'm not a lawyer, so -- and maybe a lawyer
12	would be better to answer that question, but
13	I don't, in my common day-to-day
14	understanding, don't think of it that way.
15	Q. I'm not asking for a legal opinion.
16	I'm asking for your personal belief. You
17	don't believe, when you correspond with Dr.
18	Proctor, that that somehow is cloaked in
19	privilege, do you?
20	A. No. That's not my personal opinion.
21	Q. And it's also your understanding
22	that when you communicate with plaintiff's
23	counsel, that's not cloaked in any sort of
24	privilege, correct?
25	A. That's correct.
150
1	Q. Have you ever been on a conference
2	call with Dr. Proctor and anyone else?
3	A. No.
4	Q. With whom have you discussed --
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	(Off the record.)
6	MS. CASE:
7	Q. Other than what we've already
8	discussed, are you aware of any e-mails from
9	you, to you, to someone else, from someone
10	else related in any way to Dr. Proctor and
11	his activities with regard to the Florida
12	graduate students?
13	A. No. No. That's the sum of it.
14	Q. Did you understand that the two
15	e-mails that Proctor forwarded to you,
16	Exhibits 9 and 10, were part of an ongoing
17	conversation that you had with him?
18	A. No.
19	Q. it was just totally out of the blue?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Did it surprise you when you
22	received them?
23	A. They made no impression on me.
24	Q. Did it seem strange to you that he
25	would be forwarding you those?
151
1	A. No. it didn't seem strange. They
2	seemed to be, at least the first one that I
3	read, e-mails for which required no action
4	on my part. I mean, you know, I go through
5	my e-mails as quickly as possible. And my
6	job, as an administrator, requires me to
7	reply to problems. And this was forwarded
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	material, and I said, you know, this is not
9	anything I need to look at.
10	Q. Do you have any intention of
11	conducting research or publishing anything
12	relating to the work of graduate students
13	assisting expert historians in cigarette
14	litigation?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Do you think that that is a
17	fascinating social phenomenon that should be
18	researched and published on?
19	A. It's -- I've made my opinion clear
20	on these issues. To summarize what I said
21	in Barbanell, this is to the extent that
22	graduate students need to be apprised and
23	have full knowledge of what they're getting
24	into, that's important for them, and their
25	major professors have an obligation to --
152
1	and whomever is employing them in this has
2	an obligation to them to do that, just so
3	they act from a position of full
4	information.
5	But, no, this is not a subject that
6	I would think of having any interest in.
7	It's not something I researched. You know,
8	you can look at my data article to see what
9	I think is important about historians as
10	experts in tobacco litigation. I focus on
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	the methods, the materials they use and the
12	conclusions that they draw from those
13	materials.
14	Q. Have you ever communicated with Dr.
15	Proctor through a third party?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Have you ever asked somebody to send
18	him a message?
19	A. No.
20	Q. How about vice versa? Have you ever
21	received a message from Dr. Proctor through
22	a thi rd party?
23	A. No. No microfilm in pumpkins.
24	Q. I'm sorry?
25	A. No microfilm in pumpkins. Mr. Henk,
153
1	that didn't make an impression on you?
2	MR. HENK:
3	No.
4	THE WITNESS:
5	At the break, I'll explain the
6	story.
7	MR. HENK:
8	is it before our time?
9	THE WITNESS:
10	Yeah, I guess, unfortunately,
11	Whittaker chambers.
12	MS. CASE:
13	We can talk about that later.
14	THE WITNESS:
15	It's for off the record. Sorry. I
16	apologize for that.
17	MS. CASE:
18	Q. Just to wind up this area,
19	professor, when we met in your office on
20	August 19th, you testified during the Evers
21	case that you received some e-mails from --
22	some materials from plaintiff's counsel,
23	depositions, interrogatories, that sort of
24	thing. Do you remember that?
25	A. That's right.
154
1	Q. And you didn't have that in hard
2	copy. You had that electronically on your
3	computer?
4	A. That's right. And then I gave it to
5	you.
6	Q. And you offered to put it on my
7	flash drive after the deposition was
8	concluded. Do you recall that?
9	A. That's right.
10	Q. And after the deposition, you, me
11	and Mr. Geary went back to your office, and
12	you transferred all those files to my flash
13	drive from the Evers case.
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And while we were waiting for those
16	to get copied, we had a conversation. Do
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	you remember that?
18	A. I think we did chitchat.
19	Q. And I thanked you for providing us
20	with that information. You were very
21	accommodating. Do you recall having that
22	discussion?
23	A. Yes. We talked about a number of
24	things.
25	Q. And you said you were happy to
155
1	provide us with the information you had
2	received because there shouldn't be any
3	secrets in litigation.
4	A. That's right. And I believe that.
5	Q. And there shouldn't be any surprises
6	in 1iti gati on.
7	A. I agree. I mean --
8	Q. We discussed that?
9	A. Yes. The thing that I respect about
10	this process is it's -- everyone plays the
11	cards with the cards face up. That's why
12	I've acted the way I have.
13	Q. But it's true, isn't it, that you
14	only turned your cards face up once you knew
15	we were going to get the e-mails from the
16	subpoena?
17	A. Well, I was asked about it. I mean,
18	when I was asked about it, about prior
19	knowledge, I said, well, I have these
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	e-mails, and so I answered truthfully to
21	that. I mean, I -- I mean, there are rules
22	to this process. I respond to your
23	questions.
24	Q. And when we were in your office on
25	August 19th, after the deposition, you were
156
1	copying files from the very computer that
2	you found the e-mails from Proctor on,
3	correct?
4	A. That's right. I received these
5	depositions and documents electronically,
6	trying to save paper, and I presented them
7	to you electronically. And the issue there
8	was there were a number of depositions. I
9	did not have a strong memory of them all.
10	Of course, not all of these depositions are
11	relevant to my opinions. So I skimmed them.
12	But you wanted to know which ones I had
13	received, so that seemed to be the most
14	expeditious way to provide them to you.
15	Q. Right. And while you were copying
16	files on my flash drive, you could have
17	easily have copied the two e-mails you
18	received from Dr. Proctor onto that flash
19	drive, as well?
20	A. Technically, yes.
21	Q. Because you had already discovered
22	them as of that time.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	A. That's true. But, you know, that's
24	not what you were asking me about. You were
25	asking me about another issue in another
157
1	case.
2	Q. And so do you think that that was
3	putting all your cards on the table after
4	that August 19th deposition?
5	A. For that case, yes. I was fair with
6	you.
7	Q. You didn't withhold those two cards
8	that you could have easily provided at that
9	ti me?
10	A. No.
11	Q. Have you followed up with anyone on
12	the outcome of the hearing with the
13	subpoenas or the subpoenas, generally?
14	A. No. I don't know the status of any
15	of that.
16	MS. CASE:
17	Why don't we break for lunch now.
18	VIDEO REPORTER:
19	Stand by. We're concluding Tape 3.
20	The time is 12:11.
21	(Off the record.)
22	VIDEO REPORTER:
23	We are back on the record. This is
24	Tape 3. The time is 1307.
25	MS. CASE:
158
1	Q. Welcome back from lunch, professor.
2	You testified during your deposition in
3	Koballa that you were paid a $3,500 retainer
4	to testify in four to five Volusia County
5	cases, would this group fall into that
6	group you referenced?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. And when were you first contacted to
9	work on the Hibner case?
10	A. I'm not exactly sure the first
11	contact. I know that I began thinking about
12	the Hibner case once we scheduled this
13	deposition a few weeks ago and began
14	reviewing the documents and working on it.
15	Q. So your first time you ever heard
16	about the Hibner case was in the same
17	context as Humpal and Lewis and Koballa; is
18	that true?
19	A. That's right, yes. I got kind of a
20	broad scatter shot of documents and alike,
21	and, in fact, that was part of the
22	explanation for my confusion in the Koballa
23	deposition. I thought I was also being
24	deposed in these cases, as well, which is my
25	error. But -- so I probably got contacted
159
1	at the same time as the Koballa, but didn't
2	begin working and thinking about this case
3	until much later.
4	Q. And so who was the first person that
5	you spoke with about the Hibner or Humpal
6	cases?
7	A. Spoke, in terms of oral
8	communication, I had a phone call with this
9	gentleman here, Mr. Quinn, I'd say about
10	maybe ten days ago, more or less. All prior
11	communication was through the legal
12	secretary or secretary at their office.
13	Q. I think you said within a few days
14	of August 24th is when you first heard of
15	these cases; is that true?
16	A. Yes. That's accurate.
17	Q. When you first had any communication
18	with someone representing the plaintiffs in
19	those four cases?
20	A. That's right. Yes.
21	Q. And so when were you paid the
22	retainer?
23	A. About that same time. I think it
24	would -- it arrived about that same time.
25	Q. Have you worked your way through
160
1	that retainer yet?
2	A. Not yet, no.
3	Q. Have you submitted any invoices or
Page 144
4	bills to plaintiff's counsel for work you've
5	conducted in Humpal or Hibner?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Do you intend to do so?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. When?
10	A. Probably when I'm finished with the
11	case. I'm not sure when the trial is
12	scheduled, is there a schedule for the
13	trial? That's a rhetorical question. If
14	it's within a reasonable amount of time,
15	I'll probably wait until that's over with
16	and just bill then.
17	Q. And so have you already cashed the
18	$3,500 retainer check?
19	A. I did cash that, yes.
20	Q. So any bill that you sent would be
21	for money that you had already accepted and
22	put in your own account?
23	A. Well, I mean, the bill would be for
24	the additional work.
25	Q. My question is a little bit
161
1	different. Will you submit a listing of the
2	work that you've done demonstrating that
3	you've gone through that $3,500 retainer,
4	like a time card?
5	A. Yes. Well, it won't look like a
6	time card, but it will list the number of
Page 145
7	hours that I've worked and it will reflect
8	what I've previously been paid, yes, and
9	then the next due. I guess that's what you
10	are asking?
11	Q. Yes.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And you will do that, as you say,
14	within a reasonable amount of time after
15	trial?
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. Do you know who the defense
18	historian is in the Hibner case?
19	A. I don't.
20	Q. How about Humpal?
21	A. I don't.
22	Q. You said you had a call with Mr.
23	Quinn ten days ago. And was that in
24	relation to both cases or one or the other?
25	A. Both cases.
162
1	Q. What did you discuss on your call
2	ten days ago?
3	A. We discussed logistical
4	arrangements. He told me that he would be
5	coming through Hattiesburg, Mississippi the
6	day before the deposition, and would I be
7	able to find time to meet with him to
8	discuss the case at that time. And we
9	worked out those arrangements.
Page 146
10	(Off the record.)
11	VIDEO REPORTER:
12	We are back on the record. The time
13	is 1339.
14	MS. CASE:
15	Q. We seem to have all the technical
16	difficulties with the phone worked out, and
17	during our break, while we were getting that
18	done, you and plaintiff's counsel and we've
19	discussed that you would, in fact, produce
20	the e-mails that earlier today, you
21	indicated you were unwilling to produce.
22	So we now have those at this time.
23	They've been forwarded to Monica, the court
24	reporter, by you professor, from your GMail
25	account to her AOL account and we can mark
163
1	those Exhibits 3 and 4 to this deposition.
2	COURT REPORTER:
3	I think it's 4 and 5.
4	MS. CASE:
5	Whatever the next in order exhibits
6	are.
7	(Exhibits 4 and 5 were marked.)
8	MS. CASE:
9	Q. The first, just to summarize, just
10	so we know specifically what we're talking
11	about, the first e-mail that you forwarded
12	is from September 23rd, and you sent an
Page 147
13	e-mail to a paralegal, I believe, or a
14	secretary, with Mr. Quinn's firm with regard
15	to the Notice of Deposition that you
16	received to be here today, is that true?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And you were objecting specifically
19	to Number 17 on the document request; is
20	that right?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. And similarly to what you said this
23	morning, you felt it was very broad, the
24	request, correct?
25	A. That's right. I did express the
164
1	content of the e-mail in my earlier
2	questioning. That's right.
3	Q. And you indicated that you had
4	answered extensive questions about the
5	underlying matter and were unwilling to
6	answer any further questions; is that right?
7	A. That's what I said in the e-mail.
8	Q. What was the underlying matter that
9	you are referring to?
10	A. Well, I interpreted item 17 to be a
11	fishing expedition about my work as an
12	expert witness, and in particular, the
13	extensive -- the subject of the extensive
14	discussions we had this morning about
15	Professor Robert Proctor and this Florida
Page 148
16	business, et cetera.
17	Q. So you thought what Number 17 was
18	asking for was, once and for all, any
19	communications you had with Dr. Robert
20	Proctor, you should bring them today?
21	A. No. I interpreted it to mean, once
22	and for all, any communication I have ever
23	had relating to smoking and health, and as I
24	go onto explain myself in the e-mail, I say,
25	you know, this is so broad, it would require
165
1	me to produce things for other cases in
2	other states, in other countries, and in
3	other types of litigation where cigarette
4	companies are not even a party to the
5	litigation.
6	Q. Can you understand how given the
7	experience that we've had with the two
8	e-mails that Proctor sent to you and how it
9	took you a month before you turned them
10	over, how such a broad document request
11	might be necessary in order to cast the net
12	wide enough for you to produce the e-mails
13	in question?
14	A. No.
15	Q. No? Because you were so forthcoming
16	in response to previous Schedule As that
17	asked for communications that you had with
18	-- within which Exhibits 9 and 10 were
Page 149
19	fal1i ng?
20	A. If you want to argue with me about
21	that, that's certainly your right to do so.
22	I don't see a question there. I provided
23	you what I've had and I feel like I've been
24	quite forthcoming and I have no problem with
25	that.
166
1	This seems to be -- I interpreted
2	this request to be excessively broad, and I
3	was concerned that with the set of
4	attorneys, I didn't know if they were going
5	to respond to this or not, you know, if they
6	were going to object to it or not. So then,
7	of course, that's the other part of the
8	e-mai1.
9	Q. in fact, with regard to the notice,
10	you asked to be removed as an expert if you
11	were going to have to comply with Number 17?
12	A. Yes. That would have required --
13	it's, as I said, unconscionably broad, it
14	would have required me to produce things for
15	which no tobacco company has anything to do
16	with, at least no U.S. tobacco company, so
17	it's -- you know, you are not allowed to, as
18	far as I understand it, to go fishing like
19	that in this situation.
20	Now, of course, a judge can review
21	this and he is the ultimate authority on
Page 150
22	these matters. And, of course, I defer to
23	that. I'm no lawyer. But I wanted to put
24	the attorneys with this firm on notice that
25	this was a significant concern to me.
167
1	Q. And aside from the breadth of the
2	request -- well, let me do it this way, in
3	order so the judge can rule on whether
4	that's a proper request and what falls
5	within it should be produced, et cetera, I
6	need for you to describe for me what e-mails
7	you have, e-mails or communications,
8	documents of any kind that are responsive to
9	Number 17 that you haven't brought with you
10	today, if you could describe for me what
11	those are, I would appreciate it.
12	A. Well, I feel like I have, but I'll
13	describe them again. Materials relating to
14	my role as a consulting witness or so-called
15	arm chair witness, well, let me rephrase
16	that. I meant to say arm chair expert,
17	where I have no intention of testifying in
18	person.
19	Q. Understand, I'm not asking for
20	those. Any other categories of materials?
21	A. Well, it wasn't clear to me that
22	that was -- from Item 17 because that
23	relates -- these are all small -- that have
24	some bearing on my expert as a historian of
Page 151
25	the tobacco industry.
1	Q. I'm just trying to narrow down the
2	documents that you may have that could be
3	responsive. So tell me, other than what you
4	just mentioned, what other types of
5	documents, categories of communications,
6	things like that that you have.
7	A. Okay. I mean, are you narrowing it
8	down to things related to Florida, for
9	example?
10	Q. Do you have documents related to
11	Florida that would fall within Request 17?
12	A. As I've described this morning, the
13	documents would be ones that pertain to
14	cases for which there has not yet been a
15	deposition noticed or for which the
16	attorneys may not yet have listed me as an
17	expert. That is things that are in process
18	that may move forward and then reach the
19	point where they will be subject to the
20	normal standard Schedule A. That would --
21	Q. I understand.
22	A. That would be the category of
23	documents that I have.
24	Q. Anything else?
25	A. No. That's it. And I've -- now I'm
169
1	talking about Engle progeny litigation.
2	Q. Correct.
3	A. Yes. That would -- that's all I
4	have in reference to Florida-based Engle
5	progeny litigation, would be things that are
6	in process that have not yet been noticed
7	for a deposition or for which I've not yet
8	appeared for a deposition or for which
9	possibly I've not been listed as an expert
10	on the case.
11	Q. Okay. Any other categories of
12	documents that you can think of that you
13	have in your possession that would be
14	responsive to 17?
15	A. That would be it.
16	Q. Do you have any communications where
17	you sought any kind of advice or anything
18	along those lines from anyone, lawyer, not
19	lawyer, about what to do about Exhibits 9
20	and 10, those two e-mails?
21	A. No.
22	Q. And you agree that such
23	communications would fall within 17 if you
24	had, in fact, had them?
25	A. I don't know. I don't have anything
170
1	responsive to that.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	Q. But if you did, and at some later
3	time it becomes clear that you did have them
4	or that your memory is accurate as of this
5	day or not, you agree that that would fall
6	within Number 17; is that true?
7	A. I mean, I don't know if that's the
8	rule.
9	Q. Or is it not --
10	A. I don't have a problem with it -- I
11	dropped my microphone. I don't have a
12	problem with that idea. I mean, there's --
13	I'm reaching for my microphone as I speak.
14	Q. Hold off until you get your mic on.
15	A. I don't think I have anything
16	responsive to that, but if I did, I wouldn't
17	have a problem giving it to you. So I would
18	agree with you.
19	Q. So you think 17 is broad enough to
20	cover documents that I just described?
21	A. That's right. But my problem with
22	it, just so you are clear, is that it was so
23	broad, it required me to talk about things
24	that are in process, which may come up,
25	things that don't pertain in any way to
171
1	litigation in Florida, things that don't
2	pertain in any way to litigation in which
3	the tobacco industry is a party, formal
4	party to the litigation, but yet issues of
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	smoking and health are relevant, and for
6	things that are happening outside of the
7	United States.
8	Q. Did you, when you drafted that
9	e-mail, believe that it was a privileged
10	communication you were having with
11	plaintiff's counsel?
12	A. That particular e-mail? Oh, I don't
13	know. I didn't think of it either way.
14	when I drafted that e-mail, I wanted to get
15	the attention of whoever it was on the other
16	side of the e-mail.
17	Q. Because you wanted them to object to
18	the Schedule A?
19	A. Well, yes, or if -- or more
20	specifically, I wanted some communication
21	from them. I had had an experience of not
22	very good communication with this particular
23	law firm, and the --
24	MR. QUINN:
25	Not this -- it wasn't this law firm.
172
1	MS. CASE:
2	Please let the witness finish.
3	A. And -- but a similar issue came up
4	in the Koballa case, where I was sent a
5	document that I thought was inappropriate,
6	and so I was unsure who I was dealing with
7	on the other side because I had had very
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	limited contact, in fact, at this point, no
9	contact with Mr. Quinn directly.
10	Q. You also state in that e-mail that
11	you had cc'd other attorneys.
12	A. Yes. And that's included in --
13	Q. Who were those attorneys?
14	A. Well, since -- again, since it was
15	so broad, I thought of, off the top of my
16	head, those attorneys who, if I was required
17	to disclose these documents, they are my
18	communications with them, so I thought of,
19	like, the five or six.
20	Q. who are those people?
21	A. The people that I've been working
22	with now, which would be David Sayles, Matt
23	Schultz, a guy named Lee, David Lee, Verin
24	Smith, people I had depositions scheduled
25	with.
173
1	Q. Anybody else? You gave me three.
2	A. Did I say Howard Acosta? He's on
3	that list. I mean, you could read it off
4	the e-mail. That would be more accurate.
5	Q. it's listed on the e-mail? You
6	carbon copied them? You didn't bcc them?
7	A. No. I cc'd them. You will have
8	those people.
9	Q. So you copied them on the e-mail
10	that you sent to Mr. Quinn's paralegal
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	because you thought that communications you
12	had with them were implicated by this Number
13	17 on the Schedule A?
14	A. Right. And just so that they would
15	be aware of it, an fyi basis.
16	Q. Do you feel as if you are not under
17	an obligation to produce those with regard
18	to -- any such documents in regard to the
19	cases where those particular counsel are
20	representing plaintiff?
21	A. No. No. That's not the rationale.
22	The rationale was that this was, you know, I
23	thought a broad and overreaching fishing
24	expedition. You know, I -- my
25	interpretation of the request was for --
174
1	that you wanted to know much more than you
2	were entitled to, just based on my lay
3	understanding of the process. And given
4	that these were people who I was working
5	with at the time, that I've mentioned, and I
6	think there is a couple of others on there,
7	as well, that just on an fyi basis, they
8	probably should know about that.
9	Q. Are there any documents, in
10	particular, that you are thinking about that
11	you don't want to produce that you think are
12	responsive to 17?
13	A. Yes. I explained those earlier in
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	my previous answer.
15	Q. You explained that it would be a lot
16	of documents, and that you have an objection
17	to that and that they relate to different
18	cases. But is there anything that you are
19	thinking of, specific documents, that you
20	don't want to produce in response to Number
21	17?
22	A. Well, I'll give you classes of
23	documents. I don't think you are entitled
24	to know about my work with other branches of
25	litigation. I state -- I state in the
175
1	e-mail, in fact, the answer to you, that
2	question, is in the e-mail. I answered that
3	very question in the text of the e-mail. I
4	stated that, look, I do a lot more than --
5	I'm involved in other areas of litigation --
6	and I said this a few minutes ago -- that
7	involve other types of venues that are
8	outside of the state of Florida that don't
9	involve tobacco companies as defendants or
10	as any party of the litigation, yet still
11	touch on issues of smoking and health where
12	my expertise is, and, in fact, deal with
13	litigation in other countries.
14	So I interpreted that as it -- it
15	spoke to itself, to me, to be so broad as to
16	require anything I've ever written about
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	litigation. And so those classes of
18	documents that I've just described, that's
19	not your business.
20	Q. Let's call that your breadth
21	objection.
22	A. If you want to call it that, okay.
23	Q. Let's hold that back. Aside from
24	your breadth objection, is there any other
25	reason you don't want to produce documents
176
1	responsive to Number 17?
2	A. No.
3	Q. Then the next document that you
4	forwarded to Monica that she's going to mark
5	as an exhibit to your deposition is an
6	e-mail also from September 23rd, Mr. Quinn
7	responding to you about the e-mail that you
8	had sent him. Yes?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And he indicated that he already
11	knew this was a problem for you. Do you
12	remember that?
13	A. Yes. That's what --
14	Q. What did you think he was referring
15	to? How did you understand that?
16	A. Well, I understood that to mean -- I
17	identified it as a problem, in the ways that
18	I've just described to you, and in the ways
19	I explicitly stated in the e-mail. And I
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	interpreted that to mean that he
21	acknowledged essentially an agreement with
22	me. That was an acknowledgment of my -- of
23	my issue.
24	Q. I don't believe I understand.
25	A. Well, you asked me what I thought he
177
1	meant by that statement.
2	Q. Yes.
3	A. And what I thought he meant by that
4	statement, I think anybody would interpret
5	it to mean that he said, yes, I agree with
6	you and we're going to file an objection on
7	that particular issue. You are right. You
8	know, you are right. You've got a point.
9	We agree with you. You know, you've raised
10	a legitimate issue.
11	Q. well, let's talk about the medical
12	Blosser cigarettes that you've brought with
13	you today. I think we're going to make a
14	copy of the front and back of this and we'll
15	mark it as the next exhibit.
16	(Exhibit 6 was marked.)
17	MS. CASE:
18	Q. Can you tell me where you got these
19	Blosser's cigarettes?
20	A. Yes. I purchased those from an
21	antique dealer through Ebay.
22	Q. How long have you had them?
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	A. I've had them for a few years. I
24	got them a couple three years ago.
25	Q. And these are not tobacco
178
1	cigarettes, right?
2	A. No, they're not. And they state
3	that on the 1abel.
4	Q. Yeah, they do. In fact, they say on
5	the back, in all caps here, that they
6	contain no tobacco nor habit-forming drug.
7	Do you want to check that?
8	A. No. That's -- yes.
9	Q. Do you know when these were sold
10	originally?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. Tell me.
13	A. I've researched Blosser's. That's
14	the only one I have an actual authentic copy
15	of, but I've done research on them. There
16	are advertisements, for example, in my
17	reliance documents from The Atlanta
18	Constitution in the 1920s advertising this
19	particular product, which you guys, of
20	course, have. They're sold from the late
21	19th Century into the 20th Century. I'm not
22	exactly sure when they stopped selling them.
23	I guess it's sometime in the '40s and the
24	'50s.
25	Those, as far as I can tell, based
179
1	on the package design, originate from the
2	nineteen-teens or 1920s, that particular
3	package.
4	Q. So you'd agree that as early as the
5	1920s, it was necessary to write they
6	contain no tobacco nor habit-forming drugs
7	on these medical cigarettes because the
8	public was aware that cigarettes were
9	harmful and could be habit-forming?
10	A. Well, as it's written, it doesn't
11	say that tobacco is habit-forming, it says
12	it has no habit-forming drugs.
13	Q. Such as nicotine?
14	A. Well, I think that's covered in the
15	tobacco. Actually, the proper way to
16	interpret that is there were some
17	cocaine-laced cigarettes that were sold in
18	the late 19th Century. Again, in one of my
19	PowerPoints, which I've supplied to you,
20	there's an advertisement for a brand called
21	cocarettes. And I think that's pretty
22	clear, what they're distinguishing on the
23	habit-forming.
24	The significance of the tobacco
25	part, they are explicitly telling people
180
1	that it does not have tobacco in it, and
2	that is true.
3	Q. So you would say, in your opinion,
4	that, by 1920, use of the word "tobacco"
5	would have conveyed to the American public
6	that there was nicotine involved or that
7	this is ensuring there's not nicotine in the
8	product, just by putting tobacco?
9	A. I don't know -- I don't see any
10	reference to nicotine on that label.
11	Q. well, I think when I asked you, it
12	contained no tobacco nor habit-forming drug,
13	you said nicotine would be included within
14	tobacco.
15	A. No. I misspoke, if that's what I
16	said, that was in error. What I was trying
17	to say was, tobacco -- I mean, since it uses
18	the negative "nor," there's neither tobacco
19	in this, nor habit-forming drugs. And my
20	explanation that I gave a minute ago about
21	the cocarette issue refers to -- that's how
22	I interpret the habit-forming drug part.
23	Q. It's your understanding, correct,
24	that R.J. Reynolds never manufactured a
25	medicinal cigarette; is that true?
181
1	A. Absolutely. That was not
2	manufactured by anybody that's a defendant
3	in this litigation.
4	Q. And that would include Philip
5	Morris?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. And Liggett?
8	A. And Liggett.
9	Q. And Lorillard?
10	A. Lorillard, yes.
11	Q. And as far as you know, R.J.
12	Reynolds didn't sell any cigarettes laced
13	with cocaine, did they?
14	A. No. I've never said that.
15	Q. You threw that out there, so let me
16	just make sure. Reynolds, PM, Lorillard,
17	Liggett didn't sell cigarettes laced with
18	cocaine, correct?
19	A. No. They never did.
20	Q. You're not going to get on the stand
21	and testify to that, correct?
22	A. Well, that would be misleading the
23	jury, if I did.
24	Q. So these Blosser cigarettes weren't
25	manufactured by a tobacco company, correct?
182
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. And do you have any reason to
3	believe that Mr. Humpal ever smoked
4	medicinal cigarettes?
5	A. No, I don't.
6	Q. Do you have any reason to believe he
Page 164
7	was aware of medicinal cigarettes?
8	A. I have no reason to believe that he
9	knew about them one way or the other. I
10	have no evidence either way.
11	Q. would the same be true for Mrs.
12	Hibner, you have no reason to believe she
13	ever smoked --
14	A. The same answers that apply to
15	Humpal would apply to Hibner.
16	Q. Do you know what these do contain,
17	these medical cigarettes, Blosser's?
18	A. I forget the pronunciation. Do they
19	say it's Stramonium?
20	Q. Stramonium?
21	A. Stramonium, which is a medicinal
22	herb.
23	Q. Do you know what it's used for?
24	A. Well, in this case, it's used for
25	the things that they describe on the
183
1	package.
2	Q. Which says for bronchial asthma
3	peroxisomes, hayfever, colds, right?
4	A. Yes. That's right.
5	Q. Do you know that stramonium is an
6	antispasmatic drug used to halt coughing?
7	A. Yes. Yes. And the means of
8	appli cati on i s to smoke i t.
9	Q. And so it's a medicinal herb that
Page 165
10	has those effects, so the way to ingest it
11	would be by smoking it?
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Stramonium also has psychotic
14	effects, doesn't it?
15	A. That, I didn't know.
16	Q. it's a hallucinogen, isn't it?
17	A. I didn't know that. That's
18	interesting. I wasn't aware of that
19	particular characteristic of it.
20	Q. So you know today that, obviously,
21	it would be illegal to sell cocaine-laced
22	cigarettes, correct?
23	A. Oh, yes. It has been since the
24	early 20th Century.
25	Q. Can you tell me whether it would be
184
1	legal today to sell the Blosser's
2	cigarettes?
3	A. I don't know if they're legal to
4	sell right now. I haven't researched that.
5	If you want to ask me the question of why I
6	think that's significant, I'll answer that
7	question.
8	Q. I asked you if it related to Mr.
9	Humpal, correct?
10	A. No. You don't have to go through
11	that.
12	Q. And I asked you if the medical
Page 166
13	cigarettes related to Mrs. Hibner, correct?
14	A. I don't know that they used those,
15	that's right.
16	Q. You don't know that they even had
17	any reason to be aware of them?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. Have you read your expert disclosure
20	in this case?
21	A. I think so. I think it was sent to
22	me-- I think it's the same text as the
23	Koballa. I think that all came to me as
24	kind of one piece and I did read that one.
25	Q. And that would have been within a
185
1	week prior to August 24th?
2	A. Yes. Right. Something like that.
3	Q. Do you know if you saw your expert
4	disclosure in this case before it was filed
5	with the court?
6	A. I don't. You know, people are using
7	the same boiler plate language, but I don't
8	know when it was filed with the court.
9	(Exhibit 7 was marked.)
10	MS. CASE:
11	Q. I'm marking as 7 the expert
12	disclosure in Humpal and I'm handing you
13	that. Mr. Quinn, can we agree that Hibner
14	is the same as Humpal?
15	MR. QUINN:
16	Yes.
17	MS. CASE:
18	Q. I believe you are on Page 13.
19	Looking at Exhibit 7, the expert disclosure
20	here in this case, take a minute to look at
21	that.
22	A. Okay.
23	Q. And you recognize this language?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. This is language you worked up with
186
1	Mr. Schultz?
2	A. That's right, some time ago.
3	Q. So you don't know if you had even
4	heard of the Hibner or Humpal case before
5	this was filed?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. And you don't have a problem with
8	folks disclosing you as an expert, even if
9	they haven't yet spoken with you?
10	A. No. I mean, as long as they get in
11	touch with me and, you know, work out an
12	arrangement with me, I'm okay with it, and
13	as long as they stick to my area of
14	expertise. I don't want to be disclosed in
15	another field. But this is language that I
16	originally wrote and I've testified about
17	that in the past. This has July 7th on it.
18	Q. So, to your knowledge, you had not
Page 168
19	spoken to anyone about the Hibner or Humpal
20	cases prior to July 7, correct?
21	A. That's right.
22	Q. Let's talk about the first
23	paragraph, which appears on Page 13. is it
24	fair to say that this first paragraph
25	describes opinions you have that aren't
187
1	specific to any plaintiff?
2	A. Yes. That would be accurate, yes.
3	Q. And then the second paragraph refers
4	to some testimony you may give with regard
5	to where a particular plaintiff may have
6	lived?
7	A. That's right.
8	Q. Would you agree that your opinions
9	in the Hibner case are generally consistent
10	with the testimony you gave at trial in
11	Hess, Sherman, Barbanell, Campbell, Martin?
12	A. Ferlanti.
13	Q. Ferlanti.
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And would you agree that your
16	opinions for the Humpal case would be
17	generally consistent with the testimony you
18	gave in Hess, Sherman, Ferlanti, Martin,
19	Campbell and Barbanell?
20	A. Yes. I anticipate sticking to those
21	general areas and I don't anticipate
Page 169
22	changing my opinions. I mean, history
23	hasn't changed.
24	MS. CASE:
25	Let's change the tape.
188
1	VIDEO REPORTER:
2	Stand by. we're going off the
3	record. The time is 1404.
4	(Off the record.)
5	VIDEO REPORTER:
6	We are back on the record. This is
7	Tape 4 in the deposition of Louis
8	Kyriakoudes. The time is 1406.
9	MS. CASE:
10	Q. Because Dr. Kyriakoudes would like
11	me to ask the question, why are the medical
12	Blosser's cigarettes of any importance to
13	the Hibner and Humpal cases?
14	A. Well, very briefly, they relate to
15	the idea of presentism as a historical
16	phenomenon, which I've explained in my
17	trials and testimony, standard historical
18	concepts.
19	There is an interesting tradition of
20	medical cigarettes, not tobacco, not
21	manufactured by any of the companies
22	involved in this deposition or, I mean, in
23	this litigation, but I think it does
24	illustrate a couple of things. One, first
Page 170
25	and foremost, is from -- to illustrate
1	presentism, we might think today that
2	inhaling smoke is just about the most
3	dangerous thing one could do, into the
4	lungs, and I think that's an accurate
5	judgment, particularly when it comes to
6	tobacco in 2009. But in an earlier period
7	in American history, people saw smoke as
8	something that was positive and you could
9	inhale it. So that's the sum of it. And
10	that's an illustration of an earlier set of
11	values and beliefs.
12	Q. Do you feel better now?
13	A. Yeah. Thank you.
14	Q. You're welcome. Tell me what work,
15	specifically, you've done for the Hibner
16	case.
17	A. what I've done is I've reviewed some
18	of the depositions sent to me. I've been
19	sent the depositions of the family, the
20	family members, and I've reviewed the
21	husband's deposition. I've also reviewed
22	the answers to the interrogatories, and I
23	believe there's an initial one and an
24	amended one, although the amended one was
25	not relevant to my opinions, so that's what
190
1	I've done for Hibner. And my answer would
2	actually be the same for Humpal.
3	Q. So with regard to the Hibner case,
4	you read Mr. Hibner's deposition transcript?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. And you reviewed interrogatory
7	responses and his supplemental interrogatory
8	response?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. And you received other depositions,
11	but you didn't read them?
12	A. I skimmed through them and pretty
13	quickly realized that they would not be
14	useful for formulating my opinions in this
15	case.
16	Q. What do you mean by "useful"?
17	A. That I wouldn't rely on them. That
18	they did not contain information that was
19	necessary for me to rely upon to form any
20	particular plaintiff-specific opinion in
21	this case.
22	Q. And why is that?
23	A. Well, as I've said in the past, my
24	primary interest is locating the plaintiff
25	in historical time and historical place, and
191
1	even with the husband in this particular
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	case, there's nobody that I've looked at
3	that was kind of there when she began
4	smoking, or for that matter, even her youth.
5	So there's just no early information, based
6	on -- in these documents. Everyone seems to
7	have known her later. The husband, it's a
8	second marriage for them, an adult marriage.
9	Q. They didn't meet until the 1980s,
10	correct?
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. So Mr. Hibner can't tell us anything
13	about his wife before the 1980s that he saw
14	with his own eyes?
15	A. Exactly my point.
16	Q. So Mr. Hibner doesn't give you a lot
17	of help in terms of locating Mrs. Hibner in
18	historical time and place?
19	A. No. And in the other depositions,
20	even less.
21	Q. So what about Mr. Hibner's
22	deposition do you rely on for your opinions?
23	A. Well, to be honest with you, there
24	wasn't much in there at all, so almost
25	nothing. Nearly nothing. I mean, he
192
1	mentioned some brand history, but that's
2	about it, you know, when she was born. Some
3	description of a residential history and
4	that's it.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	Q. So the three things that you took
6	from Mr. Hibner's deposition that are
7	relevant to your opinions are when Mrs.
8	Hibner was born, what her brand history was
9	and where she lived throughout her life?
10	A. That's right. And, actually, as a
11	point of fact, those things were also
12	revealed to me in the interrogatories in a
13	much more efficient manner.
14	Q. So the interrogatory responses alone
15	contain the information on which you base
16	your opinions in this case specifically?
17	A. That would be true. That's true.
18	Q. When was Mrs. Hibner born?
19	A. She was born in 1935.
20	Q. And what was her brand history?
21	A. There was a large number of brands
22	discussed. I remember calling Camel, Lucky
23	Strike, Pall Mall, chesterfield. There
24	might have been another mention.
25	Q. Is there anything about her brand
193
1	history that you would feel it necessary to
2	discuss during your testimony?
3	A. Only to the extent in the past, I've
4	shown advertisements, and, you know, would
5	select from a large collection of
6	advertisements, ones from those brands.
7	That would be it.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	Q. And tell me those brands again.
9	A. As I sit here and recall what's
10	listed on the interrogatories, Chesterfield,
11	Lucky strike, Camel, Pall Mall.
12	Q. And so beyond those four brands, you
13	wouldn't find it necessary to discuss any
14	other brands in regard to your testimony in
15	the Hibner case?
16	A. Yes. That's correct.
17	Q. Tell me what you know about Ms.
18	Hibner's residence history.
19	A. Well, she lived a variety of places,
20	was born in the north, Pennsylvania, grew up
21	in North Carolina and Virginia, and then
22	later, as an adult, moved to Florida.
23	Q. And how is that relevant to your
24	opinions in this case?
25	A. Not particularly. I mean, that's
194
1	not the important part of -- that's not a
2	particularly vital piece of information in
3	this particular case, it's something to
4	acknowledge, but it's not -- it doesn't
5	change or shape my fundamental underlying
6	opinions as they're expressed in the
7	disclosure and as I testified many times in
8	the past.
9	Q. So you are not going to do any --
10	you are not going to do any research
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	specific to Virginia, Maryland, any other
12	place you may have lived?
13	A. No. No. I'm not going to read the
14	Waynesville newspaper or -- what was the
15	name of the town outside of the airport
16	where she lived, Glen --
17	Q. Glen Burnham?
18	A. Glen Burnham, yes.
19	Q. You wouldn't find it necessary
20	during your testimony to discuss any of
21	those particular locales?
22	A. No, not in detail, no.
23	Q. In what kind of detail would you --
24	A. I mean, if I'm asked where she
25	lived, I would report back to that, but
195
1	there's nothing particularly special or
2	opinion-changing, if you will, about those
3	residences.
4	Q. So beyond the fact that she lived in
5	a particular place, there's nothing really
6	-- the fact of that, that she lived in
7	Virginia or Maryland, there's nothing
8	specific to those areas that you would find
9	it necessary to discuss during your
10	testimony?
11	A. That's fair. Yes. I agree with
12	that.
13	Q. Let's do Humpal. what have you
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	reviewed for the Humpal case?
15	A. The same types of materials.
16	Q. Specifically.
17	A. The depositions, the
18	interrogatories.
19	Q. whose depositions have you read for
20	the Humpal case?
21	A. His wife. I focused on that. I
22	skimmed the others, but I found the wife's
23	deposition to be the one that I read.
24	Q. What's Mr. Humpal's wife's name?
25	A. Oh, gosh. She's got a long name. I
196
1	thought I read her deposition, if there's
2	no wife deposition, then I didn't read it.
3	I'm not recalling.
4	Q. So you are not sure what deposition
5	you read for the Humpal case?
6	A. Yes. I just skimmed through them
7	because the situation was quite similar to
8	the Hetzner and there didn't seem to be a
9	lot of firsthand knowledge --
10	Q. Did you say Hetzner?
11	A. I'm getting my Hs. I've got so many
12	H cases, they're all running together.
13	Q. It must be tough.
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. So you are not sure what depositions
16	you reviewed for the Humpal case?
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	A. I skimmed them quickly, yes. I'm
18	not recollecting.
19	Q. Can you tell me which ones you
20	skimmed?
21	A. I thought I skimmed the one by the
22	spouse, but if there isn't one by the
23	spouse, then I didn't do that. I'm getting
24	confused with another one.
25	Q. So you can't tell me whose
197
1	deposition you reviewed?
2	A. Right. Yes. That's right. Again,
3	this one, I relied on the interrogatories.
4	Q. It's my understanding there's no
5	wife's deposition. Am I wrong about that?
6	I mean, the daughter is the PR, correct?
7	MR. QUINN:
8	Adelaide. Loss of consortium is the
9	daughter, who is Adelaide?
10	A. Adelaide is the name I --
11	MS. CASE:
12	Q. You haven't read a deposition given
13	by Adelaide Humpal, have you?
14	A. No. There was some mention of her.
15	Q. To my knowledge, she has dementia,
16	is my understanding.
17	A. Okay.
18	Q. Did you garner that from the
19	depositions that you reviewed?
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	A. I didn't. But I wouldn't dispute
21	that. This is an older generation of an
22	individual.
23	Q. So you couldn't say that you
24	carefully reviewed any deposition given in
25	the Humpal case?
198
1	A. Yes. That would be fair. I just
2	skimmed through them quickly. It was clear
3	they didn't have the kind of firsthand
4	information that I was looking for, so I
5	relied upon the interrogatories.
6	Q. So the depositions that you were
7	given for the Humpal case didn't give you
8	much information that you could use to
9	historically place Mr. Humpal in context?
10	A. Right. That added much more than
11	what the interrogatories offered.
12	Q. So the interrogatories are what you
13	rely on for your opinions in the Humpal
14	case?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Can you tell me what you learned in
17	the interrogatories that are relevant to
18	your opinions?
19	A. Again, just basic time and place
20	information, year of birth, 1920,
21	upbringing, Ohio, and mention of the brand
22	history.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	Q. What would the brand history in the
24	Humpal case be?
25	A. As I sit here and recall, Lucky
199
1	Strike, Camel, I believe Merit. Those are
2	the brands that come to mind.
3	Q. Is that why you brought the
4	"Breakthrough!" book today?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. And so the "Breakthrough!" book
7	wouldn't relate to your testimony in the
8	Hibner case, correct?
9	A. Unless she smoked Merit.
10	Q. You have no reason to believe she
11	smoked Merit, do you?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Is there anything about where Mr.
14	Humpal was born and raised that is relevant
15	to your opinions?
16	A. He's a product of the urban Midwest.
17	You know, that's -- you know, there's
18	nothing unique that is opinion-changing in
19	that fact, no.
20	Q. So you haven't done any research on
21	newspapers in Ohio, materials in Ohio?
22	A. No. I've not read the complete
23	paper. Papers, I should say.
24	Q. Were you able to garner anything
25	from the depositions about Mr. Humpal's
1	newspaper reading habits?
2	A. The interrogatory is listed that he
3	subscribed to the Cleveland Plain Dealer and
4	the other Cleveland paper that's now
5	defunct, which I'm not recalling the name
6	of.
7	Q. Cleveland Press?
8	A. That sounds familiar.
9	Q. Beyond his -- the fact that he had a
10	subscription to the various newspapers, is
11	there anything specific about his newspaper
12	reading habits that you find to be relevant
13	in this case?
14	A. No.
15	Q. Wouldn't be relevant to your
16	opinions, I mean.
17	A. Yes. It's not relevant to my
18	opinions.
19	Q. I misspoke. Have you spoken with
20	any family members of either Mrs. Hibner or
21	Mr. Humpal?
22	A. No.
23	Q. You haven't looked at any medical
24	records?
25	A. No.
1	Q. You haven't seen anything written by
2	either one of them, journals, diary, that
3	kind of thing?
4	A. No. I haven't looked at any of
5	that.
6	Q. You haven't looked at any education
7	records for Mr. Humpal or Mrs. Hibner?
8	A. No.
9	Q. You haven't looked at any employment
10	records for Mr. Humpal or Mrs. Hibner?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Are their occupations relevant to
13	your opinions in any way?
14	A. No.
15	Q. So, for example, if Mrs. Hibner was
16	an x-ray technician at a pulmonologist's
17	office, that wouldn't be relevant to your
18	opinion?
19	A. No.
20	Q. You agree that based on their
21	employment history, people can gain
22	different experiences about their knowledge
23	and beliefs about the risks of smoking?
24	A. in special situations, that's
25	possible.
202
1	Q. So, for instance, if a smoker worked
2	at the office of a cancer researcher, that
3	smoker might be exposed to more information
Page 182
4	about the health risks of smoking?
5	A. it's possible, though plenty of
6	healthcare workers smoke, or if they worked
7	in a tobacco factory or grew up in a
8	tobacco-growing area, that might have some
9	relevance. It's hard to say, you know, how
10	that has an effect on a particular
11	individual.
12	Q. But you don't know if Mrs. Hibner
13	worked for a cancer researcher?
14	A. No.
15	Q. And you don't know if Mr. Humpal
16	worked for a cancer researcher?
17	A. No. Or if they worked for a tobacco
18	company in a factory.
19	Q. Would someone who worked for a
20	tobacco company in a factory, would that
21	affect their knowledge and beliefs about the
22	risks of smoking?
23	A. It might have an influence.
24	Q. In what way?
25	A. It might make them less likely to
203
1	believe the science that cigarettes are
2	harmful. I base that on personal
3	experience. People who have worked in those
4	factories have told me so.
5	Q. Is it fair to say that you would
6	expect your direct testimony to include
Page 183
7	references to documents from The Tobacco
8	institute, from the Council For Tobacco
9	Research, Tobacco industry Research
10	Committee or any of the defendants
11	reflecting the various points in time they
12	were disputing claims about the dangers of
13	cigarette smoking?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And the point you would be trying to
16	make with that testimony is that statements
17	and activities by those groups have the
18	effect of creating doubt about the dangers
19	of cigarette smoking?
20	A. Yes, in the mind of the public.
21	Q. Generally, it's true that those
22	documents show that those entities
23	participated in the debate about the risks
24	of smoking, correct?
25	A. Yes. Often, that's the case. I
204
1	guess what you are asking about is the
2	newspaper story, where the man announced,
3	for example, the results of the American
4	Cancer society's epidemiological study and
5	then there will be a response by a tobacco
6	industry official or something along those
7	lines.
8	Q. So a review of the information of
9	that sort would evidence a debate back and
Page 184
10	forth about the risks of smoking before it
11	would have been proven?
12	A. Yes. You could characterize it that
13	way.
14	Q. And you wouldn't characterize the
15	smoking and health debate as one-sided,
16	would you?
17	A. in the public? in the public media?
18	Q. Yes.
19	A. No. The industry made sure that
20	they got thei r message out so that they
21	presented their side.
22	Q. And the other side was presented, as
23	well, correct?
24	A. That's right.
25	Q. I know you always say this, but I
205
1	just want to confirm. You are not a
2	biographer of Betty Jane Hibner?
3	A. That's correct.
4	Q. You can't tell me what Mrs. Hibner
5	saw or read during her life?
6	A. That is correct.
7	Q. You won't testify that she saw a
8	particular advertisement?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. You won't testify that she probably
11	saw a particular advertisement?
12	A. That's correct. I'll talk about a
Page 185
13	general history.
14	Q. You won't testify that she likely
15	saw a particular advertisement?
16	A. I won't use that term.
17	Q. You won't say that she must have
18	seen something similar to a particular
19	advertisement?
20	A. I won't use that language either.
21	Q. And the same would be true of any
22	particular statement from a tobacco company
23	other than an advertisement?
24	A. Again, as I said many times, I
25	can't, based on the thin documentary record,
206
1	tie specific statements to particular
2	individuals at particular points in
3	historical time. I can only talk about how
4	these operate in the broad historical
5	process of formulating general public
6	opinion.
7	Q. Because, from the materials you
8	reviewed, you didn't see any evidence that
9	Mrs. Hibner saw a specific statement from a
10	specific tobacco company, correct?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. And you don't know, similarly, if
13	she ever relied on any specific statement
14	from any tobacco company?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. And you saw no evidence of such
17	reliance?
18	A. That's correct.
19	Q. Similarly, you don't know if she
20	ever heard any statements by any industry
21	groups like CTR?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. And so from everything you reviewed
24	with regard to the Hibner case, you have no
25	basis to conclude that a Reynolds document
207
1	influenced Mrs. Hibner?
2	A. As an individual?
3	Q. Correct.
4	A. No. I've never testified to that.
5	Q. And the same would be true for
6	Philip Morris, Council For Tobacco Research,
7	Tobacco institute, Tobacco Research
8	Commi ttee?
9	A. That's correct.
10	Q. You can't tell us whether Mrs.
11	Hibner ever saw a cigarette ad containing a
12	movie star?
13	A. Well, again, the way I would put it
14	is that the ads with movie stars were
15	ubiquitous, but I don't have positive
16	documentation that she saw a particular ad
17	on a particular day.
18	Q. What do you mean by "ubiquitous"?
Page 187
19	A. Everywhere.
20	Q. So if it was everywhere, Mrs. Hibner
21	had to see it?
22	A. Well, it would be difficult for her
23	to avoid it. It would be difficult for any
24	individual to avoid tobacco advertising
25	during the period of the heyday of tobacco
208
1	advertising, when it was on television,
2	newspaper or in the magazines, on
3	billboards, sky writing, point of purchase
4	sales and all the other places that I've
5	talked about in my testimony.
6	So, you know, I just want to be
7	precise, I'm not going to place Mrs. Hibner
8	in front of a specific ad, at a specific
9	point in time, at a specific place, and that
10	would be true for Mr. Humpal. But I can
11	characterize the ubiquity of pervasiveness
12	of tobacco advertising in American life.
13	Q. So are you going to say that Mrs.
14	Hibner had to have seen some tobacco
15	advertising?
16	A. Well, if asked. I mean, the reality
17	is it would have been very difficult for any
18	individual, any American, let's say -- let's
19	pick a decade that's relevant, you know, in
20	the 1950s, when she was a teenager and
21	becoming an adult, it would have been
Page 188
22	difficult for any individual in the United
23	States to not encounter tobacco advertising
24	on a daily basis. I mean, one would have
25	had to consciously sequester themselves from
209
1	the kinds of activities that we consider to
2	be normal activities, living in normal kinds
3	of places, watching television or listening
4	to the radio, reading magazines or what have
5	you.
6	Q. And you don't know what Mrs.
7	Hibner's activities were, do you?
8	A. No.
9	Q. And you don't know what Mr. Humpal's
10	activities were, do you?
11	A. No. But just so you know about my
12	opinions, I can characterize the
13	pervasiveness of tobacco advertising in the
14	United States.
15	Q. But you can't tell me what Mrs.
16	Hibner or Mr. Humpal ever saw or likely saw
17	or had to see at any point in their lives?
18	A. I can't connect them to specific ads
19	at specific times at specific locales. But
20	to the extent that they were Americans
21	living in the United States and were not
22	sequestered in, say, for example, a convent
23	or monastery, there's a high likelihood --
24	there's nothing secret here. It's a simple
Page 189
25	and very commonsensical judgment, given the
1	pervasiveness of tobacco advertising in the
2	day, at this time, it would have been
3	difficult, nearly impossible for the average
4	American to avoid these messages.
5	Q. You haven't done any research on
6	what ads appeared in the newspapers where
7	Mrs. Hibner lived, have you?
8	A. No. I've looked at national
9	newspapers and some regional papers, but not
10	papers from her particular communities.
11	Q. You haven't looked at what
12	advertising was prevalent in the areas where
13	Mr. Humpal lived?
14	A. In the newspaper, yes. But, again,
15	focusing there on the newspaper. Now,
16	television, radio, national magazines, Time,
17	Life, Newsweek, things like that, I have
18	done extensive research in those areas.
19	Q. And what do you know about Mrs.
20	Hibner's radio listening habits?
21	A. Again, her as an individual, I don't
22	know much. I do know that people listen to
23	the radio in the 1950s.
24	Q. But you don't know about Mrs.
25	Hibner?
1	A. Yes. I'm not going to tie her to a
2	specific message in a specific place at a
3	specific point in historical time.
4	Q. And you don't know about her
5	magazine reading habits?
6	A. No.
7	Q. And you don't know about her
8	newspaper reading habits?
9	A. No. My testimony has always been
10	about the general public and the broader
11	course of American history related to these
12	subjects and I'll stay consistent with that.
13	Q. And, again, you can't tell us
14	whether Mrs. Hibner ever saw The Frank
15	Statement?
16	A. That's right.
17	Q. Do you have any basis to conclude
18	that The Frank Statement had any effect on
19	Mrs. Hibner whatsoever?
20	A. As an individual, I can't tell
21	either way.
22	Q. Presume that all of my questions
23	about Mrs. Hibner or Mr. Humpal, if I
24	identify them in the question, refer to them
25	as an individual.
1	A. Yes. And I'll go back with that,
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	too, to those last five minutes, and so you
3	don't have to redo what you've already asked
4	me because my answers do apply to both.
5	Q. So all the questions I asked you
6	with regard to Mrs. Hibner would apply to
7	Mr. Humpal, as well?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. You can't tell me what ads he saw,
10	correct?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. You can't tell me that any
13	particular document influenced him at any
14	particular time, correct?
15	A. That's right. I don't know either
16	of the plaintiffs' state of mind in this
17	regard; and therefore, will not offer
18	opinions on what I don't know.
19	Q. You have no basis to conclude that
20	any action by a defendant had any effect on
21	Mr. Humpal at any point in time?
22	A. That's correct. Again, I don't know
23	his state of mind. I can only talk about
24	this as a historical phenomenon in American
25	life and the broader American public.
213
1	Q. And the same would be true for Mrs.
2	Hibner?
3	A. Right.
4	Q. You can't tell us what either of
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	them perceived or knew or believed about the
6	risks of tobacco smoking over time?
7	A. Right, as individuals. Again, what
8	I said a moment ago about not knowing their
9	state of mind due to lack of data.
10	Q. Because there really just isn't data
11	available to ascertain what Mrs. Hibner knew
12	when she began smoking?
13	A. I would agree with that.
14	Q. And the same for Mr. Humpal?
15	A. Yes. I would agree with that, as
16	wel1.
17	Q. You can't testify about what would
18	have been reasonable for Mrs. Hibner to
19	believe at any point in time?
20	A. Her as an individual? No. All I
21	can do is, at certain points of historical
22	time, explain what kinds of messages the
23	American public was exposed to, and offer at
24	specific points in historical time, an
25	evaluation of the general state of public
214
1	knowledge on these issues.
2	Q. Maybe it will make it a little
3	easier and we won't have to go back for the
4	other one, so we'll give that a shot.
5	You won't testify what would have
6	been reasonable for someone in the American
7	public to believe about the risks of smoking
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	at any given time?
9	A. No. All I can do is explain the
10	broad shape of public knowledge as a kind of
11	collective entity. You know, and here I use
12	polls, this portion believed this, this
13	portion believed that based on these set of
14	polls, and offering an interpretation based
15	on that.
16	Q. Did you -- I don't know if I
17	specifically asked you. Did you receive
18	depositions for either Hibner or Humpal that
19	you did not review?
20	A. Yes. it was -- I guess it's Humpal
21	for which there's a much larger set of
22	depositions. It's not really a question.
23	But that's an observation. And it became
24	clear to me that none of them were going to
25	supply the kind of firsthand information
215
1	that I described earlier in this line of
2	questioning, and therefore, I just kind of
3	opened them up, went through a couple of
4	pages and said, this is not something I will
5	rely upon.
6	Q. So none of the family members in the
7	Hibner case can offer any insight into what
8	Mrs. Hibner knew when she began smoking?
9	A. Yes. That's true.
10	Q. And would the same be true for Mr.
11	Humpal?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Do you know what injuries Mrs.
14	Hibner has claimed to have suffered?
15	A. I believe that she had lung cancer,
16	and Mr. Humpal, chronic obstructive
17	pulmonary disease. They may have had
18	other --
19	Q. Mrs. Hibner was -- repeat. I'm
20	sorry.
21	A. Lung cancer.
22	Q. Lung cancer. And Mr. Humpal, I
23	believe, is COPD?
24	A. That's right.
25	Q. How is the alleged diagnosis of lung
216
1	cancer, if at all, relevant to your opinions
2	about Mrs. Hibner?
3	A. It isn't. For understanding this
4	historical phenomenon, it's not relevant.
5	Q. And would the same be true for Mr.
6	Humpal and COPD?
7	A. That's true. Correct.
8	Q. If you could summarize for me what
9	case-specific opinions you anticipate giving
10	about Mrs. Hibner at trial.
11	A. As distinct to prior testimony?
12	Q. Pardon me?
13	A. As distinct to my general opinion
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	that I've given --
15	Q. As separate from your general
16	testimony, as you've confirmed would be
17	consistent with your testimony in the past
18	in Sherman, et cetera, what, if anything,
19	would you plan to say about Mrs. Hibner at
20	this trial?
21	A. I can't think of anything. You
22	know, her condition and her situation
23	doesn't change the history. Again, as has
24	been my practice, since she was born in the
25	mid '30s, I would, you know, begin my
217
1	discussion to the context of the rise of
2	smoking in the 1930s, and show
3	advertisements that would be relevant to her
4	position in chronological time, and that
5	would be it.
6	Q. So other than how old she is,
7	there's no specific fact that you would find
8	would be relevant to your opinions?
9	A. That's true. And that same answer
10	would be for Mr. Humpal.
11	Q. So other than Mr. Humpal's age,
12	there's nothing specific that you would say
13	about him in giving your opinions at trial?
14	A. That's correct. I mean, the other
15	-- I mean, one's a man, one's a woman, and
16	so in -- I might talk more about the rise of
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	smoking among women, which is an important
18	historical theme, so that the jury can
19	understand the gendered aspect of that.
20	That would be it.
21	Q. So you aren't prepared to give
22	opinions about the particular places where
23	Mrs. Hibner lived as distinct from the rest
24	of America?
25	A. No. I mean, she lived in a variety
218
1	of places, the southeastern U.S., you know,
2	North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland. You
3	know, those are -- she tended to live in
4	urban places. She didn't grow up on a
5	tobacco farm. So they're very typical for
6	their time.
7	Q. And how about Mr. Humpal, is there
8	nothing about where Mr. Humpal lived that's
9	important to your opinions?
10	A. Not particularly. Again, he was in
11	a significant urban area. You know, his --
12	you know, that's it, really.
13	Q. Do you know what local papers would
14	have been available to Mrs. Hibner
15	throughout her life?
16	A. I'm forgetting the name of the paper
17	in Newport News or Norfolk. I forget which
18	one she lived in. I don't know the name of
19	the paper in her little community in
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	Maryland. So not really. I haven't
21	researched those and they're not important
22	for my opinions.
23	Q. And how about the local -- you've
24	already mentioned the Cleveland Plain
25	Dealer. Any other specific local papers
219
1	that you can tell me were available where
2	Mr. Humpal lived?
3	A. Well, as you reminded me, the
4	Cleveland Press, the now defunct Cleveland
5	Press, but I don't intend to research in
6	those papers.
7	Q. Does the fact that Mr. Humpal read
8	the entire newspaper every day have any
9	significance to your opinions?
10	A. You know, we've already established
11	that I'm not going to put Mr. Humpal in
12	front of a particular advertisement at a
13	particular point in time, as far as my
14	expert opinions go. I'm going to be talking
15	about the broader history, so he read the
16	paper. Many people read the paper. That
17	was a common habit back at that time. That
18	makes him very typical.
19	Q. So it was typical for Americans to
20	read the entire newspaper every day during
21	the time of Mr. Humpal's life?
22	A. Yes. The newspaper habit is
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	something that is changing today, but back
24	in the 1950s, very common for people to come
25	home and read the paper after work, if they
220
1	had an afternoon paper, or if they had the
2	luxury to read it in the morning before they
3	went to work.
4	Q. You've criticized defense historians
5	in the past for overemphasizing smoking and
6	health stories that appeared in the
7	newspaper, would you agree with that?
8	A. Well, I mean, they have to show the
9	full panoply of stories. I mean, the
10	national issue of coverage doesn't really
11	vary much from paper to paper. But, yes,
12	you've got to show both sides.
13	Q. And so you think that they
14	overemphasize and maximize defense
15	historians? You think defense historians
16	overemphasize the importance of stories
17	about the health risks of smoking that
18	appeared in newspapers?
19	A. Well, that's a broad category, you
20	know, and there may be significant
21	variations of the kinds of testimony that
22	your experts give. I mean, a more accurate
23	way to couch my objection in that particular
24	area would be to say that they rely too much
25	on what is in the newspaper at the exclusion
1	of other forms of communication that were
2	available to people, say, in the '50s and
3	'60s, to use time periods. '30s, '40s, '50s
4	and '60s, to use time periods relevant for
5	these two cases. I would feel more
6	comfortable putting it that way.
7	Q. So your criticism would be that they
8	don't use both sides; is that what you are
9	saying?
10	A. Yeah, both sides. But both sides as
11	reflected, for example, in advertising, as
12	well. I mean, what you've really got is not
13	simply a history of information saying
14	smoking was bad for you in the newspaper and
15	magazines, as is typically on the historians
16	that I read, particularly for my study, that
17	was a big part of their testimony.
18	I think a fair and more accurate and
19	historically valid way to do it is to say,
20	look, in terms of public information, we've
21	got messages saying, go smoke, and we have
22	messages saying don't smoke. And you have
23	to take in the totality.
24	If you take just the stories on the
25	issue of smoking and health, well, in fact,
1	you are going to have lots of stories that
2	talk about how smoking might be bad for you
3	as an emerging science. I mean, they call
4	it news because it tells you what you don't
5	know because it's new. But to be fair and
6	accurate, you have to include the broader.
7	it has to be broader, in terms of the
8	sources you look at, and what counts. You
9	have to have acknowledgment of the
10	television advertisements and magazines
11	advertisements and all those kinds of
12	things, point of purchase and billboards,
13	and then make a professional judgment,
14	taking all that into account, on that
15	specific category of evidence. Of course,
16	I've got other criticisms, as well, but on
17	that specific category of evidence, that's
18	how I would characterize it.
19	Q. And you show a lot of advertising,
20	advertising during your testimony?
21	A. Yes. It's important.
22	Q. Do you think you show as much
23	advertising as you do to make up for some
24	perceived lack of advertising in the
25	testimony of defense historians?
223
1	A. NO.
2	Q. You don't think you overemphasize
3	advertising in any way?
4	A. No. Advertising is an important
5	component of how the cigarette manufacturers
6	communicated information about their product
7	to the general public. And as I've said
8	many times, the advertising, not only does
9	it help shape the culture of smoking and
10	health, but in many ways, becomes the
11	culture of smoking and health.
12	Q. What do you mean by that?
13	A. what I mean by that is that people
14	accept the ads as part of their popular
15	culture. Icons like Johnny Roventini,
16	a/k/a, otherwise known as Johnny Philip
17	Morris, were nationally recognized
18	spokespeople, trademark figures who were
19	everywhere. And jokes are made off of them.
20	People play off of them in their humorous
21	monologues. There are references to them in
22	movies and alike. So it becomes part of
23	American popular culture. So the
24	advertising functions on a number of
25	different levels. This is standard
224
1	historical method.
2	Q. What, if any, advertisements would
3	you think you would show during your trial
4	testimony in the Hibner case?
5	A. Oh, what ads would I show?
6	Q. what ads do you think would be
Page 202
7	relevant?
8	A. I think the ads -- I can answer for
9	both cases, here. I would go through and
10	choose from my collection, advertisements
11	that reflect the brands that individuals
12	smoked. So I would choose the major
13	campaigns from the time period in which both
14	of the individuals here were kind of being
15	inculcated into the smoking addiction.
16	Q. Well, there's really different time
17	periods, wouldn't you agree?
18	A. Right. So I could address each one
19	individually.
20	Q. Let's start with Mr. Humpal.
21	A. uh-huh. He would be the earlier
22	one.
23	Q. Born in 1920?
24	A. That's right.
25	Q. Do you have any understanding when
225
1	he began to smoke?
2	A. I don't, but I can rely on -- and
3	I'm not going to make a firm statement as to
4	when he smoked, but we do know, from our
5	social science research on this matter, that
6	most people start smoking as teenagers, 16
7	being the median age.
8	So the world in which he was born
9	into and the context of the world he was
Page 203
10	born into and his attitudes towards smoking
11	were significantly shaped in regards to
12	advertisement during the period of his
13	lifetime, so I would expect to start with
14	the advertisements in the 1920s and take
15	through the '30s, '40s and '50s.
16	Q. So you would presume Mr. Humpal
17	started smoking around age 16, for purposes
18	of your opinions?
19	A. For purposes of my opinions.
20	Q. So that would have put it in roughly
21	1936, correct?
22	A. That's right.
23	Q. What, if anything, should Reynolds
24	have told Mr. Humpal before 1936 about the
25	health risks of smoking?
226
1	A. That they knew in 1936? At that
2	early period, I'm -- that's an interesting
3	question. I've never considered that. As
4	far as R.J. Reynolds goes, I'm not -- I
5	don't have an opinion on the state of their
6	internal knowledge about the risks of
7	smoking and health in 1936. But I'm not
8	sure what they could have told him.
9	All I can talk about is what they
10	did tell him through their advertisements
11	and other public messages and alike and, you
12	know, that's what I can attest to.
Page 204
13	Q. So you won't be testifying about
14	what Reynolds should have told Mr. Humpal
15	before he started smoking?
16	A. I hadn't anticipated that, no.
17	Q. Because, as far as you know,
18	Reynolds didn't have any knowledge that it
19	should have conveyed to Mr. Humpal before he
20	started smoking?
21	A. I'm not aware of anything. Again,
22	though, I'm not completely expert in the
23	full panoply of their medical knowledge at
24	that time period.
25	Q. You've reviewed internal tobacco
227
1	company documents, correct?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. And they extend back in time for a
4	very long time, correct?
5	A. They do, yes.
6	Q. Have you seen ever, in any internal
7	tobacco company document that you've
8	reviewed, evidence of a belief that smoking
9	caused lung cancer prior to 1936?
10	A. No. I have not seen that. That's
11	why I don't intend to offer an opinion on
12	that.
13	Q. So you can't get on the stand and
14	say, R.J. Reynolds should have told Mr.
15	Humpal that smoking could cause lung cancer
Page 205
16	before he started smoking?
17	A. Yes. in this case, I can't, no.
18	Q. How about addiction? Can you point
19	to any internal industry document that
20	evidences knowledge of addiction prior to
21	1936?
22	A. No, I can't.
23	Q. So you can't say that Reynolds or
24	Philip Morris should have told Mr. Humpal
25	that cigarette smoking could be addictive
228
1	before he started smoking?
2	A. That's correct. My position is that
3	people didn't think it was addictive at this
4	time period.
5	Q. And so you can't think of anything
6	that Reynolds or Philip Morris should have
7	warned Mr. Humpal about before he began
8	smoki ng?
9	A. Yes. No, I can't.
10	Q. Let's talk about -- well, before we
11	go to that, Mr. Humpal, it's my
12	understanding he had a collapsed lung in
13	1974. Were you aware of that?
14	A. I'm not. I mean, I'm not his doctor
15	and I'm not going to offer any medical
16	testimony, so that's not something --
17	Q. I'm not asking whether it was true
18	or false that he did, in fact, have one.
Page 206
19	I'm asking if you have any knowledge that
20	that's been alleged, been discussed in this
21	case.
22	A. I have no knowledge of that.
23	Q. Well, I'd like you to assume for a
24	moment that Mr. Humpal had a collapsed lung
25	in 1974. Can you do that?
229
1	A. Sure.
2	Q. My question is, would a doctor
3	treating a patient with a collapsed lung in
4	1974 have advised that patient to quit
5	smoking, in your opinion?
6	MR. QUINN:
7	Object to the form.
8	A. Well, all I can say in answer to
9	that is that there is polling evidence,
10	polling data from the 1970s that tells us
11	that for many smokers, indeed the majority
12	of smokers, when they went to the doctor,
13	they were not getting advice to quit
14	smoki ng.
15	So it's not inconceivable that a
16	physician wouldn't have warned him. But
17	then I'm not a medical doctor. I'm not
18	going to diagnose his condition. But it's
19	not inconceivable that he did not get advice
20	on smoking from his physician, based on the
21	data that I've looked at.
Page 207
22	MS. CASE:
23	Q. That sounds like it's fair to say
24	you don't have an opinion whether he would
25	have been warned one way or another at that
230
1	ti me?
2	A. He, as an individual, no. I mean,
3	all I can say is that, you know, we have,
4	for example, a Harris poll, taken from 1972,
5	where smokers are asked, you know, has your
6	doctor advised you to quit smoking. They
7	asked smokers, two-thirds say, no, he hasn't
8	talked to me about it. So that's all I can
9	say.
10	Q. Okay. Let's talk about Mrs. Hibner.
11	Do you know what year she started smoking
12	cigarettes?
13	A. I don't. Again, for the same kind
14	of mental process that I've used for Mr.
15	Humpal, if she was typical, she probably
16	began smoking, you know, sometime in the
17	early '50s or late '40s.
18	Q. If she was born in '35.
19	A. It would be around '51, '52. We
20	don't know for sure. It's not essential for
21	me to know that. But that context of the
22	'40s and '50s would be important.
23	Q. What, if anything, should Reynolds
24	have told Mrs. Hibner before she started
Page 208
25	smoking cigarettes?
1	A. Well, if -- before she started
2	smoking, if we assume that she began smoking
3	in 1951, certainly, there were things
4	Reynolds could have told her shortly after
5	she began smoking.
6	Q. But not before?
7	A. I'm not aware of things before, no.
8	Q. And when you say "things," do you
9	mean both information about the health risks
10	and the addictive nature of smoking?
11	A. Yes. That's right.
12	Q. So there is nothing that, in your
13	opinion, Reynolds should have informed Mrs.
14	Hibner before she started smoking?
15	A. Well, let me rephrase that just so
16	that I feel more comfortable with the
17	characterization rather than deal with kind
18	of a hypothetical. And, again, you know, I
19	see Reynolds beginning to understand these
20	processes around '53 onward, and largely
21	acting in concert with the other companies
22	in reaction to the bad press. I mean, if --
23	in both cases, if an expert is going
24	to maintain that a plaintiff should have
25	known that this product was bad, I think
232
1	it's a reasonable imputation from that that
2	the manufacturer also knew that it was
3	dangerous and certainly had an obligation to
4	tell them. Now, that's -- I think that's a
5	reasonable position to take.
6	I don't anticipate testifying on
7	that particular issue but, again, if an
8	expert is going to say, I've looked at the
9	history and, you know, everybody knew it was
10	dangerous in 1935 or in 1950, okay,
11	everybody includes the manufacturer. If the
12	manufacturer were to persuade people it
13	wasn't dangerous, that's a problem.
14	But, you know, again, I interpreted
15	your question to mean -- so I'm precise, to
16	mean that a set of documents in which these
17	issues are discussed within the internal
18	files of Reynolds, and for that I'll include
19	Philip Morris in this answer, I have not
20	seen those kinds of documents. They may
21	exist, but I haven't researched them and I
22	don't anticipate giving opinions based on
23	those documents which I haven't seen.
24	Q. Okay. You mentioned 1953, and I
25	think your words -- and correct me if I'm
233
1	wrong -- were Reynolds was beginning to
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	develop an understanding about the risks of
3	smoking as of 1953. Would that be your
4	opinion?
5	A. Well, its relationship to lung
6	cancer.
7	Q. Relationship to lung cancer
8	specifically?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. So before 1953, Reynolds didn't have
11	any such understanding about the
12	relationship of smoking to lung cancer?
13	A. Well, it's hard to say that
14	affirmatively because, I mean, what do they
15	do? They commission Claude Teague to go out
16	and look into the subject essentially, and
17	he puts together a report for the company
18	where he identifies a set of carcinogens
19	that they should be concerned about.
20	Was there no research prior to that?
21	Well, I don't know about the Reynolds
22	company. I've seen information for American
23	Tobacco, which, I guess, in a way, is kind
24	of part of Reynolds now, but they're
25	distinct in my mind as kind of an
234
1	intellectual process, where they are working
2	with the Medical College of Virginia in the
3	1940s on issues related to smoking and
4	health. So certainly, with that company,
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	there's some awareness that there's a
6	problem.
7	And certainly there was scientific
8	research going back to the 1930s on these
9	issues, although a lot of it was not
10	published in the United States.
11	we're getting over to
12	state-of-the-art questions to which I've not
13	testified on in the past, and while I have
14	to answer your question right now, I don't
15	anticipate testifying on at trial, and I'm
16	reaching the frontier of where I feel
17	comfortable intellectually discussing that
18	issue.
19	Q. And I appreciate that. I don't want
20	to go too deep into the specifics of the
21	science, but what I want you to tell me is
22	whether you can point to anything you've
23	ever seen in the files of Reynolds that
24	suggest that prior to 1953 there was any
25	understanding that cigarettes could cause
235
1	lung cancer.
2	A. I have not seen anything, but then
3	again, I have not completely researched all
4	that because I've been focused on the public
5	debate and the role of the industry in
6	shaping the public's understanding and
7	public knowledge.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	Q. So you can't point me to any
9	documents or sets of documents or research
10	prior to 1953 that Reynolds could have
11	disclosed to Mr. Humpal or Mrs. Hibner
12	before they started smoking?
13	A. That's true. But I'm qualifying
14	that, just to let you know, that they may
15	exist in there. I have not done a
16	comprehensive and systematic review of
17	materials to answer that question.
18	Q. But as far as you know, there's
19	nothing?
20	A. As far as I know, but I'm just
21	qualifying what I know. They may be there,
22	but I just haven't made an attempt to find
23	it.
24	Q. okay. Let's talk about the American
25	Tobacco Company. When would you say that
236
1	the American Tobacco Company gained an
2	understanding about the relationship between
3	smoking and cancer?
4	A. Well, I mean, I know that they were
5	-- at least based on the evidence, that they
6	were concerned about health risks of smoking
7	in a quiet way by developing a close
8	relationship with the medical college of
9	Virginia in the 1940s, at least in the '40s.
10	So I think that's evidence that they were
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	concerned, very concerned. So for that
12	particular situation, I have seen evidence
13	to suggest that, yes.
14	Q. You are talking about evidence of
15	concern about the health risks of smoking?
16	A. Concern, yes, and indeed, knowledge.
17	To the extent that they were beginning to
18	see that cigarettes can cause serious
19	disease and began to initiate a program of
20	biological research.
21	Q. When do you think it would be fair
22	to say that the American Tobacco Company
23	knew that smoking caused lung cancer?
24	A. You know, I can't -- you know, I
25	just haven't done the research to answer
237
1	that because, certainly, all of the
2	companies, I think, essentially know there's
3	a problem by 1954. It may go back earlier.
4	But, again, my answer would be the same as
5	the one I gave you for the Reynolds answers.
6	You know, I have not looked at that
7	particular question. I have focused on
8	public understanding and public debate and
9	have not held myself up as an expert in
10	science.
11	Q. So you can't point to anything
12	definite from any tobacco company that
13	evidences an understanding that smoking was
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	related to lung cancer prior to what year?
15	A. I'd have to -- there are more
16	forthright documents. But, again, I don't
17	intend to give an opinion in this area.
18	It's not part of my area of expertise, in
19	terms of evaluating the science. I know
20	that among the industry, certainly by 1957,
21	I think it's widely known in the industry
22	that these things do cause cancer.
23	Later documents -- and I'm not
24	remembering the specific documents -- but if
25	you follow the -- in the Philip Morris
238
1	company, the correspondence of Helmet Wacom,
2	beginning in the late '50s, this is very
3	clear, you know, that he makes his opinions
4	known to the non-technical management above
5	him, the non-scientists that he reports to,
6	in terms of the company leadership.
7	Certainly in the '50s, yes, the industry is
8	knowing -- there are lots of discussions
9	from lots of different perspectives.
10	Q. And so by the time the tobacco
11	industry had an understanding about the
12	relationship between smoking and lung
13	cancer, Mr. Humpal would have been smoking
14	for roughly 20 years?
15	A. Well, less than that, somewhat less
16	than that.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	Q. 15 years?
18	A. Between 15 and 20. But, again, I
19	don't intend to offer opinions on this
20	issue. This is not an area that I have held
21	myself out as an expert in.
22	Q. Do you agree that a person's parents
23	can influence that individual's awareness or
24	belief about the hazards of smoking?
25	A. Sure. That's true.
239
1	Q. what do you know about Mrs. Hibner's
2	parents?
3	A. I don't know anything.
4	Q. What do you know about Mr. Humpal's
5	parents?
6	A. I'm not recalling anything in
7	particular.
8	Q. You agree that a person's spouse can
9	influence an individual's awareness or
10	belief about the hazards of smoking?
11	A. Sure. That's part of the mix.
12	Q. What do you know about Mrs. Hibner's
13	fi rst two husbands?
14	A. Not much. Was she married to both
15	of them? My recollection is -- maybe she
16	was married to both of them.
17	Q. You don't even know how many times
18	she was married?
19	A. Well, there are two men prior to Mr.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	Hibner, but -- and, of course, the children
21	that are the products of his relationship.
22	It's complex. It's a complex family
23	history.
24	Q. And you agree that a person's
25	education can influence their knowledge and
240
1	beliefs about the risks of smoking?
2	A. Yes. And that changes over time.
3	You have to be very careful about locating
4	that in historical time and contextualizing
5	it properly.
6	Q. what do you know about Ms. Hibner's
7	education?
8	A. I believe she went to high school
9	and she graduated from high school. That is
10	mentioned.
11	Q. You don't know anything beyond that?
12	A. No.
13	Q. You don't know where she went to
14	high school?
15	A. Virginia.
16	Q. Beyond that, you can't be more
17	specific?
18	A. No.
19	Q. What do you know about Mr. Humpal's
20	education?
21	A. I'm not recalling.
22	Q. Do you know when Mrs. Hibner's
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	family first got a television set?
24	A. I don't know.
25	Q. Do you know when Mr. Humpal's family
241
1	first got a television set?
2	A. I don't know.
3	Q. Do you know what newspapers,
4	magazines, books were available in Mrs.
5	Hibner's house at any time?
6	A. No.
7	Q. Do you know what newspapers, books,
8	magazines were available in Mr. Humpal's
9	house at any time?
10	A. Well, he mentions reading the
11	Cleveland newspapers, as he mentions
12	earlier. Aside from that, no.
13	Q. I think we've already talked about
14	employment.
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. You don't know what jobs either Mr.
17	Humpal or Mrs. Hibner had, correct?
18	A. No. Mr. Humpal, he worked in the
19	laundry business. That's pretty clear in
20	the deposition. Mrs. Hibner worked in a
21	variety of occupations, including -- I guess
22	assisting with this bar that they owned.
23	Q. Do you know anything about the
24	religious background of Mrs. Hibner?
25	A. No.
242
1	Q. Do you know anything about the
2	religious background of Mr. Humpal?
3	A. No.
4	Q. I think you've testified before that
5	90 percent would be a very, very high level
6	of awareness, if you were to get that
7	response in a poll, correct?
8	A. Well, it depends on what the poll
9	asks. I mean, I think, more accurately --
10	I've usually been asked this in terms of,
11	you know, what would satisfy your definition
12	of common knowledge, which I've testified
13	to, which is what everybody knows, mutual
14	knowledge.
15	Well, at least on a polling
16	instrument, 95 percent, which allows for a
17	normal distribution, two standard deviations
18	from the normal distribution, with some
19	acknowledgment for error, you know, that
20	people didn't understand the question or
21	were distracted or whatever. So 95 percent
22	is as close to totality as you are going to
23	get, in most forms of social phenomena when
24	you measure things, at least in the social
25	science research that I do. It may not be
243
1	good enough for drug research. Every field
2	has its different standards. 90 percent is
3	high, though.
4	Q. So, currently, polls of the American
5	people indicate that they have about a 90
6	percent belief that smoking causes serious
7	disease.
8	A. Well, I mean, I feel more
9	comfortable saying that in the very late
10	1980s and the early 1990s, when the Gallup
11	reasked its standard polling question, which
12	although it changed somewhat in its wording
13	is, do you think cigarettes are among the
14	causes of lung cancer. For some areas, you
15	reach the 90 percent point, either in the
16	late '80s or the early 1990s, and that's
17	very high.
18	Q. But there are still, even though
19	it's very high, there's still some number of
20	people who don't believe that smoking is
21	related to disease in the late '80s and
22	early '90s?
23	A. That's true. And I think it's --
24	you know, just as there are people that
25	continued to smoke. And, in many ways, you
244
1	know, the industry strategy has been to
2	attack just that, to work the margins, you
3	know, of the problem, the margins of the
Page 220
4	market, to probe those areas where people
5	have some level of doubt, to focus their
6	efforts to get more specific segments of the
7	population, to refine their marketing
8	efforts so that they go for the market
9	segments with the greater precision. Yes.
10	It's a fascinating story of the industry
11	learning about its clients over time in
12	response to the challenges posed to their
13	business by the health information.
14	Q. You are not suggesting that everyone
15	who smokes today doesn't know that smoking
16	can cause cancer, correct?
17	A. No. I'm not suggesting that.
18	Q. I must have misunderstood you.
19	MS. CASE:
20	Let's switch real quick.
21	VIDEO REPORTER:
22	Stand by. we're going off the
23	record. This concludes Tape 4. The time is
24	1504.
25	(Off the record.)
245
1	MS. CASE:
2	Q. Professor, we talked before about
3	your St. Petersburg Times research. Have
4	you completed that?
5	A. No, I haven't. I'm not including
6	that in any of my reliance and am not going
Page 221
7	to present it in this case as something I
8	rely upon.
9	Q. Have you completed your research for
10	The Miami Herald that Gary Page asked you to
11	do?
12	A. Yes. I gave that to you all.
13	Q. Do you remember who you gave it to
14	or what deposition it was?
15	A. I thought I gave it to the Barbanell
16	people, but I can -- I don't have a problem
17	giving that to you. I can send you another
18	copy. I'm happy to do that, it's a small
19	set of articles and they're in digital form.
20	Q. If you were to answer the question
21	of what information was available to Betty
22	Jane Hibner during her lifetime about the
23	dangers of smoking, what sources would you
24	use?
25	A. I would say what was available to
246
1	the American public, I would review. The
2	sources I've reviewed, which are a variety
3	of newspapers. Basically, we've long ago
4	reached the point of diminishing returns on
5	this because this is a national issue. The
6	stories are AP stories, United Press, New
7	York Times and other wire services.
8	Look at those. Look at national
9	magazines. Look at television, all mass
Page 222
10	media. I've looked at educational
11	materials. I looked at, you know, points --
12	point to the educational materials. I've
13	looked at etiquette books, and cultural
14	materials like that, looked at film. I've
15	looked at patterns of culture, speaking
16	ways, slang, the things I've talked about.
17	The kinds of things I've talked about in the
18	past, I would stay consistent with that.
19	Q. The question I asked you is
20	information available to Betty Jane Hibner
21	throughout her lifetime, if you were trying
22	to review or trying to get a sense of what
23	that was, would you say that internal
24	tobacco company documents are a part of the
25	universe of materials that were available to
247
1	Betty Jane Hibner during her lifetime?
2	A. No. Those are secret documents.
3	They fulfill another function in my
4	testimony.
5	Q. They don't help us understand what
6	was available to her at any given time?
7	A. Well, there's an exception to that.
8	The industry has -- and I've testified about
9	this -- extensive evidence related to radio
10	and television broadcasts in the 1950s and
11	1960s, lots of transcriptions of news
12	information and things like that that are
Page 223
13	not, at least as far as I can tell,
14	available anywhere else or in any other
15	archive. And so that's an important reason.
16	If you are looking for publicly
17	available information and following that
18	criteria, you still have to consult industry
19	internal files because of the massive
20	records that they kept on radio broadcasts
21	and television broadcasts.
22	Q. Wouldn't -- but that would be
23	limited to those specific broadcasts,
24	correct, broadcasts that aren't available
25	anywhere else that were technically
248
1	available to the American public at the time
2	that they were broadcast?
3	A. That's right. But you've got to
4	have evidence of those broadcasts. And in
5	the '50s, especially before the widespread
6	introduction of magnetic recorded tape and
7	things like that, we just don't have good
8	records of the actual broadcasts, we have
9	some, some TV and some TV news. But you
10	want to augment that with the industry
11	documents. I discussed this in my article
12	with the Grand 'Ole Opry, is where you can
13	go to to get that.
14	Q. According to your CV, you received
15	your Ph.D. in 1997.
16	A. That's correct.
17	Q. And you began working for the
18	University of Southern Mississippi that
19	year.
20	A. Yes. As soon as I graduated, I
21	started working here.
22	Q. So that's been 12 years?
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. When you first started working for
25	the university, what was your job title?
249
1	A. Assistant professor of history.
2	Q. What is your current title?
3	A. Associate professor of history and
4	director of the Center For Oral History and
5	Cultural Heritage.
6	Q. is there a level of professor above
7	associate professor?
8	A. Full professor.
9	Q. So if you were promoted, you would
10	be then called a full professor?
11	A. That's right.
12	Q. when were you first eligible to be
13	promoted to full professor?
14	A. it's five years of service once you
15	are promoted, so that would be -- I guess--
16	I think I was first eligible -- if I had not
17	gone on a two-year leave of absence for my
18	post doc, I would have been first eligible
Page 225
19	last year or the year before, it was
20	something like that. But I took a two-year
21	leave of absence from my position, unpaid,
22	from the university to pursue a post doc,
23	and so I've -- you know, I've -- although I
24	was tenured in the absence of that, I was
25	tenured while I was at the University of
250
1	North Carolina, I believe I -- that set me
2	back a little bit on promotion to full.
3	Q. So when are you eligible to be
4	promoted to full professor?
5	A. I could go now. I could go up for
6	it now.
7	Q. What do you have to do in order to
8	go up for it? Do you have to fill out a
9	form, put in your name?
10	A. it's a pretty big deal. You know,
11	you have to -- I have one book and a number
12	of articles. You have to show, you know, a
13	pattern of accomplishment, according to our
14	tenure and promotion rules, in teaching and
15	service and scholarship, things like that.
16	Q. So why haven't you applied for full
17	professorship?
18	A. Well, one, I had this two-year leave
19	of absence that set me back.
20	Q. But you are currently eligible?
21	A. I am currently eligible.
Page 226
22	Q. So why, as you sit here today, have
23	you not applied for full professorship?
24	A. Previously, I didn't think that I
25	had fulfilled some of the -- some of the
251
1	requirements, particularly on the service.
2	Q. What do you mean by "service"?
3	A. Community work.
4	Q. So as you sit here today, you
5	wouldn't say you are qualified to be
6	promoted to full professor?
7	A. oh, no, as I sit here today, I do
8	think I'm qualified.
9	Q. And so why wouldn't -- maybe I'm
10	misunderstanding you. If you feel you are
11	qualified, why haven't you sought full
12	professorship?
13	A. Well, I didn't think I was qualified
14	last year, and I didn't think I had the time
15	requirement, but I'm going to apply for it
16	this year.
17	Q. You are going to apply for it by the
18	end of 2009?
19	A. Yes. But, you know, it's subject to
20	a vote. You may not get it. At my
21	university, sometimes for full professor,
22	people have to go up for it more than once.
23	I don't know. It's a complex process.
24	Q. What is involved, in terms of how do
Page 227
25	you submit your name?
1	A. Well, you put together a very
2	elaborate portfolio, documenting what you've
3	done, it's voted on at multiple levels of
4	the university, history department, your
5	college, university, the institutions of
6	higher learning, the very top of the
7	university. I got that wrong once. So it's
8	-- you know, it's an elaborate process.
9	Q. Are there opinions that you have
10	about Mrs. Hibner or Mr. Humpal that we
11	haven't discussed today?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Just a couple more questions. The
14	e-mails that you had originally not produced
15	to us this morning that you then produced to
16	us after lunch of your communications with
17	Mr. Quinn and his paralegal, that wasn't
18	exactly about how to use your testimony at
19	trial, was it?
20	A. No. That's why I was clear it was
21	about my testimony.
22	Q. And it wasn't about trial strategy,
23	broadly, those e-mails weren't?
24	A. Well, it was about my testimony here
25	in this deposition, which is part of the
253
1	trial. I mean --
2	Q. It wasn't about how to use your
3	testimony at trial or how to present your
4	testimony at trial? That was not the
5	subject of those e-mails you produced?
6	A. No, not before the jury, but it was
7	how to respond to the testimony.
8	Q. Now, the CD that you produced to us
9	this morning, there are ads on here that
10	you've not produced to defense counsel in
11	the past?
12	A. Well, I wasn't sure. And what I
13	have on there, in kind of an abundance of
14	caution perspective, I sent over -- or put
15	on that document -- I mean, that disk,
16	pardon me for misspeaking, a folder called
17	Commercials because I pulled together a lot
18	of commercials in the last few months.
19	Now, most of those, I used in
20	previous trials, but to be honest with you,
21	I couldn't keep it straight. I don't keep
22	records on that. So just as a -- for me to
23	make sure that I've disclosed everything
24	that I might want to use and given it to
25	you, I put that on the disk. So that's on
254
1	there.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	I had sent to Mr. Quinn my standard
3	generic expert report, which I've given you
4	many times, but I put a copy on there, as
5	well, just for your convenience. And a
6	couple of other things in there that are
7	kind of new. There's an Excel spreadsheet
8	with additional documentation of the
9	showings of an advocacy film called "The
10	Need to Know," "smoking and Health, the Need
11	to Know," which I've shown in past trials on
12	occasion.
13	Q. Can I interrupt you just for a
14	second? I want to let you know where I'm
15	going with the question so we can save a
16	little time. As far as you know, defense
17	counsel may or may not have the materials
18	that appear on this disk; is that true?
19	A. That's right.
20	Q. So if there are materials on here
21	that defense counsel hasn't seen before that
22	defense counsel hasn't had a chance to
23	examine you on, that's a possibility, we may
24	find things we don't have, correct?
25	A. That's true.
255
1	Q. And since this was produced in disk
2	form today, it's not like I can review them
3	at this time.
4	A. I'll make myself available to you.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	Q. And you are willing to do that, as I
6	know you are.
7	MS. CASE:
8	Mr. Quinn, will you also be willing
9	to make him available for additional
10	questions about any reliance materials we
11	weren't produced before today?
12	MR. QUINN:
13	I will, but please keep in mind we
14	have other schedule deadlines in other cases
15	-- well, not in these two. You are well
16	aware of the ones in these two, but we have
17	others, too.
18	MS. CASE:
19	And, certainly, I don't think it
20	would be necessary to pull together a whole
21	other deposition. I'm sure we could tack it
22	on the end of some other examination that
23	had been scheduled. I would be perfectly
24	willing to do that.
25	MR. QUINN:
256
1	That's would be what I would
2	suggest.
3	MS. CASE:
4	Q. I just have one more question. You
5	don't find me intimidating, do you?
6	A. No.
7	MS. CASE:
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	Okay. That's all I have for now.
9	I'll turn it over to Mr. Henk.
10	We're going to mark the CD as
11	Exhibit Number 8.
12	(Exhibit 8 was marked.)
13	A. The intimidation is not in the
14	individual, it's in the broader strategy
15	pursued by the law firm and the client, just
16	to be precise. You, you are fine.
17	EXAMINATION
18	BY MR. HENK:
19	We are on the record, right?
20	VIDEO REEPORTER:
21	Yes, sir, we are.
22	MR. HENK:
23	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, we've met before,
24	right?
25	A. That's correct.
257
1	Q. And just to pick up on the last
2	discussion, do you find me intimidating?
3	A. My answer is the same.
4	Q. You do not find me intimidating?
5	A. You are not, personally,
6	intimidating.
7	Q. Okay. But you mentioned -- do you
8	feel you know what my law firm's strategy is
9	with respect to you?
10	A. Not in its completeness, no, because
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	I'm not privy to your internal discussions,
12	but --
13	Q. I was going to ask that. You have
14	not seen any discussions between counsel for
15	Philip Morris and anyone about strategy with
16	respect to you, have you?
17	A. No. All I've seen is the products
18	of your actions, from which I have to infer.
19	Q. And you haven't seen anything from
20	my client, Philip Morris USA, to or from my
21	client with respect to anything about
22	strategy related to you, have you?
23	A. No. All I can do is infer from,
24	say, for example, your subpoena and
25	deposition strategies.
258
1	Q. I'm not interested in your
2	inferences.
3	Let me ask you, have you done any
4	research as to any Philip Morris documents
5	specifically for the Hibner case?
6	A. Not specifically for Hibner or
7	Humpal.
8	Q. You anticipated my next question.
9	Do you intend to offer any opinions in the
10	Hibner case about Philip Morris USA's
11	conduct that you have not offered in a prior
12	case?
13	A. No.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	Q. And would the same go for the Humpal
15	case?
16	A. Yes. My answer is no for both of
17	those cases.
18	Q. Do you plan to discuss any Philip
19	Morris USA documents in the Hibner case that
20	you have not discussed in prior testimony?
21	A. No. I think my opinions are going
22	to be consistent with prior testimony. And
23	you mentioned that earlier set of cases,
24	when Ms. Case was asking me. So, no, I
25	don't plan to go outside of that.
259
1	Q. Okay. In other words, I heard what
2	you said, but that would also apply to
3	documents specifically, as well, correct?
4	A. Yes. And the underlying documents,
5	that's correct.
6	Q. And the same would go for the Humpal
7	case, correct?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. And then while I'm at it, then, let
10	me ask you about "Breakthrough!" because
11	this book that I'm holding that we have not
12	marked as an exhibit because it's your only
13	original -- this is your original book,
14	correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. And just for the record, the title
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	on the cover of the book says,
18	"Breakthrough! "Merit Presents
19	History-Changing Achievements, 1851 to 1978,
20	As Reported By the New York Times," correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. And where did you get this book?
23	A. That particular one, I bought from a
24	used book dealer, through the internet.
25	Q. And when was that?
260
1	A. That particular copy, I ordered last
2	week because my other copy, I can't seem to
3	locate it. They're widely available and
4	inexpensive. So I had an earlier copy, and
5	I moved my office around a couple of times
6	and who knows where it is.
7	Q. And this "Breakthrough!" book that
8	you've brought with you today, that had not
9	previously been a reliance material of
10	yours, correct?
11	A. That's true, yes.
12	Q. And what is your explanation as to
13	why it became a reliance material now?
14	A. Well, the smoker in this case, in
15	one of these cases actually used that brand.
16	Q. Is there any other reason?
17	A. No.
18	Q. What are the opinions that you
19	intend to give with respect to the
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	"Breakthrough!" book?
21	A. if I'm asked about it and
22	incorporate it into my presentation to the
23	jury, I'll simply point out that the
24	document presents itself as offering
25	breakthroughs and headlines selected from
261
1	The New York Times of what Merit, by
2	implication, Philip Morris, thinks were the
3	most important things that happened during
4	that time period, and then point out that,
5	for example, there was no mention of events
6	that Philip Morris counsel often talks about
7	as being very important, such as the 1964
8	Surgeon General's Report.
9	Q. Do you intend to offer any other
10	opinions about "Breakthrough!"?
11	A. That's it.
12	Q. You don't intend to offer an opinion
13	that "Breakthrough!" provides any false
14	information, do you?
15	A. No. I mean, the headlines in
16	newspaper stories that are reprinted are
17	reprinted accurately in that regard. You
18	know, simply sins of omission would be the
19	issue. But I don't intend to offer that
20	opinion in any case. Simply, it's an
21	example of a Philip Morris communication.
22	Q. And just so we're clear, I'm not
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	referring specifically to headlines. I'm
24	talking about any word you see in this book,
25	whether it's on the front of the cover, the
262
1	back of the cover, any page therein, any
2	print you see in the "Breakthrough!" book,
3	you are not going to opine that any of it is
4	false information, correct?
5	A. Well, false, I don't think along the
6	same terms as you do when I incorporate
7	these into my analysis. To me, what it
8	represents is Philip Morris' attempt at what
9	they thought was the most important and they
10	certainly didn't think the smoking and
11	health issue was most important.
12	So I accept it as their statement of
13	their beliefs. So I accept the document as
14	being a true statement of Philip Morris's
15	position. Much like when I've used in
16	previous trials the Philip Morris youth
17	anti smoking pamphlets. I accept those as a
18	fair and accurate statement of Philip
19	Morris' views. So, no, I'm not going to say
20	anything is false in that.
21	MR. HENK:
22	I'm going to ask the court to strike
23	as nonresponsive everything up to the very
24	last part of your answer, where you actually
25	were responding to my question.
263
1	A. That's fine. That's your job.
2	Q. Do you intend to offer any opinion
3	with respect to this "Breakthrough!" book,
4	any word that's anywhere on it or in it,
5	offer the opinion that it's misleading?
6	A. No. No. I'm going to simply
7	present it the way I just described, you
8	know, as a statement of what Philip Morris
9	thought the most important breakthroughs of
10	the time period under consideration there.
11	Q. You referred to sins of omission.
12	What sins of omission do you think Philip
13	Morris committed?
14	A. Well, my personal view is that they
15	-- I guess I would disagree with Philip
16	Morris. I would think the 1964 Surgeon
17	General's Report was a breakthrough, but,
18	you know, that's a disagreement. They're
19	entitled to their view on that. And that's
20	the only -- that's the extent of it. That's
21	what I was referring to.
22	Q. Okay. Anything else?
23	A. That's it.
24	Q. Okay. Could you refer to the page
25	in the book "Breakthrough!" where Philip
264
1	Morris says that that report was not a
2	breakthrough?
3	A. Well, it's not a breakthrough
4	because it's not in the document. That's --
5	Q. I see. You are reading the
6	"Breakthrough!" book to be Philip Morris'
7	representation of every single breakthrough
8	that had ever occurred, do you believe in
9	the United States or worldwide, from that
10	time period?
11	A. Well, they say history-changing
12	achievements. As a point of fact, they have
13	things like Sputnick in here and others, so
14	that would be world history. And simply
15	that, in their position, things that are not
16	in this don't meet their standard of
17	history-changing achievements as reported by
18	the New York Times.
19	Q. where does Philip Morris make that
20	position, do you believe? where do you see
21	that position stated?
22	A. Well, it didn't make the cut.
23	That's all I'm going to say about it. it
24	didn't make the cut.
25	Q. So it's your opinion, Dr.
265
1	Kyriakoudes, that if something doesn't
2	appear in the "Breakthrough!" book, that's
3	Philip Morris' representation that it wasn't
Page 239
4	a breakthrough?
5	A. Not a breakthrough -- not enough to
6	be included in this particular document.
7	And I'm not aware of Volume 2, the update.
8	Q. Do you have any information about
9	how Philip Morris decided what to put in the
10	"Breakthrough!" book?
11	A. No. I can just rely on the
12	document, itself. That's all I have.
13	Q. Okay. So for all you know, Dr.
14	Kyriakoudes, Philip Morris could believe, as
15	of the time they published that
16	"Breakthrough!" book, that there were
17	thousands of other breakthroughs that took
18	place during that time period, but they just
19	decided not to put them in this particular
20	book, correct?
21	A. Yes. I think that's fair.
22	Q. Okay.
23	A. And I wouldn't go any farther than
24	that in my analysis.
25	Q. Did Mr. Humpal see the book
266
1	"Breakthrough!"?
2	A. I have no idea. I cannot answer
3	that question.
4	Q. And so you don't know if Mr. Humpal
5	relied upon anything in the book
6	"Breakthrough!", correct?
Page 240
7	A. My answers would have to be
8	consistent with the lines of question that
9	Ms. Case offered in terms of placing Mr.
10	Humpal and Ms. Hibner in front of any
11	particular document at a particular time in
12	any particular place.
13	Q. Have you seen any polls with respect
14	to the book "Breakthrough!"?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Any reports?
17	A. No. I don't have any other
18	documentation on that particular book.
19	Q. Of any sort, correct?
20	A. Of any sort.
21	Q. So I wouldn't have to ask you
22	studies, articles, I wouldn't have to go
23	through the whole litany? You don't have
24	anything else?
25	A. I have no other documents in my
267
1	reliance set or in my research relevant to
2	that document.
3	Q. In other words, you are not aware of
4	any other documents, correct?
5	A. That's right. Yes. I have not
6	revi ewed any.
7	Q. Do you know if the public health
8	community suggested that tobacco companies
9	market a cigarette like Merit brand
Page 241
10	cigarettes?
11	A. some people did call for safer
12	cigarettes, and so, yes, particularly in the
13	1960s, there were some that were calling for
14	-- '50s and '60s calling for a safer
15	cigarette.
16	Q. And you mentioned Johnny -- what did
17	you call him, Johnny Philip Morris earlier
18	in your testimony?
19	A. Well, his nickname. That would be
20	his nickname.
21	Q. And was there a slogan that you can
22	remember that Johnny Philip Morris would
23	say?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. What was that?
268
1	A. shall I sing it for the camera? I
2	don't think I have the same pitch that he
3	did. "Call for Philip Morris."
4	Q. Mr. Humpal never got that call, did
5	he?
6	A. What do you mean by that?
7	MR. QUINN:
8	Object to the form.
9	A. I don't know what that question
10	means.
11	MR. HENK:
12	Q. He never smoked Philip Morris brand
Page 242
13	cigarettes, did he?
14	MR. QUINN:
15	Object to the form.
16	A. I don't know. Maybe that was the
17	other person involved in this deposition.
18	I'm not aware that he smoked Philip Morris
19	brand, but that's not -- that was a
20	ubiquitous advertising slogan. I would
21	still talk about that, it's critical for
22	understanding the rise of the cigarette
23	market.
24	MR. HENK:
25	Q. When you said that other person
269
1	involved in this deposition, do you mean
2	Ms. --
3	A. MS. --
4	Q. Hibner?
5	A. The other -- yes, this is a double
6	deposition.
7	Q. Well, Mrs. Hibner didn't smoke
8	Philip Morris brand cigarettes, did she?
9	A. I'm not recalling. You know, the --
10	you know, on this whole issue of brand
11	history, particularly for these two cases,
12	the data is very, very sketchy. I mean, the
13	evidentiary base here is very sketchy. We
14	don't have any direct testimony from the
15	individuals, themselves. So --
Page 243
16	And given that there's a wide number
17	of brands discussed for both of the
18	decedent's involved in this litigation, you
19	know, who both began smoking at periods
20	quite distant in modern historical times,
21	it's not an unreasonable position to take
22	that they smoked a wide variety of brands
23	and that the advertising messages of all the
24	leading brands of cigarettes from the time
25	periods of their lives would be relevant for
270
1	my testimony, in terms of the public's
2	understanding of the risks of smoking.
3	Q. You didn't see any evidence that Mr.
4	Humpal smoked Philip Morris brand
5	cigarettes, did you?
6	A. No. But take into account my caveat
7	that I just mentioned.
8	Q. You didn't see any evidence that Ms.
9	Hibner smoked Philip Morris brand
10	cigarettes, did you?
11	A. I don't think so, no.
12	Q. if Mr. Humpal saw a cigarette
13	advertisement of any tobacco company, you
14	don't have any idea whether he relied upon
15	it in any way, do you?
16	A. That's correct. And nor would I
17	present myself as having that knowledge.
18	And you can refer to the previous line of
Page 244
19	questioning relevant to that, that Ms. Case
20	gave, and just about every other deposition
21	I've given.
22	Q. The same goes for Ms. Hibner,
23	correct?
24	A. That's correct.
25	Q. Would you agree that Ms. Hibner was
271
1	an adult in 1974?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. By 1974, cigarette advertisements
4	had been pulled from television and radio,
5	correct?
6	A. Yes.
7	MR. QUINN:
8	I'm going to object to the form.
9	Sorry. I didn't get it out in time.
10	A. Actually pulled off a little sooner
11	than that, pulled off of TV, '71.
12	MR. HENK:
13	Q. Right. Which would be before '74,
14	right?
15	A. Right.
16	Q. You would agree that Mr. Humpal was
17	an adult in 1980?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. in fact, he would have been about
20	60.
21	A. He would have been 60.
Page 245
22	Q. Let me ask about the Blosser
23	cigarettes. And I apologize if I am going
24	over ground we covered. But you didn't do
25	any research to confirm the authenticity of
272
1	this Blosser's -- what would purport to be a
2	Blosser's box of cigarettes, did you?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. What did you do?
5	A. I've looked at similar packaging,
6	the historical archives, and I also have the
7	advertising of the Blosser's brand in my
8	reliance materials.
9	VIDEO REPORTER:
10	Can you put your mic back on?
11	A. Let me restate what I've just said
12	since it probably didn't show up on the
13	recording. What I've said was, I've done
14	research on that very type of package in
15	other -- in archives, and I've seen that
16	same packaging with authenticated
17	documentation in other archives, and I've
18	seen the advertisements in newspapers for
19	that particular product.
20	Q. When did you do that research?
21	A. when did I come across those ads?
22	They had been in my reliance documents for
23	some time. A couple of years ago, maybe
24	even more. It's been a while. If you look
Page 246
25	under The Atlanta Constitution newspaper
1	files, which I've given to you guys, they're
2	in there.
3	Q. Okay. You even remember what
4	newspaper they were from?
5	A. That's right.
6	Q. I'd like to ask you about the
7	e-mails we're going to mark as Exhibits 4
8	and 5. And you will have to forgive me.
9	I'm going to have to step over by the court
10	reporter so that I can look at them while
11	I'm asking you the questions.
12	A. Sure. If you can strive for new and
13	unique questions, I'd be grateful.
14	Q. I think I can.
15	A. Good.
16	Q. I'm not intimidating you standing
17	over here, am I?
18	A. No. I've answered that question.
19	Q. I just wanted to make sure now that
20	I've moved closer to you.
21	MR. HENK:
22	Is Exhibit 4 Dr. Kyriakoudes's
23	e-mail to Mr. Quinn? I'm sorry, to Tammy
24	Todd. Is that Exhibit 4?
25	MS. CASE:
274
1	Yes. I believe Mr. Quinn's e-mail
2	is Exhibit 5.
3	MR. HENK:
4	Q. In Exhibit 4, you specifically asked
5	an assistant of Mr. Quinn to remove you as
6	an expert in these two cases immediately,
7	correct?
8	A. Yes. I was trying to get
9	somebody's attention.
10	Q. Well, I didn't ask you why you did.
11	Let me ask it again, in Exhibit 4 --
12	MR. QUINN:
13	Object to the form. He gets to
14	answer the way he wants to.
15	MR. HENK:
16	Q. In Exhibit 4, you specifically asked
17	an assistant of Mr. Quinn -- and I'm going
18	to quote you -- "Please remove me as an
19	expert in these two cases immediately."
20	Correct?
21	A. That's what I wrote.
22	Q. And Mr. Quinn did not comply with
23	that request of yours, did he?
24	A. No. What was behind that was my
25	sense that they weren't going to object to
275
1	what I thought was a request, as I described
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	it in there, and as I've described it
3	frequently today, overly broad and invasive
4	and not relevant, et cetera. I've talked
5	about that quite a bit today.
6	Q. Are you saying that your request to
7	remove you as an expert in these two cases
8	immediately was for effect?
9	A. Well, the implication was, if they
10	-- I wanted to get somebody's attention at
11	the other end of that line. I didn't know
12	who was at the other end of that line. I
13	haven't had a lot of experience with this
14	group and so I wanted -- I wanted some sense
15	that there would be an objection lodged to
16	what I thought was an overly broad and
17	invasive request for documents, as I've
18	described many times today.
19	Q. Was your statement in Exhibit 4,
20	"please remove me as an expert in these two
21	cases immediately" a false statement by you?
22	A. Well, it can neither be true nor
23	false, it's a request, it's not a
24	statement of fact. How could it be true or
25	false? it's just what it is. it was a
276
1	request. That makes no sense.
2	Q. And when you said in Exhibit 4,
3	"I've answered extensive questions about the
4	underlying matter and am unwilling to answer
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	further questions," what were you referring
6	to specifically?
7	A. The things that we talked about this
8	morning related to this business in which
9	I've been a bystander in regard to the
10	contact with the University of Florida
11	graduate students.
12	Q. In other words, you were referring
13	to the actions that Dr. Proctor took with
14	respect to research assistants, correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. And so, in other words, because you
17	thought you were going to be asked about Dr.
18	Proctor's actions, you asked to be removed
19	as an expert in these two cases immediately,
20	correct?
21	A. No. That's incorrect. You haven't
22	read the e-mail, what the e-mail goes onto
23	say or maybe it says prior to that, I don't
24	have it in front of me, that there's -- the
25	e-mail explains why. And I've explained it
277
1	multiple times today, but I'll repeat myself
2	at the risk of being redundant.
3	it says -- here, up at the top,
4	before I say -- I've got to scroll up a
5	little bit to read the whole thing. I say,
6	"I cannot comply with Item 17 in the
7	Schedule A..." pardon my misspelling there
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	"... Notice of Deposition, it is remarkably
9	and unconscionably broad. To comply would
10	require me to produce privileged materials
11	relating to litigation in cases across the
12	nation and internationally, including the
13	many asbestos cases where I serve as a
14	defense witness on issues of smoking and
15	health." That's the reason.
16	And we established -- and pardon me
17	for expressing a little bit of frustration
18	with this, but we have established
19	extensively, in my the examination by Ms.
20	Case, that that was the issue, and that
21	things relating to Florida, to case
22	materials, Engle progeny litigation, I have
23	no problem with that. But as the thing was
24	written in Item 17, it asks for everything
25	I've ever done, and that was, as I said,
278
1	unconscionably broad.
2	Q. Earlier in this deposition, both you
3	and Mr. Quinn described Exhibit 4 and
4	Exhibit 5 as trial strategy communications,
5	correct?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. Those were not trial strategy
8	communications, were they?
9	MR. QUINN:
10	Object to the form.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	A. Well, no. That's -- not testifying
12	in the trial and not participating in the
13	litigation certainly impacts trial strategy,
14	wouldn't it?
15	MR. HENK:
16	Q. Sir, you have described Exhibits 4
17	and 5 as trial strategy to try and keep from
18	producing them to defense counsel, correct?
19	MR. QUINN:
20	I'm going to object to that. He
21	didn't make any decision regarding that. I
22	did. So accuse me.
23	MR. HENK:
24	That was just a ridiculous speaking
25	objection.
279
1	MR. QUINN:
2	So what? Don't ask him the question
3	then.
4	MR. HENK:
5	So what? You've suggested the
6	answer to him. That's the problem.
7	MR. QUINN:
8	Don't ask him an improper question
9	that you already know the answer to.
10	MR. HENK:
11	Well, we're going to decide what was
12	improper here, I can tell you that. We'll
13	see if the -- if others agree that these
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	were trial strategy communications.
15	A. what I said, and you can go back to
16	the record and read this, as related to my
17	testimony. And I think not testifying is an
18	expression of my testimony. I mean, that
19	certainly is an issue. That's what I was
20	thinking when I said -- I mean, I was quite
21	precise. I was not talking about overall
22	trial strategy. I have no role in that.
23	You know, I wouldn't begin to think that I
24	had the ability to understand how a complex
25	activity for which I have no training or
280
1	experience, like a trial, should proceed. I
2	mean, I'm not a fool.
3	But, you know, precisely that point,
4	you know, at that point in time, if I could
5	be confronted with that kind of broad
6	sweeping subpoena request or Schedule A
7	request, I guess to be more accurate, that
8	impacted the trial, as far as my testimony
9	went. And I was quite clear about that this
10	morning, that pertains to my testimony. And
11	not testifying is a function of my -- you
12	know, that impacts my testimony, me not
13	being there.
14	Q. You testified earlier today that
15	Exhibits 4 and 5 were trial strategy
16	communications to try and cover up the fact
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	that you had asked --
18	A. You are out of line.
19	Q. -- removed as an expert in this
20	case, didn't you?
21	A. You are out of line. Look, I could
22	care less that you see this document. You
23	know, at the request of the attorney here,
24	he wanted to keep that privileged or
25	whatever. But, you know, you are out of
281
1	line in these accusations, absolutely, and I
2	resent it. I resent your unbaseless
3	accusations. I think you are being
4	unprofessional. I think you are
5	misrepresenting what I said this morning on
6	the record. And if you've got a legitimate
7	question, ask your question. Move on.
8	Q. Did you not testify earlier today
9	that Exhibits 4 and 5 constituted trial
10	strategy communications?
11	MR. QUINN:
12	Objection. Asked and answered.
13	A. I said trial strategy as it related
14	to my testimony, and I think that's a
15	reasonable and accurate reflection of what
16	the document says.
17	Look, not participating in the
18	trial, removing myself from giving my
19	testimony, you know, impacts the way one
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	would conduct the trial. And if you can't
21	accept that, then, you know, you are trying
22	to put words in my mouth to make baseless
23	accusations, to impugn my integrity. All of
24	these are false and I resent them.
25	MR. HENK:
282
1	Objection, nonresponsive.
2	A. Fine.
3	Q. if you did not care to have defense
4	counsel see Exhibits 4 and 5, why did you
5	not agree to produce them this morning?
6	A. In discussion with the attorney, he
7	said these are privileged documents, and I
8	relied on his understanding of the process
9	and -- you know, you well know that there
10	was a discussion at lunchtime, I guess it
11	was off the record. You clarified the
12	rules. And once you two attorneys,
13	referring to Mike and you, worked out the
14	details related to the law and what the
15	rules are, then I produced them. I mean,
16	you know, what's -- there's nothing -- and
17	there's nothing more to it than that.
18	Again, you are trying to make something of
19	nothing.
20	Q. Do you have the Koballa deposition
21	transcript in front of you?
22	A. I do.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	Q. You were given an opportunity to
24	read and sign that deposition, correct?
25	A. That's right.
283
1	Q. You chose not to avail yourself of
2	that opportunity, correct?
3	A. That's right.
4	Q. You're not regretting that decision,
5	correct?
6	A. No. I think Monica is a very good
7	court reporter. I think it's accurate.
8	Q. I would like to direct your
9	attention to Page 231 of the Koballa
10	deposition transcript.
11	A. Uh-huh.
12	Q. I would like to direct your
13	attention specifically -- I'm sorry,
14	actually Page 230, Line 16. I asked you,
15	"You believe the situation relative to Dr.
16	Proctor to be a serious one?"
17	And at the end of the answer you
18	gave, the last sentence of your answer, you
19	said, "I mean, a subpoena is a serious
20	matter." Correct?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Okay. The next question I asked
23	you, Page 231, Line 7, "Have you ever had
24	any e-mail communications with Dr. Proctor
25	about this situation?"
284
1	what was your answer at Lines 10 and
2	11?
3	A. Not that I can recall. I don't
4	think so, no.
5	Q. Actually, your answer was, "Not that
6	I can -- not that I can recall. I don't
7	think so, no." Correct?
8	A. Uh-huh.
9	Q. That answer you gave on Page 231 of
10	that transcript, Lines 10 through 11, was
11	not the truth, the whole truth and nothing
12	but the truth, was it?
13	A. Well, the next question that I
14	answered, I did identify the e-mails.
15	Q. No, you didn't, sir. But we'll get
16	into the next two questions.
17	A. The next page.
18	Q. But I'm asking you about this
19	question. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you understand
20	that you are still under oath, correct?
21	A. That's right. That's what I said.
22	Q. Well, that's not what I asked you.
23	Let's try it again.
24	A. And, no --
25	Q. Your answer at Lines 10 to 11, to my
285
1	question that started at Line 7, on Page 231
2	of the Koballa deposition transcript, your
3	answer was not the truth, the whole truth
4	and nothing but the truth, was it?
5	A. Well, in the sense that I had those
6	e-mails, no, that was inaccurate.
7	Q. In fact, that answer you gave at
8	Lines 10 and 11 of Page 231 was a false
9	answer, correct?
10	A. I have the e-mails. That's right.
11	so it was not accurate. But then I later
12	did correct that.
13	Q. And, in fact, when you gave that
14	answer at Lines 10 to 11 of Page 231 of the
15	Koballa transcript, you knew that your
16	answer was false when you gave that answer,
17	correct?
18	A. Well, you know, I had -- I had those
19	e-mails, and I was wanting to give them to
20	you, as I said, later. And as you read the
21	transcript, I basically do identify them.
22	So at that point, yes, it was not accurate,
23	but I did correct that later in the
24	deposition through my actions of identifying
25	them to you.
286
1	Q. That's not what I asked you. I'm
2	going to try it again. Your answer at Lines
3	10 to 11 of Page 231 of the Koballa
Page 258
4	transcript was a knowingly false answer at
5	the time you gave it, correct?
6	MR. QUINN:
7	I object to the form of the
8	question.
9	A. it was not accurate, and I corrected
10	that on the next page.
11	MR. HENK:
12	Q. That's not what I asked you either.
13	Let me try it again. Let me try it this
14	way. At Lines 10 to 11, your answer to my
15	question that started at Line 7 on Page 231
16	of the Koballa deposition transcript, at the
17	time you gave that answer, you knew that to
18	be a false answer, didn't you?
19	MR. QUINN:
20	Object to the form.
21	A. Well, after I gave that answer, I --
22	you know, as we were talking, I realized
23	that I had -- I had to give up these
24	e-mails, and I did realize that I was not
25	accurate and so that's why I corrected it
287
1	very shortly, within probably 60 to 70
2	seconds afterwards.
3	MR. HENK:
4	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you walked into the
5	Koballa deposition hours before you gave
6	that answer on Page 231 of the transcript
Page 259
7	intending to share those e-mails with me,
8	correct?
9	A. I was -- yes. I was wanting to --
10	wanting to relieve myself of those e-mails
11	and I was -- I have to say I was personally
12	embarrassed that I had not correctly
13	recalled all that I had in my e-mail file in
14	the first deposition, and that caused me
15	some stress, and I responded in a stressful
16	manner. It was a very stressful event, as
17	you recall. But I delivered those to you.
18	So that's what happened.
19	Q. It wasn't a stressful event for me.
20	You are referring to yourself, correct?
21	MR. QUINN:
22	Objection. That's not a question.
23	That's a statement.
24	MR. HENK:
25	It was a question.
288
1	MR. QUINN:
2	The end of it.
3	MR. HENK:
4	Then I'll ask it differently.
5	Q. When you just referred to the
6	situation being stressful, you are
7	describing that you were feeling stress,
8	correct?
9	A. Yes. That's what I intended. I
Page 260
10	mean, it's always stressful to be on this
11	side of the table, so to speak. You have an
12	easy job.
13	Q. When you gave the answer that you
14	gave at Lines 10 to 11 of Page 231 of the
15	Koballa deposition transcript, at the time
16	you gave that answer, you knew it to be a
17	false answer, correct?
18	MR. QUINN:
19	Objection.
20	A. As soon as I said it, I realized
21	that I needed to give you those e-mails, and
22	so the next opportunity, within a few
23	seconds, the next question or two, I sought
24	to make that right. That's true. So in
25	that regard.
289
1	MR. HENK:
2	Q. If I keep asking you to answer this
3	question about whether you knew it was a
4	false answer, are you ever going to answer
5	that question?
6	A. I'm giving you the answer, the same
7	answer. I'm answering your question.
8	Q. Well, you haven't answered whether
9	you knew it was false when you gave the
10	answer, and if what you are telling me is
11	you are not ever going to answer my
12	question, then I'm going to ask the judge to
Page 261
13	order you to answer it. I'm not going to
14	waste time here because I've already asked
15	it five or six times now.
16	A. Once I gave that answer, as I said a
17	minute ago, it was -- I realized I had those
18	e-mails and I had to give them to you, and
19	so, yes, I answered the question the way I
20	did. I realized, you know, I've got to give
21	these e-mails up because I have them in my
22	possession and the next opportunity -- and
23	we're talking 30 seconds or so -- I did
24	identify those e-mails to you.
25	Q. And you also realized that at the
290
1	time you gave that answer at Lines 10 to 11,
2	it was a false answer, correct?
3	A. As soon as I said it, I realized it
4	was false, and I sought to make it right.
5	Q. Okay, well, let's talk about the
6	next question and see if you did seek to
7	make it right. The next question I asked
8	you at Line 12, "Dr. Proctor never sent you
9	any e-mails about the situation that led to
10	the documents being subpoenaed?" And why
11	don't you read us out loud what your answer
12	was.
13	A. "He -- no. He's not -- I've had no
14	conversation about any of these hearings or
15	anything with him on e-mails, none of the
Page 262
16	stuff going on in Volusia County with the
17	judge, no e-mails on that whatsoever."
18	And I had no conversations with him.
19	I didn't reply to any of these matters. So
20	that's a true statement.
21	Q. You believe that your answer from
22	Lines 15 to 19 was a true statement, all of
23	it, a true statement in response to my
24	question?
25	A. The statement is true, yes. I had
291
1	no -- I did not reply to these e-mails. I
2	did not discuss it with him in a
3	conversation.
4	Q. okay, well, let's go through the
5	answer because I think you may be thinking
6	that information that was responsive to the
7	question. Let's go through it line by line.
8	A. Sure.
9	Q. All right. When I asked you the
10	question at Line 12, the question was --
11	this is Page 231 of the Koballa deposition
12	transcript. "Dr. Proctor never sent you any
13	e-mails about this situation that led to the
14	documents being subpoenaed?"
15	Now, let's go over the first
16	sentence of your answer. "He -- no." Sir,
17	that answer was a false answer, correct?
18	A. Look, it's a sentence. You've got
Page 263
19	to -- you've got to read the whole thing.
20	Q. I'm going to get to the rest of it.
21	Trust me. I'm just asking you about the
22	first sentence of the answer. When you gave
23	the first sentence of the answer on Line 15
24	of Page 231, that was not the truth, the
25	whole truth and nothing but the truth, was
292
1	it, sir?
2	MR. QUINN:
3	And I object, it's out of context.
4	You need to read the whole answer.
5	A. My meaning of this is what I said.
6	I've had no conversation about him, with him
7	on any of these hearings.
8	MR. HENK:
9	Q. Did you understand my question,
10	starting at Line 12, to be asking about
11	conversations you had?
12	A. That's how I answered it.
13	Q. That's not what I asked you, sir.
14	Are you having trouble understanding my
15	questions today?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Then let me ask it again. My
18	question, starting at Line 12, on Page 231,
19	did you understand my question to be asking
20	about conversations you had with Dr.
21	Proctor?
22	A. No. But that was the answer I gave.
23	That was what my answer was.
24	Q. I wasn't asking about conversations,
25	was I?
293
1	A. No, but that's what I answered
2	about.
3	Q. The part of your answer, starting at
4	Line 15 and ending at Line 19 that referred
5	to conversations, was nonresponsive to my
6	question, correct?
7	A. Yes, but the next question is the
8	follow-up clarification.
9	Q. I know that you want to get to that
10	third question.
11	A. Well, I mean, this is --
12	Q. But I'm the one taking this
13	deposition, so we're focusing on the two
14	questions before it. Now, the first --
15	MR. QUINN:
16	And I want to interpose the same
17	objection that I made earlier, and
18	especially based on your conduct in the last
19	ten minutes. And that is this: This
20	gentleman does not have a lawyer here with
21	him. I am not his lawyer. He was brought
22	here to testify about testimony as an
23	expert. He was not brought here to impugn
24	his veracity for truthfulness because, in
Page 265
25	doing that, it appears to me that you guys
1	are going somewhere else other than simply
2	determining what this man's testimony is
3	going to be and whether it's relevant and
4	whether it is based on bias or not. You are
5	beyond that with these last questions. And
6	you need to understand that, doctor.
7	Now, go on.
8	THE WITNESS:
9	I want to take -- I want to take a
10	break.
11	MS. CASE:
12	If his answers to two out of three
13	questions during his Koballa deposition were
14	false, that's certainly relevant to his
15	being able to comply with the oath.
16	THE WITNESS:
17	I'm going to take a five-minute
18	break since there's no question pending and
19	use the bathroom.
20	MR. QUINN:
21	We can go off the record.
22	VIDEO REPORTER:
23	We're going off the record. The
24	ti me i s 1608.
25	(Off the record.)
295
1	VIDEO REPORTER:
2	We are back on the record. This is
3	Tape 6 in the deposition.
4	MR. HENK:
5	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you decided to take
6	a break during this questioning, correct?
7	A. Yes. I went and used the bathroom.
8	Q. Are you prepared now to answer my
9	questions?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. I'd like to direct your attention to
12	Lines 10 to 11, on Page 231 of the Koballa
13	deposition transcript. When you gave that
14	answer reflected at Lines 10 to 11, you
15	knew, at the time you were giving that
16	answer, that that was a false answer,
17	correct?
18	A. No. After I gave that answer, I
19	sought to correct it later on the next page.
20	I did not intend to give incorrect testimony
21	and that's why I cleared it up later. I
22	mean, not later, but immediately, two or
23	three paragraphs down the page.
24	Q. So when you gave the answer to -- at
25	Lines 10 to 11 of Page 231 of the Koballa
296
1	deposition transcript, your testimony is
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	that you did not know that to be a false
3	answer but you decided it was a false answer
4	after you gave the answer?
5	A. No. I -- look, I've answered this
6	question already. You've asked me this one.
7	I've given my answer. I stand on the answer
8	that I've given. If you are not happy with
9	that answer, you can go to the judge and
10	make a motion, and proceed and go farther
11	with it. But I've answered that. I'm not
12	going to answer any more questions about
13	that particular question.
14	Q. Well, I am going to ask Judge
15	Parsons for permission to have you answer
16	the primary question that you've been
17	refusing to answer, which is whether you
18	knew at the time you gave the answer at
19	Lines 10 to 11 that that was a false answer.
20	MR. QUINN:
21	And I'm stating that he's answered
22	that question probably five times.
23	MR. HENK:
24	Really? What was his answer, Mike?
25	Why don't you summarize it for me?
297
1	MR. QUINN:
2	You've heard it.
3	MR. HENK:
4	No. I would love to hear what his
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	answer was. Did he know it to be a false
6	answer when he gave it?
7	MR. QUINN:
8	You know he didn't. You know good
9	and damn well he didn't. Now, let's move
10	on.
11	MR. HENK:
12	I know the exact opposite.
13	MR. QUINN:
14	That's the reason you keep asking
15	him because that's the answer you want.
16	MR. HENK:
17	And we all know why he doesn't want
18	to admit it.
19	MR. QUINN:
20	That's your thought process, not
21	mine. Certainly not mine.
22	THE WITNESS:
23	Keep your gratuitous remarks to
24	yourself. Ask me a question on the record
25	and I'll work with that, but the
298
1	editorializing, I don't appreciate.
2	MR. HENK:
3	I was talking to Mr. Quinn. I
4	wasn't speaking to you.
5	Q. Let's direct your attention to the
6	first sentence of your answer at Line 15,
7	and the question I asked, starting at Line
LKyriakoudes 10012009
8	12 on Page 231 of the Koballa deposition
9	transcript. The first sentence of your
10	answer, "He -- no," that answer was not the
11	truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
12	truth, correct?
13	A. I've answered that question already.
14	I'm not going to answer it again. If you
15	again want to go to the judge to compel me
16	to answer the question, I'm happy to go
17	through that process. But I've already
18	answered that. I'm not going to answer it
19	agai n.
20	MR. HENK:
21	Let the record reflect that no
22	objection was stated by counsel to the
23	question and Dr. Kyriakoudes is refusing to
24	answer the question because it was asked and
25	answered.
299
1	MR. QUINN:
2	And that's because the question has
3	been objected to previously, and if you need
4	another objection, then I will make another
5	objection.
6	Q. Let's focus now on the last line.
7	That would be Line 19 of your answer to my
8	question, starting at Line 12.
9	A. what page are you on?
10	Q. That would be the same page we've
LKyriakoudes 10012009
11	been talking about for the last ten minutes,
12	Page 231. You do have Page 231 of the
13	Koballa deposition transcript in front of
14	you?
15	A. Yes. I thought you were moving to
16	the next page.
17	Q. No.
18	A. Okay.
19	Q. I'd like to focus on Line 19 of Page
20	231. The last line, last words you gave in
21	response to my question, starting at Line
22	12, was, "No e-mails on that whatsoever."
23	Do you see that?
24	A. Yes. I see that phrase.
25	Q. Did I read it correctly?
300
1	A. You've read that phrase correctly.
2	Q. Your statement in response to my
3	question starting at Line 12, "no e-mails on
4	that whatsoever," was false, correct?
5	A. Incorrect.
6	Q. why do you believe that answer to be
7	a truthful statement, sir?
8	A. Because it's part of a sentence,
9	complete sentence. "I've had no
10	conversation about any of these hearings or
11	anything with him on e-mails, none of this
12	stuff going on in Volusia County with the
13	judge, no e-mails on that whatsoever."
LKyriakoudes 10012009
14	So that applies to what I was
15	saying. I had no conversations on e-mails,
16	and that's true.
17	Q. So, sir, at Line 19 of your answer
18	on Page 231, when you said "no e-mails on
19	that whatsoever," did you mean no e-mails on
20	conversations?
21	A. That's right, no e-mails through
22	conversation. That's what I said.
23	Q. I see. Now, that wouldn't have been
24	responsive to my question, would it?
25	A. That's the answer I gave, and you
301
1	are asking me whether it was truthful, and
2	it was truthful or is truthful, I should
3	say.
4	Q. Do you see the word "conversation"
5	in my question starting at Line 12 and
6	ending at 14 of Page 231?
7	A. No.
8	Q. Why did you answer my questions
9	starting at Line 12 of Page 231 by talking
10	about whether you had conversations if I
11	wasn't asking about conversations?
12	A. Well, that's the answer I gave and
13	the answer is truthful.
14	Q. Sir, I'm asking you why you gave
15	that answer.
16	A. I gave the answer that I gave.
LKyriakoudes 10012009
17	Q. Why did you give that answer?
18	A. I gave that answer because I thought
19	that was a truthful response to your
20	question and that's my answer.
21	Q. Your testimony, as you sit here
22	today, is that every word of your answer,
23	starting at Line 15 and ending at Line 19 of
24	Page 231 of the Koballa deposition
25	transcript was a truthful statement?
302
1	A. Yes. I was talking about a
2	conversation through e-mail. That's
3	truthful. And then, you know, the next
4	question, you clarify it, and then I tell
5	you the truth. I mean, I tell you the --
6	Q. I know. You have been wanting to
7	tell me about that third question for quite
8	a long time now.
9	Now, when you spoke with Matt
10	Schultz on August 22nd, and you asked --
11	MR. QUINN:
12	Are you not going to give him an
13	opportunity to talk about that part of his
14	deposition testimony? You are going to move
15	onto something else now?
16	MR. HENK:
17	What are you asking me? Are you
18	telling me how to take this deposition?
19	MR. QUINN:
LKyriakoudes 10012009
20	Are you going to let him now tell
21	you that he told you the truth in this
22	deposition about the e-mails or do you --
23	MR. HENK:
24	You mean the third time I asked him
25	after the two times he lied?
303
1	MR. QUINN:
2	How many depositions have you ever
3	been involved in where you say something --
4	you get something wrong and then you get it
5	right again, we don't persecute people for
6	that.
7	MR. HENK:
8	I've never had this situation come
9	up.
10	MR. QUINN:
11	Well, then you haven't been
12	practicing very long, young man.
13	MR. HENK:
14	You can demean me all you want, Mr.
15	Quinn.
16	Q. Let me ask you, Dr. Kyriakoudes,
17	when you had your conversation with Matt
18	Schultz on August 22nd, Matt Schultz told
19	you about the hearing in Volusia County
20	pertaining to the Proctor matter, correct?
21	A. Yes. He mentioned it.
22	Q. And in response to that, you
LKyriakoudes 10012009
23	mentioned that you had the two e-mails,
24	Exhibits 9 and 10 to this deposition,
25	correct?
304
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. You said that in response to what
3	Mr. Schultz told you, correct?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. I'd like to direct your attention to
6	Pages 164 to 165 of the Koballa deposition
7	transcript. And I'm going to start reading
8	at Page 164, Line 3. And would you follow
9	along and let me know if I've read anything
10	incorrectly?
11	A. Uh-huh.
12	Q. Starting at Page 164, Line 3 of the
13	Koballa deposition transcript, question:
14	"Okay. Are you familiar with Dr. Proctor's
15	contacts with a professor at the University
16	of Florida?"
17	Answer: "I am now."
18	Question: "Okay. Regarding
19	research assistants?"
20	Answer: "Yes. I'm familiar with
21	this and I've had discussions with attorneys
22	who have filled me in with just the basic
23	outlines."
24	Question: "Okay. Which attorneys
25	have you talked to about that?"
305
1	Answer: "Matt Schultz of the
2	Pensacola Levin firm."
3	Question: "When did you talk to
4	Matt about it?"
5	Answer: "He called me this weekend."
6	Question: "What did he tell you?"
7	Answer: "He said that they had had
8	a hearing on Friday and that certain
9	documents were being subpoenaed from Mr.
10	Proctor."
11	Question: "Okay. Did you say
12	anything to Mr. Schultz about that?"
13	Answer, starting at line 24, Page
14	164, running to Page 165, Line 1, your
15	answer was: "I told him that, you know,
16	that's -- I didn't really have any response.
17	It doesn't involve me."
18	That answer you gave, starting at
19	Line 24, Page 164, and ending at Line 1 of
20	Page 165, was a false answer, wasn't it?
21	A. No. That's not false at all. I
22	made no contacts with anybody related to
23	this. I took no actions on this. I was
24	simply a bystander. And that's why I'm not
25	responsible for any of it and have no
306
1	involvement in it in that regard.
2	Q. Ms. Lawson didn't ask you that in
3	her question, did she?
4	A. she was asking me about that part of
5	the conversation and that's true. I mean, I
6	-- you know, I didn't do anything, make any
7	contacts with the University of Florida or
8	any of those activities, which were the
9	reason why this subpoena had been issued for
10	Mr. Proctor.
11	Q. Well, let's focus on Ms. Lawson's
12	question because that's not what she was
13	asking you. Ms. Lawson's question, starting
14	at Line 22, Page 164, was question: "Okay.
15	Did you say anything to Mr. Schultz about
16	that?"
17	A truthful answer would have been,
18	yes?
19	MR. QUINN:
20	Object to the form.
21	MR. HENK:
22	Q. I did say something to Mr. Schultz
23	about that, correct?
24	MR. QUINN:
25	Object to the form.
307
1	A. No. I didn't think it involved me
2	because I had not done any actions on that.
3	I'm simply a bystander on this. That's my
Page 277
4	answer. Take it to the judge.
5	MR. HENK:
6	Q. Are you refusing to answer more
7	questions about this question and your
8	answer?
9	A. I think I'm going to stop on this
10	entire line of questioning.
11	MR. QUINN:
12	That is strictly up to you.
13	MS. CASE:
14	I still have follow-up questions, to
15	the extent that that needs to be stated, if
16	Dr. Kyriakoudes is shutting down the
17	deposition.
18	MR. HENK:
19	Is that what's happening?
20	MR. QUINN:
21	Well, it's beyond the scope, totally
22	and completely. It also involves testimony
23	in a case that I am not counsel in and
24	there's nobody from -- in that case present
25	here today who was at that deposition in any
308
1	way to defend what was said and what was
2	answered.
3	This is totally a one-sided assault,
4	and so I think that it is perfectly within
5	his purview, because I can't represent him
6	and I don't represent him, that if he thinks
Page 278
7	that you've gone far afield, yes, he can
8	shut it down any time he wants to. He might
9	suffer the consequences, but it doesn't mean
10	he can't shut it down.
11	MR. HENK:
12	Well, I disagree with everything you
13	said except for that he might suffer the
14	consequences. I agree with that.
15	MR. QUINN:
16	You don't agree that he can shut it
17	down? You don't agree that an expert can
18	shut it down?
19	MR. HENK:
20	Absolutely, I disagree.
21	MS. CASE:
22	Not legitimately.
23	MR. QUINN:
24	And so that you believe, as I'm
25	afraid many, many lawyers do, and I don't
309
1	know why they do, that you control this
2	deposition rather than him?
3	MR. HENK:
4	If you want to cite a rule to me --
5	MR. QUINN:
6	And that you can act any way you
7	want to act, and ask any question any way
8	that you want to ask it, and that this
9	gentleman has to sit here and he has to
Page 279
10	answer it. if that is what was intended by
11	the rules, then the rules are wrong. And I
12	don't believe that it was ever intended that
13	a deposition turns into an interrogation.
14	And once it does, I do believe that a person
15	who is being interrogated can shut it down.
16	MR. HENK:
17	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, are you stopping
18	this deposition because of a desire to hire
19	counsel with respect to your testimony?
20	A. I'm not sure. I'll have to think
21	about that. But I'm stopping it because
22	it's gone far afield, and all the reasons he
23	mentioned over the course of this day, and
24	I'll think about that particular issue.
25	MR. QUINN:
310
1	Are you willing to answer his
2	questions dealing with your testimony --
3	THE WITNESS:
4	And my opinions? Yes.
5	MR. QUINN:
6	And your opinions that you will give
7	in these two cases?
8	THE WITNESS:
9	And have done so extensively in this
10	deposition without hesitation, and with
11	precision and accuracy and all the things
12	I'm supposed to do.
13	MR. HENK:
14	well, I was just asking about his
15	testimony, as I understand that that's the
16	reason he's stopping the deposition.
17	MR. QUINN:
18	You and I are talking about
19	different things when we use the word
20	"testimony." I'm talking about --
21	THE WITNESS:
22	Well, I've got things to do. If
23	we're not going to go on any further --
24	MS. CASE:
25	Before we go off the record, I just
311
1	want to say that if we do come back to ask
2	the professor more questions with regard to
3	this situation, I would not anticipate that
4	it would be on my client's dime.
5	MR. QUINN:
6	And let me offer this possible
7	suggestion. Maybe we should do this in
8	front of the judge. Maybe we ought -- there
9	are times when it is -- when it is prudent.
10	Because I've got concerns. You've got
11	concerns, we don't agree on a whole lot.
12	Maybe we should ask the judge if he would
13	like to sit in on the rest of this
14	deposition and then he can determine what
15	you can and you can't ask and how he should
Page 281
16	answer. Would you be willing to do that?
17	MR. HENK:
18	I would a hundred percent willing to
19	do that. I think that's a fantastic idea.
20	MR. QUINN:
21	I think we need to explore that
22	because I think he needs to see the whole
23	context. You know, you read a deposition
24	and you don't get the context of the
25	deposition.
312
1	Now, luckily, we've got a video
2	here, and so we've gotten some of that. But
3	you don't get the whole context, and I --
4	you know, I think -- I think that that may
5	be the -- you need to talk to your people
6	and see if maybe that ought not to be the
7	way we proceed with the rest of this Proctor
8	issue.
9	MS. CASE:
10	I want to make clear that Reynolds
11	is not agreeing to shut down the deposition
12	by any means, but to the extent that the
13	professor is deciding to shut it down, we'd
14	be willing to discuss a remedy in how to
15	complete the deposition. But we are not
16	acquiescing to shutting it down at this
17	point.
18	MR. QUINN:
19	Professor, let's make it clear why
20	you are shutting it down.
21	EXAMINATION
22	BY MR. QUINN:
23	Q. Are you shutting it down because you
24	will not answer any more questions about
25	your opinions --
313
1	MS. CASE:
2	Objection, leading.
3	MR. QUINN:
4	Q. -- in the either Humpal case or the
5	Hibner case?
6	MS. CASE:
7	Object to the form.
8	A. No.
9	MR. QUINN:
10	Q. Are you willing to answer questions
11	regarding the opinions you intend to give in
12	each of those cases?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Have you, since 9:00 this morning,
15	been asked repeatedly about your prior
16	testimony in the Koballa deposition?
17	MS. CASE:
18	Object to the form.
19	A. Yes.
20	MR. QUINN:
21	Q. And are the questions that you are
Page 283
22	being asked now repetitive?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. And do you feel, at this point in
25	time, despite the fact that you don't think
314
1	that the individuals are intimidating, that,
2	in fact, the line of questioning is beyond
3	the scope of what you were asked for here
4	today and that, in fact, are intimidating?
5	MS. CASE:
6	Object to the form.
7	A. Yes.
8	MR. QUINN:
9	Q. And, you know, earlier, it seems to
10	me that the whole reason for this is that
11	there is some idea that there was some
12	sinister attempt to try and persuade some
13	defense experts either not to testify or not
14	to gather information on behalf of the
15	tobacco companies, was that ever something
16	that you even ever thought about or
17	discussed with anybody?
18	MS. CASE:
19	Object to the form.
20	A. No. I would never do that.
21	MR. QUINN:
22	Q. And the conduct that you've
23	witnessed here today from the defense
24	lawyers for the tobacco companies that are
Page 284
25	here, has that intimidated you?
1	A. The line of questioning, as I said
2	earlier, yes. I feel like I'm being set up.
3	Q. And is it -- do you believe it is
4	ironically an attempt to do the same thing
5	that they have accused Mr. Proctor of doing?
6	MS. CASE:
7	Object to the form.
8	MR. QUINN:
9	Q. And that is, not testifying for the
10	plaintiffs in tobacco litigation?
11	MR. HENK:
12	I'm objecting to this whole line of
13	whatever it is.
14	MR. QUINN:
15	Answer the question.
16	MS. CASE:
17	Are we shutting this down, really?
18	MR. HENK:
19	He ended the deposition and we're
20	now 1eavi ng.
21	MR. QUINN:
22	Answer the question and keep it on
23	the record. Answer the question.
24	A. Yes. I mean, they would rather I
25	did not participate in this or any other
316
1	trial. I'm sure that that opinion has been
2	made clear to me today.
3	MR. QUINN:
4	That1s al1.
5	MS. CASE:
6	Okay. So Dr. Kyriakoudes is
7	shutting down the deposition and we'll take
8	it up with the court.
9	MR. QUINN:
10	Unless you want to ask him questions
11	about his opinions, and then he's willing to
12	stay -- as he already told you, he's willing
13	to stay until 5:30. So if there are any
14	other questions about that, we are certainly
15	here to answer those.
16	MS. CASE:
17	Questions as to bias are always
18	relevant.
19	MR. HENK:
20	For purposes of the record, I was
21	stating my personal opinion that I think it
22	would be a good idea to conduct the rest of
23	this deposition in front of Judge Parsons.
24	But obviously, I'm one lawyer, and I will
25	have to confer with my client. I'll note
317
1	for the record that Mr. Quinn is laughing at
LKyriakoudes 10012009
2	my statement about that. I think that's
3	unfortunate. But I do think it is a good
4	idea.
5	MR. QUINN:
6	I'm laughing at your equivocation.
7	MR. HENK:
8	Well, it's not an equivocation, sir.
9	You may not appreciate this, but I can't
10	make decisions for my client.
11	MR. QUINN:
12	I know.
13	MR. HENK:
14	I can state what I personally
15	believe.
16	MS. CASE:
17	Off the record.
18	VIDEO REPORTER:
19	If there are no further questions,
20	this concludes Tape 6.
21	MS. CASE:
22	I'm sorry, Kathleen.
23	MS. KAPETANOVIC:
24	I think I'd just add, despite Mr.
25	Quinn's statements, Liggett's going to
318
1	reserve any questions for Dr. Kyriakoudes,
2	whether they pertain to bias or pertain to
3	factual matters in the Hibner and Humpal
4	case until this is resolved, we're not
LKyriakoudes 10012009
5	waiving our right to ask questions on that
6	basis.
7	VIDEO REPORTER:
8	I'm going off the record. The time
