25_
2	DR. JOAN HOFF, after having first been
3	duly sworn by a Notary Public of the State of New
4	York, was examined and testified as follows:
5	NOTARY PUBLIC: Please state
6	your name for the record.
7	THE WITNESS: Joan Hoff.
8	NOTARY PUBLIC: What is your
9	present home address?
10	THE WITNESS: It's a PO Box
11	address in Big Sky, Montana. It's
12	160806 in Big Sky, Montana 59716.
13	VIDEO-CONFERENCED EXAMINATION BY
14	MR. PAIGE:
15	Q. Good morning, Dr. Hoff.
16	A. Good morning.
17	Q. Do you live in New York?
18	A. I live part-time in New York
19	about five months out of the year. I am a 2 0	resident of Montana.
21	Q. I’m going to take your
2 2	deposition on this case. I need to know
23	certain things before we get into your
2	4	opinions.
25	Tell me in terms of what you
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	have reviewed in this case. I see you
3	relied on some materials. What else have
4	you looked at?
5	A. What I reviewed were the
6	depositions for the case and then the
7	material that you can see in the newspapers
8	in the geographical areas in which Ellen
9	Tate lived, and the educational materials
10	for the State of New York primarily.
11	Q. Did you review any other
12	depositions other than the ones in this
13	case in preparation for your testimony
14	today?
15	A. No.
16	Q. I have taken depositions of
17	other witnesses for the tobacco companies
18	where they may give them other depositions
19	that I've taken. You haven't reviewed 2 0	those?
21	A. No, I have not.
22	Q. How long have you been doing 2 3	this type of work for the tobacco
2	4	companies?
25 A. I have been doing work for
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	defense counsel Shook Hardy & Bacon since
3	1994.	.
4	Q. Are you — I don't want to say
5	ignorant — are you unaware of who Shook
6	Hardy & Bacon represents?
7	A. No, of course not.
8	Q. Because I asked you how long
9	you have been working with the tobacco
10	companies.
11	You understand that is a client
12	who you are performing work for, don't you?
13	A. Exactly. But my work is for
14	attorneys at Shook Hardy & Bacon.
15	Q. But you're working on tobacco
16	cases where the defendant is the tobacco
17	companies, you are not oblivious to that
18	fact, are you?
19	A. No, I am not oblivious to that 2 0	fact.
21	Q. Have you met anybody from the
2 2	actual tobacco companies?
23	A. No.
24	Q. Never in the 15 years, you
2	5	never met anybody, even at trial?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. No, I have not.
3	Q. How is it that you got
4	involved with testifying for the tobacco
5	companies?
6	A. I was contacted in 1994 to see
7	if I would be interested in doing research
8	on the history of tobacco use, and I was at
9	Indiana University at the time and I had a
10	number of graduate students who were
11	finishing their PHDs who were available to
12	help me with this kind of research,
13	Q. Asa historian, I take it you
14	do a lot of reading?
15	A. A lot Yes.
16	Q. That's what historians do,
17	they read a lot.
18	A. Yes, unfortunately.
19	Q. Or fortunately. At least you
2 0	don't have time to watch as much TV as I
21	do, so you are better off.
22	In 1994 when you were hired by
23	the tobacco companies, it wasn't as much 2 4	published on their conduct as it is now, is
2	5	that a fair statement?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. You mean published in what
3	form?
4	Q. Well, in eveiy form.
5	A. By 1994 there were secondary
6	sources on the tobacco industry and tobacco
7	use, yes.
8	Q. After 1994 when their
9	documents became public they were published
10	all over the internet, there were books
11	written, movies made about their conduct in
12	terms of lying to the public. You're aware
13	of that, are you not?
14	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
15	form of the question. You can answer.
16	A. As of 1994 — after 1994 there
17	was exactly what you said, the information
18	about documents, there were some books
19	written.
20	Not all of the information that
21	came out after 1994 indicated, as you said
22	at the end of your statement, that they were
23	lying, because not all of the books
2	4	addressed that question.
25 Q. Right. But, well, you
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	understand in this case it's been found as
3	a matter of law that the client who hired
4	you from Shook Hardy & Bacon has been found
5	to have lied about the addictive nature and
6	the deadly effects of cigarettes; you know
7	that, don't you?
8	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
9	form of the question.
10	A. I am not aware of that, unless
11	you are referring to a specific case or a
12	decision in a case, that the terms you are
13	using, that they lied, were actually used.
14	Q. Well, what terms would you
15	use? Tell me what terms you feel
16	comfortable with.
17	We can go on and on about this.
18	You know what I'm talking about. What terms
19	are you comfortable with?
20	A. I don't know, because I'm not
21	sure what case you are referring to or what 2 2	decision you are referring to.
2 3	I'm not an expert on decisions
2	4	in cases following 1994.
25 Q. Ma'am, I am not asking if you
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	are an expert. 1 am asking if you have
3	read or heard about Florida law, the cases
4	that you are working on.
5	Have you looked at any of the
6	lawsuits, the complaints that were filed?
7	A. All I've looked at was —
8	Q. Have you looked at the
9	complaints?
10	A. No, I have not.
11	Q. Have you heard about the
12	annual decision in your readings as a
13	historian? Have you heard about it?
14	A. Yes, I have.
15	Q. So you're not oblivious to the
16	fact that in Florida for these Engle cases
17	there's a finding as a matter of law that
18	Phillip Morris and other tobacco companies
19	along with the Tobacco Institute Research 2 0	Counsel conspired to conceal the addictive 21	nature and the adverse health effects of
2 2	cigarettes with the intent that the public
2 3	would rely upon it? Are you aware of that?
2 4 MR. DAVIS: I object to the
2	5 form.	______
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. All I know about the Engle
3	case was that it was a major class action
4	suit which was thrown out by the Supreme
5	Court of Florida resulting in these
6	individual cases.
7	Q. How do you know that?
8	A. That was available in one of
9	the newspaper articles I read back in --. 0	must have been 2000, 2004, 2006.
. 1 Q. But you have never read any of
. 2	the articles that said what they were found
. 3	to have done?
A A. No. It wasn't part of my
. 5	research.
.6 Q. I'm not asking about your
. 7	research. I am asking as a human being
. 8	have you come across any of the articles
. 9	that said what the tobacco companies were
10	found to have done in Florida?
! 1 A. Not that I know of. I simply
12	noted the fact that there was this large
! 3	class action suit which was thrown out.
. 4	That was the only information that I
! 5	thought was relevant.
ll
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Why was it relevant that it
3	was thrown out? First of all, it wasn't
4	thrown out, but why do you think that was
5	relevant?
6	A. Because it resulted then in
7	these numerous individual cases.
8	Q. Well, as a result of what you
9	say, it was thrown out, there are findings
10	of law that Phillip Morris conspired to
L1	conceal the addictive nature and the
12	adverse health effects of smoking. You did
13	not know that, I assume.
14	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
15	form.
16	A. Not to any detailed degree as
17	you are saying here. No, not in that
18	language.
L 9 Q. Well, in what language or
10	detail were you aware of it?	-
21	A. I wasn't. I just knew that
22	the suit had been thrown out and that you
13	had individual cases resulting.
14	Q. And the article you are 1 25	talking about is within your reliance _:
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	materials?
3	A. No, it's not.
4	Q. Where was that article that
5	you are talking about? Was tiiat in the New
6	York Times?
7	A. Probably in the New York
8	Times.
9	Q. The article you are talking
10	about didn't say anything about what I'm
11	talking about?
12	A. It may have said it. I just
13	read the headline and the first couple of
14	paragraphs.
15	Q. Now, have you read any books
16	that talk about what I’m talking about; the
17	conspiracy or the concealing of information
18	from the public?
19	A. I've read a couple of books,
20	or at least read reviews of a couple of
21	books that have been published since 1994.
22	Q. Well, first tell me the books 2 3	you have read, and then tell me what
2	4	reviews you've read.
25 A. Well, most of this comes from
13
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	die New York Review of Books, and it
3	concerned the Richard Kluger book.
4	Q. Ma'am, please tell me the
5	books you have read first, then I am going
6	to ask you what reviews you read.
7	A. As I said, most of what I read
8	occurred in reviews in the New York Review
9	of Books, including the Richard Kluger L 0	book.
L1 Q. Ma'am, I don't want to know
12	about the most. I want you to first tell
L 3	me about the books you have read, then we
L 4	will talk about the most reviews. What
L 5	books have you read?
L 6 A. I have only looked at, I have
L7	not completely read the Richard Kluger
L 8	book, Ashes to Ashes.
L 9	I have read reviews of the
10	Phillip Hilts book, and I have seen reviews
11	of the Allan Brandt book. I have seen
12	reviews of the Stanton Glantz books.
13	Most of these -- this
14	information — came from the New York Review 25	of Books.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	I do have a copy of the Kluger
3	book, but I did not read it in its entirety.
4	Q. You are talking about authors.
5	I want to know about the titles.
6	The Kluger book is Ashes to
7	Ashes?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. Was that given to you as a
10	present? Did you buy it on your own?
11	A. 1 bought it on my own.
12	Q. Where is that book, at your
13	home?
14	A. It's in Montana, yes.
15	Q. Actually, the book is about —
16	is that book about Phillip Morris or about
17	Brandon Williamson?
18	A. About both actually.
19	Q. You are doing work for Phillip 2 0	Morris as a historian for 15 years, you
21	have this book, you do a lot of reading.
2 2	Why couldn't you complete that
2	3	book? Were the facts too troubling to you
24	or was there any reason?
25	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
15
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	form of the question.
3	A. It's simply that in terms of
4	the research —
5	Q. Ma'am, I don't know why you
6	are laughing.
7	You know, 450,000 — you are
8	laughing again. I find this troubling. You
9	are laughing when 450,000 Americans die
10	every year, and they have already been found
11	in many courts, including this court you are
12	testifying to, to have lied to the public
13	with the intent that people would rely upon
14	their lies and ultimately die, and that is
15	what that book is about.
16	Before you tell me what parts
17	you read, tell me why you think that is
18	funny.
19	MR. DAVIS: I move to strike.
2 0 Have you finished the question?
21	MR. PAIGE: Yes. I want to
22	know why it's funny.
2 3	MR. DAVIS: I move to strike
2	4 the statement of counsel. I move to 25 strike the comments.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	You can certainly answer. I
3	object to the form of the question.
4	A. I am not laughing about any of
5	the figures you have just sited.
6	What I may be smiling about is
7	the type of research I do is not based on
8	reading secondary sources which appeared
9	after 1994, and so consequently there would
10	be no reason for me to have read every
11	single page of the Kluger book or any of the
12	others that I mentioned.
13	I did, as I said, read reviews
14	that came out on these books, mainly in the
15	New York Review of Books, and that's my
16	reason for my smiling, was that the question
17	is irrelevant to the kind of research I do.
18	Q. Ma’am, most respectfully, you
19	are not the judge, so I think somebody else 2 0	will determine whether it is relevant or
21	not. What you think is irrelevant I may
2 2	disagree with you.
2 3	The judge may also disagree
24	with you. You know Judge Streitfeld. We
2	5	will let him decide what is relevant and not
17
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	relevant, okay?
3	A. Fine.
4	Q. Tell me how much of the book
5	you read.
6	A. I would say perhaps maybe 5 or
7	10 percent at most.
8	Q. Do you know what portions you
9	read?
10	A. No. I scanned it. I tend
11	to --1 read a lot, as you indicated at the
12	beginning, and I tend to scan a lot when I
13	read.
14	Q. When you read a book,
15	typically you will scan and read 5 or
16	10 percent of books?
17	A. Very often, yes.
18	Q. So you read this book in the
19	same fashion as you read most books?
20	A. Most history books, yes.
21	Q. The other books, can you tell 2 2	me the titles you read reviews on?
23	A. Not sure I have all the
2	4	titles. I know Stanton Glantz wrote a book
25	on tobacco wars, which I think was on _
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	propositions in California, and then he
3	wrote another book -- or edited really a
4	book — on these private documents that
5	came out after 1994.
6	Q. So that was Cigarette Papers?
7	A. Yes, it was.
8	Q. Do you have Cigarette Papers
9	in your home?
10	A. No.
11	Q. What reviews did you read on
12	Cigarette Papers?
13	A. That was in the New York
14	Review of Books.
15	Q, But I don't know what that is.
16	Is it one review or several reviews? What
17	is that?
18	A. It's a national magazine which
19	tends to do both reviews in literature and
20	histoiy, in social science, of all kinds of
21	disciplines.
22	It is a multi-disciplinary
23	review magazine, and in the case of these
24	books on tobacco, they tended to review diem
25	in groups. That's why it was very easy for
19
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	me then to get summaries about the
3	information in these books.
4	Q. How can I get that?
5	A. You can just go onto the
6	website for New York Review of Books and it
7	will — the back reviews will pop up.
8	Q. You put in the title of the
9	book?
10	A. You can put in the title of
11	the book or the subject matter, but I read
12	them -- I subscribe to it, so I read it as
13	hard copy.
14	Q. So you did it in the subject
15	matter or by title of the book?
16	A. I did it as it came to me for
17	the most part, the collection of — the
18	first collection that included the Kluger
19	book was simply, I think, under the heading
20	of books on tobacco or some such.
21	Q. Then what about the other 2 2	ones?
23	A. Well, the Phillip Hilts book I
2 4	think was called Smoke Stream, and I don't
2	5	know the name of the Allan Brandt book, but
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	those are the ones that I am aware of as
3	having been published since 1994.
4	Q. Allan Brandt was Cigarette
5	Century, I believe.
6	A. Could be. Yes, it was
7	Cigarette Century.
8	Q. You read the reviews on that?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. You don't have that book?
11	A. No.
12	Q, Then in terms of your work as
13	a historian who does a lot of reading, do
14	you generally rely upon reviews or will you
15	generally scan the book as you described
16	Ashes to Ashes or do you do both?
17	A. I tend to do both. Keep in
18	mind, I do a lot of contemporary history,
19	foreign policy, politics, economic studies,
2 0	and so it would be unusual for me to read
21	all of the books in those fields because
2 2	there are so many of them, so I tend either
23	to read these reviews, and then if I'm
2 4	particularly interested in a foreign policy
2	5	study I will either get the book out of the
21
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	library or buy it and read it more
3	carefully, but there is no way as a
4	contemporary historian I can read
5	everything page by page.
6	Q. How long are these reviews
7	that you're reading on the cigarette books?
8	A. In the New York Review of
9	Books, they are known for extremely long
10	reviews.
11	They go on for sometimes eight,
12	nine, ten pages. It is a folio-size
13	publication. It's this long and this wide.
14	It's very big and the articles are very
15	long.
16	Q. Do you read all the reviews
17	that come to you in the hard copy that you
18	get or do you select which ones interest
19	you? '
20	A. I select the ones I am
11	interested in.
22	Q. Why is it that you read the
23	Cigarette Century, Cigarette Papers and
24	Ashes to Ashes review?
25	A. Because of the research I had
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	previously done on tobacco.
3	Q. Are you constantly
4	supplementing your research, I assume?
5	A. In what sense?
6	Q. You did research in 1994 on
7	this topic. You didn’t stop in 1994, did
8	you?
9	A. No.
10	Q. As more research comes out you
11	do more reading, right?
12	A. Well, as the time period in
13	which I'm primarily doing the research,
14	which usually is from — when 1 first
15	started it I went back to the 15 th century,
16	but increasingly what I do is research in
17	the 20di century, from say the early 1900s
18	through maybe 1990, so in that sense I have
19	a limited time period of the 20th century.
20	Q. But can you answer my
21	question?
22	A. Well, if the research I've
23	done from 1900, let’s say, to 1990,1 think
2	4	is fairly complete at this point in terms 25	of national publications like magazines,
23
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	newspapers, educational materials, looking
3	at popular culture, looking at materials
4	that would have appeared in all movies or
5	on television up to 1990,1 think for the
6	last 15 or 16 years I have done a fairly
7	thorough comprehensive job.
8	Q. So what is the answer to my
9	question?
10	A. The answer is -- I guess to
11	your question is -- if I continue to add
12	material after 1994, the basic research I
13	have done for the 20th century, the answer
14	is no.
15	Q. But I didn't ask you about the
16	basic information. I asked you did you
17	continue doing research as an expert since
18	1994.	"
19	A. Of course I have.
20	Q. That's an easy answer, right?
21	You don't have to ramble on like that,
2 2	ma’am.
23	MR. DAVIS: I move to strike.
2	4 That is not a question.
25 Q. Ma’am, most respectfully, if
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	you can just answer my questions — and
3	again you are smirking, I don’t appreciate
4	it. I don’t want to call the judge. I
5	want to get out of here as quick as
6	possible, and I want you to answer my
7	questions.
8	If I ask you a question did you
9	continue to research since 1994, you
10	answered it after me asking you four times.
11	I don’t want to waste my time.
12	I don’t really care if you want to waste
13	your time, I am not wasting my time today.
14	It is Friday. I am not going to be here all
15	day with you.
16	Can you please just answer my
17	questions?
18	A. Yes. It might have been my
19	mistake.
20	Q. If you don't understand my
21	question, tell me you don't understand it.
22	A. Okay.
23	Q. Fair enough?
24	A. Right ^
25	Q. How much money have you made
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	since 1994? I’m sure you have been asked
3	that before. Do you know?
4	A. Yes. '
5	Q. How much?
6	A. Around 225,000 in the last 16
7	years, which amounts to about 13, 14,000 a
8	year.
9	Q. That's not very much.
10	A. Not over that time period, I
11	agree.
12	Q. You need to talk to him,
13	because most of the other experts for the
14	tobacco companies are making a lot more.
15	Do you know that?
16	A. Not really. I have heard
17	rumors about it. I don't really know.
18	Q. The last couple of cases you
19	testified on — I think I saw you testified
20	in — what was it — with Steve Hammer in
21	front of Streitfeld. What was the name of 2 2	that case, do you know?
2 3 A. There have been two.
2 4	Barbinell and Putney.
2	5 Q. What was your total bill on_
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Barbinell? Do you know, more or less?
3	A. I think that it ended up —
4	the total ended up around 20,000 on
5	Barbinell alone.
6	Q. What about Putney?
7	A. It was 13.
8	Q. So there must have been a
9	period of time where you didn't do any work
10	then?
11	A. Yes. Well, there was a period L 2	of time when I simply didn't testify.
1.3 Q. So just tell me pretty much
L 4	what's been going on generally in the last
L 5	16 years you have been in tobacco. You
L 6	make 40 grand in a couple months and you
L7	have made 225 over 15 years. Why is that?
18	A. I only testified in four
19	cases, and from beginning in 1996 ending in
10	2001 1 did no more testimony at all until
11	last year.
12	Q. How many cases are you
13	presently retained on?
14	A. That I'm listed in right now?
25	MR. DAVIS: Retained. If you
27
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	know.
3	A. I am retained here in the Tate
4	case.
5	Q. Do you know how many other
6	cases you have been listed as an expert on?
7	A. I think as many as 11 or 12.
8	I'm not sure how many I'm listed in.
9	Q. Have you begun doing research
10	in those 11 or 12 cases?
11	A. No.
12	Q. Do you plan on it at some
13	point?
14	A. Depending on my own time
15	constraints, I think I can accommodate a
16	few of those cases, yes.
17	Q. How much have you been paid on
18	this case so far?
19	A. I have submitted invoices in 2 0	this case for $3,000.
21	Q. That was for reading the
2 2	deposition, I assume?
23	A. Primarily, yes. About 12
2	4	hours of work.
25	Q. You rec ently added McC all's
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Magazine. Why is that?
3	A. I found in one of the
4	depositions that I only read last week, I
5	think it was in Ellen Tate's first
6	husband's deposition, that he thought she
7	did read McCall's while they were married.
8	I simply didn't know that.
9	Q. Did you look in the time
10	period that they were married?
11	A. Yes. I had previously looked
12	at Readers Digest which is a reference work
13	which lists all magazines published in the
14	United States, and I had previously looked
15	at women's magazines, titles of women's
16	magazines to see what articles they had
17	published on tobacco or smoking, so I had a
18	list of articles from McCall's already from
19	previous research.
20	So when I saw the statement in
21	that deposition about McCall's, then I went 2 2	back to that to see what I did.
23	Q. When you went to McCall's, did
2 4	you print out — you know, there's
2	5	pro-tobacco and anti-tobacco articles --
29
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	strike that.
3	In your research you have seen
4	pro-smoking and anti-smoking articles,
5	correct?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q- I know you looked at the New
8	York Times, right?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. You have seen articles from
11	the 50s and 60s saying hey, smoking is bad,
12	it causes lung cancer, right?
13	A. Yes.	^
14	Q. You have seen articles from
15	the 50s and 60s saying it hasn't been
16	proven that smoke causes lung cancer,
17	right?
18	A. Usually in the same articles
19	that said that it did cause lung cancer,
2 0	yes.
21	Q. Ma'am, I'm sure you have seen
22	other articles where it's not only within
23	the articles but stand-alone articles
2	4	saying it has not been proven that smoking
25	causes lung cancer during that timeframe in
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	the New York Times, are you aware of that?
3	A. Yes, but the stand-alone
4	articles —
5	Q. Am I asking you about the
6	quantity? Am I asking you how many
7	articles?
8	A. No, you're not, but you are
9	implying that there is some land of balance
10	between the articles.
11	Q. Ma'am, I am not implying
12	anything. I am trying to ask you a
13	question so I can ask you another question.
14	A. Alright.
15	Q. I am not implying anything.
16	You don't have to try to guess at what I’m
17	asking. It is not necessary. You are
18	smirking again.
19	MR. DAVIS: She is not
2 0 smirking. Maybe it’s the camera.
21	MR. PAIGE: She is. I wish I
2 2 had a videotape because that would not
23	be true, Steve.
2 4 Q. Ma'am, you are under oath.
2	5	Were you just smiling or smirking?
31
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I don't think I am smiling or
3	smirking, but I am I think responding —
4	Q. Now I know what I'm dealing
5	with, because you won't even admit that
6	you're smiling or smirking when I am
7	looking at you and I see that you are.
8	MR. DAVIS: That’s not a
9	question.
10	MR. PAIGE: I will depose the
11	court reporter next to see if you are
12	telling the truth. Why don’t we do
13	that. That's what I’m going to do.
14	MR. DAVIS: Please proceed
15	with your deposition.
16	Q. I want you to tell the truth,
17	ma'am. If I can’t get a simple answer on
18	whether you are smiling, that's a problem.
19	MR. DAVIS: I move to strike
20	the comments of counsel.
21	Q. My question to you — I don't
2 2	even remember where I was going although
2 3	now 1 think I do -- when you read the New
2 4	York Times and you see articles saying it
2	5	had not been proven that cigarettes cause
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	lung cancer in the 50s and 60s, are you
3	aware of that?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. When you reviewed the New York
6	Times in the 50s and 60s did you see
7	articles that described other things such
8	as air pollution as the cause of the rise
9	in lung cancer in the 50s and 60s?
10	A. There were some articles, yes.
11	Q. When you reviewed McCall's,
12	did you see similar types of articles
13	saying it had not been proven or there were
14	other causes of the rise in lung cancer?
15	A. Not so much in McCall's. Some
16	of the other women's magazines, but not
17	McCall's.
18	Q. Which women's magazines?
19	A. The best women's magazines for
20	information on tobacco and smoking was Good
21	Housekeeping and Ladies Home Journal.
22	Q. Did they have those type of 2 3	articles that I just described?
24	A. They had a few. It wasn't the
2	5	major concern of the women's magazines.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	They were usually trying to convey to women
3	how they could stop smoking or the health
4	hazards of smoking.
5	Q. It was Good Housekeeping and
6	Ladies Home Journal?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Did you include on your
9	reliance materials die articles from those
10	two publications that represented it had
11	not been proven or there were other causes
12	of lung cancer?
13	A. I included in the reliance
14	materials, I think, almost all of the
15	articles from those women’s magazines.
16	Q. It's easier for me when you
17	just answer my question. That's all I
18	wanted to know. I thank you for that.
19	Did you receive a copy of our 2 0	subpoena for your deposition?
21	A. Yes, I did.
22	MR. DAVIS: Can you hear us?
23	You were a little muffled there. We
24	heard the question.
2	5 Q. When did you receive the duces
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	tecum?
3	A. I received these, I think with
4	the depositions, either last week or the
5	week before.
6	Q. And tell me what you brought
7	in response to it.
8	A. What I did after reading
9	through what it was that I was to bring
L 0	widi me, I brought the two invoices and I
L1	brought my notes from the depositions and I
L 2	brought my notes from the Fort Lauderdale
L3	Sun Sentinel.
L 4 Q. I'm sorry, can you repeat
L 5	that?
L 6 A. Yes. I brought the two
L7	invoices for the case, I brought the notes
L 8	from the depositions which I read last
L 9	week, and then I brought my notes from the
10	Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel, but those
11	notes came from previous research, but
12	since she apparently read the Sun Sentinel,
23	I thought they were relevant to the case.
IA Q. We will mark all your notes as
15	composite Exhibit 1.
35
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Can I tell which are from which
3	or no? Can you tell which are from the Sun
4	Sentinel if I look at them or should I mark
5	them separately?
6	I will mark the notes and Sun
7	Sentinel as Exhibit 1 and the notes to the
8	depositions as Exhibit 2.
9	MR. DAVIS: Hold on.
10	THE WITNESS: This is the Sun
11	Sentinel.
12	MR. DAVIS: This will be
13	Exhibit 1.
14	You have identified Exhibit 1.
15	What do you want as Exhibit 2, Gary?
16	MR. PAIGE: The notes to the
17	depo.
18	MR. DAVIS: Okay.
19	Q. What other notes do you have,
2	0	ma'am?
21	A. Just the invoices.
22	MR. PAIGE: I will mark that
23	as Exhibit 3.
24	Q. Then did you bring your
25	reliance discs with von?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. No.
3	MR. DAVIS: We have them here.
4	Q. Did you bring anything else or
5	that was it?
6	A. That was it.
7	Q. Did you bring —
8	MR. DAVIS: TheCV?
9	A. The CV is here.
10	MR. PAIGE: I will mark that
11	as Exhibit 4, just to make sure I have
12	your up-to-date CV.
13	Q. What about e-mails or letters?
14	A. None in this case. There's
15	been one e-mail as of last night which
16	indicated that a deposition would start a
17	half hour late.
18	Q. Did you ever have any -- a lot
19	of the experts routinely delete e-mails.
2 0	Have you had any e-mails or
21	notes on your computers that you have
2	2	deleted over time in the regular course of
23	your business?
24	A. For this case or for —
25	O. In eeneral for vour work in
37
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	tobacco.
3	A. I’ve had some e-mails over
4	time. I think they were submitted. About
5	a half a dozen e-mails were submitted in
6	the Barbinell case. That is the only time
7	I think there are any kind of e-mails that
8	were substantive.
9	Q. What were those about?
10	A. Usually about reliance
11	materials and perhaps discussions of the
12	information I obtained from depositions.
13	Q. Is there a reason why you
14	didn't bring those with you today?
15	A. Because I have none in this
16	case.
17	Q. I think we asked for any Engle
18	case.
19	MR. DAVIS: We have objected
20	to anything beyond the Tate case. You
21	have our objection on that.
22	MR. PAIGE: Can you get that?
2 3 Can you give them to me or are you
2	4 going to really object to that?
25	MR DAVIS- Twill sppifT
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	can locate them, Gaiy, I will produce
3	them to you.
4	MR. PAIGE: Thank you.
5	Q. Then what about other e-mails
6	over the years; have you had other e-mails
7	over the years that you may have deleted
8	when you were first reviewing stuff with
9	the tobacco lawyers?
10	A. Back when I started this in
11	1994 there were phone calls primarily.
12	Q. Didn't really have cell phones
13	back then.
14	A. Right. It was a primitive
15	time period.
16	Q. Have you ever spoken to any
17	other tobacco historians, like Ford or
18	Schaller?
19	A. No, I haven't. I know
2 0	Schaller personally, I know his work on the
21	Far East, but I haven't spoken to him about
2 2	this.
23	Q. Is that what he's known for,
2 4	his work on the Far East?
2	5 A. Yes. He is a major Far
39
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Eastern scholar.
3	Q. I didn't know that. Okay.
4	Of all die tobacco historians I
5	actually really liked Schaller. He was a
6	very nice guy.
7	A. Yes. He's very personable.
8	He is well-liked by his students. He is a
9	good teacher.
10	Q. So it wasn't just an act with
11	me?
12	A. It was not.
13	Q. Did you write a report or
14	generate a report in this case?
15	A. For --
16	MR. DAVIS: Tate.
17	Q. For the lawyers.
18	A. No, I didn't.
19	Q. Sometimes people write 2 0	reports.
21	A. No, I didn’t.
22	Q. Have you published — tell me
2 3	about your — you said Schaller was known
2 4	for his work in the Far East. What do you
2	5	know him for?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I know him primarily — as I
3	said earlier, I study contemporary history,
4	so what I've done is largely US foreign
5	policy, politics, US presidents and US
6	women and their legal status, usually for
7	the 20th century, which makes me a
8	contemporary historian.
9	Q. Do you know historians or —
10	do you know Allan Brandt, by the way?
11	A. No, I don't.
12	Q. Do you know of his work?
13	A. Actually, I am not personally
14	familiar with it. I know his name, but I
15	didn't bother to look up to see what he's
16	written.
17	Q. There are some historians who
18	specialize in -- who are published and
19	well-known on history of tobacco, correct?
20	A. There are some, yes.
21	Q. Do you know their names?
22	A. No, I don’t.
2 3 Q. You don't know any of their
2	4	names?
25 A. I would say the only one that
41
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	comes to mind — but it’s because I know of
3	his earlier work — would be Kirkutis, but
4	his earlier work was on southern economic
5	plantations, but he is a historian.
6	I hesitate because I'm not sure
7	that some of the other people who have
8	written tobacco histories or smoking
9	histories are trained as historians. That
10	is the only reason why I am hesitating.
11	Q. Tell me the main type of books
12	you have published.
13	A. On presidents, on US foreign
14	policy, on women and legal status, I have
15	done interesting but kind of odd work on
16	Irish peasants, and so I've done — unlike
17	a lot of historians, I don't concentrate on
18	one field or one area, so my work has
19	varied over the years.
20	Q. Have you published anything
21	lately?	'	'
22	A. Yes. Last year I published a 2 3	book on US foreign policy that was
2 4	nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. It didn't
2	5	win._
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Can't always win.
3	A. Can't always win.
4	Q. Have you published anything
5	before 1994 on cigarettes or tobacco or
6	things relevant in this case?
7	A. No, I have not.
8	Q. How about since 1994?
9	A. No, I haven't.
10	Q. When the cigarette companies
11	came to you in 1994 and said they wanted
12	you to be an expert, did you tell them you
13	hadn't published in that area at all?
14	A. I indicated to them that I was
15	interested in looking at the early, early
16	history and that my graduate students were
17	too. That’s about the extent of what I
18	said.
19	Q. But you did not share with
20	them that you had not been published in
21	that area at all?
22	A. I probably did indicate I
2 3	would have to go back and learn about the
2	4	field, yes.
25 Q. After being hired by them, did
43
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	you do any type of publications or submit
3	any work to any journals on the history of
4	tobacco or cigarettes?
5	A. No, I did not.
6	Q. What is the main course or the
7	areas that you teach?
8	A. Right now all I teach are
9	graduate students, but back in 1994 and of
10	course prior to '94 I taught survey courses
11	in American History, which is a normal
12	thing for someone like me to do, then I
13	taught specialized courses on those fields
14	in which I had been publishing; women's
15	history, women’s legal status, presidents,
16	modem presidents and US foreign policy and
17	politics.
18	Q. Did you ever teach any courses
19	related to tobacco or cigarettes?
20	A. Not separate courses, but in
21	all of the US survey courses when you teach
22	the colonial period you have to teach about 2 3	the economic importance of the growth of
2 4	tobacco and the exportation of tobacco from
2	5	the south.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. In the colonial times?
3	A. Yes, in that period and after
4	the revolution as well.
5	Q. Within your courses — that
6	was before and after 1994 that you did
7	include within your course some lectures on
8	the impact of tobacco during the colonial
9	and revolutionary times?
10	A. Yes, the economic impact. You
11	have to do that.
12	Q. What about the issues relevant
13	to these cases about the knowledge of the
14	health hazards and addictive nature of
15	cigarettes? Did you teach any courses on
16	that?
17	A. Again, for the survey classes,
18	they are divided usually. They stop with
19	the Civil War then continue after the Civil
20	War, but you do do both before and after
21	the Civil War period for those classes, you
22	do do reform groups, and in this instance
23	of course, the abolitionists took up
2 4	smoking and anti-tobacco component of their
2	5	activities, and so consequently that would
45
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	come into both the survey classes, the
3	activities of these abolitionists who then
4	take up anti-alcohol, anti-smoking
5	activities as well.
6	Q. What year was that?
7	A. Well, the abolitionists really
8	get going in the 50s, but the women who
9	were involved in the abolitionist movement
10	take up the issues of alcohol before the
11	Civil War and then they take up the issue
12	of smoking after the Civil War.
13	For example, Women's Christian
14	Temperance Union started out basically as an
15	abolitionist group, then because of its
16	title Temperance took up alcohol and smoking
17	after the Civil War.
18	Q. Why were they opposed to
19	smoking after the Civil War?
20	A. They begin to — because of
21	the literature that was available really 2 2	from the 17th and 18th centuries on
2 3	tobacco, they were able — one, they were a
2 4	religious-oriented group, they took up
2	5	smoking for moral reasons or took up
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	activity against it for moral reasons, then
3	after the Civil War, they increasingly in
4	their literature put out information about
5	the health hazards of smoking, so diey did
6	it for two reasons.
7	Q, What health hazards were they
8	concerned with in the 1 SOOs?
9	A. Veiy generally they were
10	concerned with the impact, in particular
11	diat it seemed to have on boys the standard
12	kind of reference in the late 19th century
13	was to the fact that it affected growth in
14	terms of — usually they were referring to
15	boys, but they also referred to breadiing
16	problems, they referred very generally to
17	circulatoiy problems.
18	This kind of information had
19	been available in earlier literature before
2 0	the Civil War, and they simply picked up on
21	it.
22	Q. There's ads, I'm sure you have
2 3	seen diem, where the athletes in the 40s
2 4	and 50s saying smoking doesn't get your
2	5	win. Are you familiar with that?
47
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Yes, and that goes back aways.
3	Q. There is also obviously — I
4	even heard it as a kid — if you smoke it
5	will stunt your growth?
6	A. Yeah, and that goes back into
7	the 19th century.
8	Q. But the actual lung cancer
9	scare, we are going to talk about it later,
10	that really didn't hit, I think you said
11	until die 50 s?
12	A. You have studies in the very
13	late 30s then 40s, but basically the cancer
14	scare problem is a problem in the 50s.
15	Q. So in your courses do you talk
16	about that?
17	A. The survey courses?
18	Q. You were telling me how you do
19	include this in your courses about how
2 0	people were opposed to smoking and it was
21	the women who were opposed to it because of
22	the tilings you talked about, dien obviously 2 3	in the 50s the debate heats up. Did you
2	4	cover that in your courses?
25 A. I haven't taught the survey_
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	course since the late 1990s.
3	When I taught these women's
4	reform groups, it was largely in women's
5	history classes, and so I did very
6	definitely talk about that for the
7	19th century and early 20th century, but
8	once I get into women’s history classes for,
9	let’s say, after the second World War, I am
10	primarily concerned with their legal rights
11	and change in their legal status.
12	So in the second half of those
13	women's history classes I wouldn't have
14	mentioned reform activity on behalf or
15	anti-smoking activities that were undertaken
16	by women.
17	Q. I saw articles in the New York
18	Times in the early 1900s where it says
19	encourage women to smoke, it's better than 2 0	drinking tea. Do you recall that?
21	A. I don't recall that specific
2 2	one.
23	Q. But do you recall that there
2	4	were people recommending that women smoke
25	in the early 1900s?
49
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. No, I don't.
3	Q. Do you recall that there were
4	articles in the early 1900s encouraging
5	boys to smoke, that it may help combat
6	meningitis or other disease?
7	A. I don't recall it for that in
8	the early 1900s. I know that back in the
9	1840s and 50s that smoking was sometimes
10	recommended in this country, but primarily
11	in Europe because they thought it warded
12	off epidemics and plagues of one kind or
13	another, and in fact several movies have
14	been made about that aspect of the idea
15	that they thought smoking could prevent you
16	from catching diseases which were spreading
17	through society.
18	Q. They thought tobacco would
19	work as a disinfectant and kill germs?
20	A. Yes. The articles I read and
21	in fact die movies I have seen were the
22	1840s and 50s.
2 3 Q. Did you see it in the
2	4	United States in the early 1900s as well?
25 A. I didn’t see reference to it_
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	in the United States. That's why I'm
3	trying to clarify what I remember.
4	Q. But there were periods of time
5	that you know of in history where smoking
6	was recommended to women and young boys?
7	A. I don’t know that, no, as a
8	specific recommendation for the early
9	1900s.	'
L0 Q. No, I didn't say early 1900s.
L1	I said there was a period of time — you
L2	said 1800s. I can show you things from the
L 3	1900s, but you would agree there was a
L 4	period of time where smoking was
L 5	recommended by some for women and young
L 6	boys?
L 7 A. If you have that information I
L 8	guess I could say I would agree if I saw
L 9	it, but I don't personally know of that,
10	those kinds of recommendations.
11	Q. What recommendations are you
12	talking about from the 1840s?
13	A. There was in the literature,
14	and some of the literature was put out, for
15	example if you go back to Benjamin Rush and
51
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	a few medical people who were coming out of
3	the American Revolution, and even in some
4	of the sermons by preachers both before and
5	after the Revolution, they sometimes would
6	mention that perhaps smoking could ward off
7	certain diseases, and 1 do know that from
8	reading secondary sources that this was
9	a -- if not common at least a perception of
10	smoking, that it had some medicinal affect,
11	but in this country by the time of the Pure
12	Food and Drug Act in whatever it was, 1916,
13	tobacco wasn’t included in that act because
14	it was no longer considered to have
15	medicinal qualities.
16	Q. What year was that?
17	A. 1916, as far as I know, the
18	Pure Food and Drug Act.
19	Q. The articles I have seen, to
20	be honest, they may have been 1911,1 don’t
21	know. I know I have seen articles from the
22	early 1900s, probably around that. It
2	3	might have been --1 don’t know if it was ;
24	1912 or 1920 or whatever, but it was in the ;
25	early 1900s.	.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I do know because research I
3	have done and my graduate students did as
4	of 1916, it wasn't included in that Pure
5	Food and Drug Act because they no longer ’ 6	considered tobacco to have medicinal
7	qualities.
8	Q, So there was a period of time
9	that you are aware of where they did —
10	where there were groups that — I don't
11	want to say recommended — but groups that
12	encouraged smoking for the potential health
13	benefits?
14	A. Off and on I think you could
15	find references to medicinal qualities, but
16	in this country after 1916, it's not going
17	to be there.
18	Q. Now, when you say there, you
19	would agree you could still find some 2 0	doctors who believe that there were
21	beneficial qualities of smoke even after
22	1916 in the United States?
23	A. Well, I think very often you
2 4	see references to psychological benefits,
2 5	the calming effect perhaps of smoking, die
53
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	fact that, for example, that it was
3	supposed to have a calming impact on
4	soldiers in time of war and time of combat.
5	Q. So in World War One and World
6	War Two people were talking about the other
7	different potential benefits of smoking,
8	the calming affect?
9	A. Yeah. Calming and
L 0	psychological effects of it, yes, you could
L1	find that.
12	Q. Those calming effects that
L 3	were being publicized as being beneficial
L 4	were really the effects of nicotine,
L 5	correct?
L 6 A. Yes, I assume that is the
L7	case.
18	Q. That's what makes cigarettes
L 9	addictive?
2 0	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
21 form. You can answer.
12	A. Yes, ultimately that's what
13	was concluded, but that was long after the
2	4	second World W ar.
25 O. Right. So that's what I'm
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	saying. In World War One and Two they are
3	telling people if you smoke it's good, it
4	will calm you, there’s some benefits to it?
5	A. Not in the way —
6	Q. But they didn’t yet know it
7	was addictive?
8	A. I guess that is the case. It
9	was kind of a side reference to smoking
10	that you could find in certain articles,
11	but there weren't articles that said let’s
12	smoke because it calms soldiers down, or
13	let soldiers smoke because it calms them
14	down.
15	Usually it was a poriferal
16	reference you would find about the calming
17	effect, which of course came from the
18	nicotine, as you have indicated.
19	Q. I see what you are talking
2 0	about and I know what you mean. I forget
21	what it was, it was a general or somebody
2 2	who was saying hey, my men need cigarettes,
23	it’s good for them, it keeps them calm,
2	4	right?
25 A. It was Pershing who said they
55
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	needed cigarettes as much as they needed
3	bullets.
4	Q. That was because of the
5	calming effect?
6	A. He didn't say why, but he did
7	say that, yeah.
8	Q. Now you are smiling.
9	A. Yeah. Well, it's a very
10	famous quote.
11	Q. I'm kidding. You will admit
12	you are smiling now?
13	MR. DAVIS: We will stipulate
14	she is smiling.
15	A. I am smiling because it is
16	such a famous quote. You see it all over.
17	Q. I guess what I was saying is
18	there was a time, and again we are talking
19	about before the 50s and before the 60s;
2 0	after the 50s and 60s there is a lot of
21	research picked up on the adverse health
22	effects and nicotine, what nicotine does
2	3	etcetera, correct?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. Before the 50s if people were
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	smoking or the 40s or the 30s or the 20s
3	and they thought it was calming them, it
4	wasn’t understood from a historical point
5	of view, people didn't really understand
6	that was the effects of nicotine which was
7	in turn the addictive component of tobacco?
8	A. That's probably generally
9	true, yes.
10	Q. But this is — I guess I'm
11	getting off base. This was something
12	that's covered, I guess, peripherally to
13	some extent in some of the survey courses
14	you taught?
15	A. No. As I said, the only time
16	I referenced tobacco reform activity would
17	have been for the survey class, die general
18	survey class in US history for the
19	19th century, then I would have referenced
20	it to a shorter degree in my women's
21	history class in the 1920s during that
2 2	flapper era when women then did begin to
2 3	smoke in greater numbers.
2 4	That would be the only time in
2	5	the 20th century when I would have been
57
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	referring specifically to smoking or tobacco
3	use with reference to women.
4	Q. Have you received any grants?
5	A. For?	' ^
6	Q. In general --
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. . — for anything.
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. What type of things?
11	A. I've received a number of
12	Fulbright grants to do research, I received
13	a Guggenheim fellowship to do research, I
14	have done.
15	Q. What type of research?
16	A. To do research on the subjects
17	that I've mentioned to you previously, such
18	as foreign policy, politics, women, and in
19	the case of die Irish peasant study that I
20	did. ’
21	Q. Have you ever received or
2 2	submitted any grant proposals for smoking
2	3	and health?
24	A. No, I haven't.
25	Q. Have you ever received or_
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	submitted a grant proposal to the National
3	Cancer Institute?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Do you know what they think of
6	the work you are doing in this area?
7	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
8	form.
9	A. No, I don't.
10	Q. Have you heard of that?
11	A. Say it again, the American --
12	Q. The National Cancer Institute.
13	A. Obviously I have heard of it.
14	No. It's within the National Institute of
15	Health.
16	Q. Have you submitted a grant
17	proposal to any organization related to
18	your work or opinions regarding cigarette
19	issues?
20	A. No.
21	Q. What is the purpose of your
22	reliance list?
23	A. It's to show basically the
2	4	comprehensiveness of my research, and it's
25	divided as vou can see into various types
59
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	of either publications or audio visual
3	materials or legislation of one kind or
4	another.
5	It's simply an overview of my
6	research in various areas broken down, as
7	you can see by subject.
8	Q. In Putney and Bonmo did you
9	use mainly the same exhibits in each trial?
10	MR. DAVIS: You said Bonmo.
11	Do you mean Barbinell?
12	Q. Barbinell. I'm sorry.
13	A. Basically, especially the
14	historical material that the reliance list
15	starts with, remains essentially the same,
16	and that's what I was referring to earlier
17	when I said that this research that I did,
18	the historical research, is fairly well in
19	place.
20	The reliance list varied
21	depending on where the plaintiff lived and 2 2	was educated and what either mass media
2	3	print or visual media she or he may have had
24	access to.
O	Dn vnn inr.liidf* — 1 know vnn
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	included the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel.
3	Did you include the Miami Herald as well?
4	A. Yes, for this case.
5	Q. And the Miami News?
6	A. No, not the Miami News.
7	Q. Did you get the articles from
8	Hie Miami and Fort Lauderdale newspapers
9	that talked about the fact that it had not
10	been proven or there were other causes of
11	lung cancer and include those articles on
12	your list?
13	A. Yes, I did.
14	Q. All of them?
15	A. I think probably at least most
16	of them. I researched that paper from '72
17	through -- really through let's say 2000,
18	but probably into 2003, and what I did was
19	to go back and actually look at those
2 0	articles where the headline did refer to
21	the tobacco industry or to the tobacco
2 2	institute or to tobacco companies in
23	general, and it surprised me, but I also
2	4	found this in other newspapers, but in the
25	Sim Sentinel and Fnrt T.anHerHale naneir
61
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	there were at most, let's say, I counted
3	eight, there may have been at most a dozen
4	times where the headline itself referred to
5	the tobacco industry.
6	All the other headlines in the
7	research that I did started out with
8	something about the government report or the
9	health risks of smoking, so I included all
10	of that.
11	Q. Okay. To be honest, I didn't
12	know after 1972 that there were still
13	articles saying it hasn't been proven or
14	there were other causes. I thought most of
15	those articles were really from the 50s and
16	60s.	'
17	A. No. I have references, I
18	think the last one may be for the Fort
19	Lauderdale paper. If I had those notes in 2 0	front of me I could pick it up.
21	MR. DAVIS: Here.
22	A. The last one I have is,
23	actually the headline says Cancer Society
2	4	Spars with Tobacco Institute, and it's from
9	R	Wnvf»mT^pr 1 Qfh 1 QR7
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Then I have the others and they
3	are back in — mostly are in the 70s or the
4	60s, but that was the last one I found.
5	Q. The New York Times in the 50s
6	and the 60s, did you include the articles
7	about it not being proven and so forth and
8	so on?
9	A. Yes, I did in all of the
10	newspapers, but especially the New York
11	Times since it was the first paper I
12	really — well, the first paper I
13	researched was die Indianapolis Star, but
14	the New York Times is the paper of record
15	for the country.
16	Q. What does that mean?
17	A. It means —
18	Q. We always have a problem with
19	that. Nobody knows. We always tell the 2 0	court this is the paper of record, then the
21	judge says what does that mean and we don't
2 2	know.
23	A. What it means is that the New
2 4	York Times, not now necessarily because of
2	5	all the economic cutbacks, but it was the
63
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	newspaper diat carried most of the
3	important stories for the entire country
4	and international stories as well.
5	It was the most comprehensive
6	coverage you can find, and consequently it's
7	held up as a gold standard for all other
8	newspapers, so if you research die Times and
9	you find, as I did, articles going back —
10	well, 1890s really, but the ones that were
11	important for the health hazards of smoking
12	begin in the 30s.
13	I have a whole list of those,
14	and when I do research then in another
15	paper, I look to see how far back these
16	other papers went as far as die coverage
17	compared to the Times.
18	The newspaper of record means
19	it is the most comprehensive coverage you 2 0	can find for national and international
21	news, comes in the New York Times, and so
2 2	you compare all other newspapers to it.
2 3	For example, the Miami Herald
2 4	appears to be die paper of record for
2	5	Florida, and it carries more articles on all
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	topics than the other newspapers seem to do.
3	Q. The Miami Herald?
4	A. Yes. It is die best paper I
5	think for Florida.
6	Q. You know the history of the
7	Miami Herald; it used to be the Miami News
8	and the Miami Herald and they merged?
9	A. I have heard some kind of
10	merger. I have only researched the paper
11	known as the Miami Herald.
12	Q. And the New York Times had a
13	wire service to the Miami News about the
14	Miami Herald, but not for the Miami Herald.
15	A. I did not know that, no.
16	Q. But if that were die case, you
17	would agree that the Miami News and the
18	Miami Herald combined would be the paper of
19	record for Florida?
20	A. It is, yes.
21	Q, Do you dispute that was the
2 2	case? You can look it up on the internet?
23	A. No, I am not disputing it at
2	4	all.
25	O. But if something is covered in
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	the New York Times — this is what I don't
3	understand to be honest --1 don't know if
4	the USA Today is the national paper and
5	people here can get USA Today, you can get
6	it all over die place.
7	Was that land of the deal with
8	the New York Times back in the 50s and 60s,
9	the news in the New York Times would reach
10	areas all over the country because people
11	would subscribe to it all over the country?
12	A. Not because they would
13	subscribe to it necessarily, but newspaper
14	editors all over the country who were
15	working for other newspapers would pick up
16	these stories.
17	Many of the New York Times
18	stories were AP stories, Associated Press
19	stories, and editors in other parts of the 2 0	country would have had access to those
21	stories, but if for example in my hometown,
22	Butte, Montana, in die 1950s when I was
2 3	growing up I could buy or my family could
2 4	buy the New York Times in Butte, Montana. 1
2	5	can't buy it there today, but I could in the
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	1950s because it was circulated widely, but
3	largely because local newspaper editors used
4	it as the standard for what they were going
5	to put in their local newspapers.
6	Q. That's what I heard, it was
7	distributed all over the country in the 50s
8	and 60s.
9	A. Yes, but even if it weren't in L0	a rural area die editors for newspapers
L1	serving those areas would have access to
12	these stories.
L 3 Q. But people might not read —
L 4	that each particular story may not be
L 5	picked up in each particular paper?
L 6 A. True.
L 7 Q. But the information in the New
L 8	York Times would pretty much be
L 9	disseminated throughout the country for a
10	variety of means?
11	A. Yes, either through the
12	Associated Press teletype type of stuff or
13	tlirough the hard copy itself.
14	Q. Did you include advertisements
15	from the tobacco companies?
67
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. You see them in the rungs of
3	die various newspapers, yes.
4	Q. But why did you include those?
5	A. Simply because they were part
6	of my research.
7	Q. Do you agree that
8	advertisements helped shape public opinions
9	and beliefs to a certain extent?
10	A. 1 think it's simply one piece
11	or component of information.
12	Q. It was one — you agree that
13	advertisements were one source of
14	information that helped form public
15	opinions and public beliefs?
16	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
17	Beyond her scope of expertise.
18	A. It is one source of
19	information, that's all I can say about it,
2 0	because there were so many other sources of
21	information on the subject at the time.
22	Q. Right. But you are going to
23	be talking about — are you going to be
2	4	talking about beliefs, awareness and
25	belief?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Not belief.
3	Q. You are going to be talking
4	about awareness?
5	A. The type of research I do is
6	social and cultural historical research,
7	only allows you to talk about general
8	awareness.
9	Q. You are going to talk about
10	awareness?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. You would agree the
13	advertisements from the tobacco companies
14	were one source of information that helped
15	shape public awareness?
16	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
17	You can answer.
18	A. One component part of how much
19	it shaped public awareness is, I think,
20	something we could discuss.
21	Q, We will, but do you know how
22	much money the tobacco companies spent on
23	their advertisements in the 40s and 50s?
24	A. No, I don't.
25	Q. Do you know how prevalent the
69
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	tobacco advertisements saying more doctors
3	smoke Camels were on TV in the 40s and 50s?
4	A. I think those were primarily
5	in the 50s, and they stopped as of'56.
6	No, I don't know how prevalent
7	they were, but there were some in the 50s.
8	Q. Do you think that did not have
9	an impact on people's awareness of the
10	health hazards of smoking?
11	A. I think that is an interesting
12	question, because given the fact that
13	people don’t read these ads widi a blank
14	mind, that they already have information
15	about smoking either coming from their
16	education or coming from popular culture,
17	that I don't know, not being an expert on
18	ads, but it seems to me if you saw an ad
19	that said more doctors smoke, I guess it
2 0	was Camels, than any other cigarette, you
21	might think are the other cigarettes unsafe
22	or why is it, is there something wrong with 2 3	cigarettes that you have to go and get a
2 4	doctor to attest to it, so I don't know is
2	5	mv answer to that. I think --
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Ma'am, first of all, you are
3	not a psychologist, correct?
4	A. Right.
5	Q. You are only talking about
6	awareness, correct?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. You know there were ads from
9	other companies that say more scientists
10	smoke this brand or more educators smoke
11	that brand, so it wasn't only more doctors
12	smoke, it was more everybody smoked, right?
13	You had athlete smoking, you
14	had movie star smoking, advertisements
15	saying teachers smoke our brand and doctors
16	smoke our brand, right?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Do you think that those ads
19	back in the 40s and the 50s impacted public 2 0	awareness on the health hazards or not?
21	A. I can only say that they would
2 2	have been read by people who already were
23	aware that there were hazards associated
2	4	with smoking, and consequently it's
25	difficult to know how much of an iniDact
71
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	those kinds of ads had. Maybe ad experts
3	could tell you, but I can't.
4	Q. Well, you know, there's a big
5	difference between awareness and belief,
6	right?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. Do you know who the Gallop
9	Organization is?
10	A. Yes.
11	Q. You have relied on some of
12	their polls?
13	A. I have relied on very few, and
14	only on those questions where they were
15	asking about general awareness.
16	Q. Ma'am, you relied on some of
17	their polls, correct?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. You know they have criticized 2 0	other tobacco historians who took their
21	polls out of context, don't you?
22	MR. DAVIS: I object to the 2 3 form of the question.
2	4 A. Not sure I understood the
25	Question. Sav it aeain.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Did you know the Gallop
3	Organization issued a paper and a letter
4	and also was covered in the Wall Street
5	Journal that they had an issue with tobacco
6	historians who talked about awareness out
7	of context and didn't talk about belief
8	levels at the same time?
9	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
10	form of the question.
11	A. No, I don’t know that.
12	Q. Well, if you are going to be
13	talking about polls, don’t you want to talk
14	about them in the context in which the
15	Gallop Organization requires you to do so?
16	A. When did this story occur?
17	Q. In the 90s.
18	A. No, 1 don't know about the
19	story, and the very selective use and —
20	use I made of the Gallop polls in the 50s,
21	I don't think I used them out of context.
22	Q. Actually, that was one of the
23	issues they had, was that there was a
2	4	historian who was talking about awareness.
25	In the Daner that thev wrote.
73
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	they said what the historian is saying is
3	that 85 or 90 percent of the people were
4	aware that cigarettes may cause cancer, but
5	that doesn’t mean anything, because in the
6	same poll or other polls, it's been proven
7	that 90 to 95 percent of the people are
8	aware of flying saucers, and that doesn't
9	mean people believe that to be so.
10	So the moral of the story was
11	if you are going to tell a juiy about
12	awareness, you have to tell them about
13	belief levels and put things in proper
14	context and not mislead the juiy.
15	They specifically say you are
16	not going to mislead a jury. It is in die
17	letter. Would you like a copy?
18	A. I wouldn't mind a copy.
19	Q. If I send a copy to your 2 0	lawyer will you read it?
21	A. Sure.
22	Q. Okay. There is a letter I am 2 3	going to send to him, a paper, a
2 4	presentation and a Wall Street Journal
2	5	article put out by the Gallop Organization
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	specifically criticizing a historian from
3	doing what you are telling me you did,
4	talking about awareness and not beliefs.
5	A. What I said is I very
6	selectively and very seldom use polls, and
7	the only reason I site the polls I do in my
8	reliance materials is that in the 1950s
9	widi these scientific studies that came . 0	out, the Gallop poll, the results on
. 1	awareness, were reported in the newspapers,
.2	and so that's how I came across that
. 3	material, and Gallop himself was quoted in
. 4	1957 in one of these awareness polls
. 5	indicating how high he thought that
. 6	percentage was, but it’s only to really
. 7	confirm the generalization I had already
. 8	come to about increased general awareness
.9	in the 1950s.
! 0	That's the only way I have used
! 1	these polls. I don't think I have used them
!2	out of context at all for the reporting on
! 3	the polls in the 1950s.
! 4 Q. The awareness that you have,
!5	you have a 1954 poll, have you read or
75
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	heard anything to the effect that
3	cigarettes may be a cause of lung cancer,
4	and 90 percent said they had heard or read
5	diat cigarettes may be a cause of lung
6	cancer, right?
7	A. Well, that was I think the
8	June poll. There was a previous one in
9	January that was slightly lower. Yes, both
10	general awareness questions.
L1	MR. DAVIS: Gary, when you get
L 2 to a breaking point I need to take a L 3 short break.
L 4	MR. PAIGE: We can take one
L 5 now.
L 6	(A short recess was taken.)
L 7 Q. Professor, did you speak to
L 8	the lawyer during the break about the case?
L9 A. Yes.
20	Q. What did you talk about?
21	A. About the deposition.
22	Q. What?
23	A. I was told that I should
2 4	listen more carefully to your question, to
2	5	the wording of the Question and answer it
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	more directly so we could get through the
3	deposition in a reasonable length of time.
4	Q. So he told you that or you
5	told him that?
6	A. He told me that. I thought it
7	was good advice.
8	Q. Me too. Anything specific
9	though; did he talk about any specific
10	questions you should anticipate how to
11	answer something?
12	A. No.
13	Q. This poll I'm looking at is
14	the June 1954 -- you're right actually, I
15	should look at the January — it's a
16	June 1954 poll that says: Have you heard
17	or read anything recently to the effect
18	diat cigarette smoking may be a cause of
19	cancer to the lung, and 90 percent of the
20	people said yes, they had heard something
21	that that may be possible, correct?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. It's not like they are saying
24	yes, I heard it, they are saying they heard
25	it mav?
77
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. They heard it may. It was a
3	specific reference to die Hammond and Horn
4	report that came out in June.
5	Q. So there were a lot of people
6	in 1954 who had heard that cigarettes make
7	cause lung cancer?
8	A. Aware of die report, yes, it
9	may cause.
LO Q. That was news at the time
L1	because that was something pretty important
12	and pretty new?
L 3 A. It was news at the time
14	because of the fact that so many people
L5	were generally aware of a single scientific
L 6	report and Gallop, as I said, himself was
L7	impressed with these high numbers.
L 8 Q. Maybe I wasn't clear; that was
L 9	the news of the fact that cigarettes may
20	cause lung cancer was important at that
21	time?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. And that was pretty big news
24	and it was something diat was new to people
25	whn were and a lnt nf nennle were
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	smoking, right?
3	A. Right.
4	Q. I think at that time it was
5	like 68 percent of men were smoking, right?
6	A. I don't know if it was as high
7	as 68 percent. It was well over 40 I know.
8	Q. Around that time, more or less
9	around that time there were ads saying more
10	doctors smoke one brand, correct?
11	A. In 1954 you could still find
12	those ads, yes.
13	Q. There were a higher percentage
14	of doctors, I think it was like 70 percent
15	of doctors, were smoking at that time,
16	correct?
17	A. I don’t know if it was that
18	high. They were smoking, yes.
19	Q. More than half of the doctors
20	in America were smoking, correct?
21	A. I think so.
22	Q. Which is vastly different
23	today; I think it would be very hard to 2 4	fmd doctors who smoke today.
2	5 A. I don't know. I assume that's
79
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	the case. I know a doctor in Montana who
3	smokes.
4	Q. If I went to a doctor who
5	smoked, I probably would go to a different
6	doctor. You would agree the vast majority
7	of doctors do not smoke now?
8	A. I would think so, that’s the
9	case.
10	Q. So it was a different world
11	back then in terms of people’s beliefs
12	about the link between smoking and deadly
13	disease —
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. — than it is today?
16	A. Yes.	'
17	Q. At the time of that poll there
18	were ads of more doctors smoked, there were
19	also ads that teachers smoked certain
2 0	brands and scientists smoked other brands,
21	correct?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. So there was also an
2	4	awareness — although we don't have a poll
25	on it — there was an awareness to the
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	public that certain doctors, educators,
3	scientists, movie stars and sports figures
4	were smoking as well?
5	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
6	It's compound.
7	A. Yes. Those kinds of ads
8	existed, but as I said previously, people
9	would have been reading them with other
10	information in their heads as well or
11	general awareness about the fact that there
12	was a problem with cigarettes.
13	Q. I'm trying to get to a
14	question, that's why I'm asking. There was
15	an awareness of the study that smoking may
16	cause lung cancer?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. This was in 1954, correct?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. And around that time there is
21	also an awareness that diere was coverage 2 2	that smoking may not cause lung cancer,
2 3	correct?
2	4 A. In die poll are you referring
25	to?	*	"
81
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. No. In general. You know
3	about a frank statement that was published?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. There was also an awareness in
6	the public domain that smoking may not
7	cause lung cancer, correct?
8	A. There was information out
9	there. It wasn't covered in a particular
10	general awareness poll, if that's what
11	you're saying.
12	Q. I am not saying that. Iam
13	saying aside from the poll, because of die
14	poll we know 90 percent of the people were
15	aware that smoking may cause lung cancer,
16	correct?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. But because of die information
19	you reviewed, you know there was a certain 2 0	percentage of people — we don't know the
21	number — but we know there were people
2 2	aware diat smoking may not cause lung
2 3	cancer as well, correct?
2	4 A. Yes.
25	Q. It's been referred to as the
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	cigarette controversy. There was a
3	controversy in the 50s and 60s, correct?
4	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
5	form.
6	A. There was, and my reliance
7	materials indicate a debate, not simply
8	between say tobacco companies or their
9	representatives and scientists, but there
L 0	was a debate in the 1950s among scientists
L1	and —
L2 Q. I know that.
L 3 A. And that debate is in the
L 4	reliance materials, yes.
15	Q. I know that. But I am asking
L 6	you --1 know what the cigarette companies
L 7	knew because I read their documents. You
L8	haven't read their documents, right?
L 9 A. Right.
20	Q. What I’m saying is in the 50s
11	and the 60s there was a controversy amongst
12	people, the public, which included
23	cigarette companies and doctors and general
14	people as to whether or not cigarettes
15	caused lung cancer or not?
83
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Well, as I said, I think there
3	was a debate in the 50s in particular. The
4	debate becomes less and less as you go
5	forward.
6	Q. Let’s talk about the 50s. You
7	would agree in the 50s through 1964, at
8	least up until the surgeon general's report
9	in '64, in that time period there was a
10	debate or controversy in the public domain
11	about whether smoking causes lung cancer?
12	MR. DAVIS: Objection.
13	Compound.
14	A. Generally speaking, yes.
15	Q, Although in 1954 people were
16	aware of this study that was polled, they
17	were also aware of other information saying
18	it had not been proven, more research was
19	needed, things of that nature, correct?
20	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
21	Compound.
22	A. They would have had access to 2 3	some of that opinion, yes.
2 4 Q. In fact, in 1954, there's a
2	5	noil on vour reliance material in June of
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	'54 that said: Do you think smoking is one
3	of the causes of lung cancer or not; that
4	is a belief poll, correct?
5	A. Yes, it is. It is a causation
6	poll.
7	Q. At that time only 39 percent
8	of the people polled said they believed it,
9	correct?
10	A. I thought it was 41 percent,
11	but 39 is close enough.
12	Q. I'm reading it. It's
13	39 percent.
14	A. The figure I had, I thought it
15	was 41.
16	Q. I'm looking at June '54.
17	A. I know.
18	Q. But it doesn't matter.
19	40 percent — roughly
20	40 percent of the people believed that
21	smoking caused lung cancer at that time,
2 2	correct?
23	A. Yes. When it was asked do you
2	4	think, yes.
25	O. The belief levels amone
85
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	smokers -- that was a belief question asked
3	of smokers and nonsmokers, correct?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. Generally the belief level of
6	smokers about the link between smoke and
7	lung cancer is generally lower than that of
8	nonsmokers, correct?
9	A. It's generally lower, but I
10	thought that poll showed it higher.
11	Q. I don't know that. I don't
12	see that on your reliance list.
13	A. I haven't included it, but I
14	have looked very carefully at that '54 poll
15	in terms of the awareness question and then
16	the causation or belief question, and it
17	was --1 have in my mind in that particular
18	poll the nonsmokers ranked higher in terms
19	of belief.
20	Q. Nonsmokers are generally
21	believed --
22	A. I'm sorry. That the smokers 2 3	ranked higher in the belief. I may be
2 4	wrong. I thought that was the case in that
2	5	one noil.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. I don't know if that is die
3	case in that poll, but generally we know
4	throughout various polls over time the
5	belief levels of smokers are lower than
6	nonsniokers?
7	A. Yes. That is generally true.
8	Q. For whatever reason. It might
9	be because diey are addicted and they're
10	rationalizing, who really knows, correct?
11	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. In June of '54 when asked that
14	question, 60 percent of the public either
15	didn't believe it or didn't know or were
16	unsure one way or die other?
17	A. Yeah. If you look at the
18	unsure figure, what was that?
19	Q. It was 28 percent.
20	A. It was noted in a couple of
21	the articles that that was very high
2 2	percentage of not sure, meaning, I think,
2 3	that given die studies diat had come out
2 4	and the way in which people were fearful to
2	5	a certain deeree of cancer in the 195ns
87
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	generally speaking, that diat not sure
3	figure was probably an indication diat they
4	were thinking about it, and it could be
5	thrown in with the 39 or 40 percent who
6	actually expressed a belief that it did
7	cause cancer, lung cancer.
8	Q. I have taken probably 20 depos
9	of historians and polling experts, and I
10	have never heard anybody say that before,
11	ever. Ever. Are you a polling expert?
12	A. No, I am not a polling expert,
13	but I have read that that was a high unsure
14	figure and that —
15	Q. I understand that.
16	A. That’s all I am saying.
17	Q. That’s not all you said. You
18	said we should take that number and throw
19	it in widi the people who thought it was
20	so. Why would you do diat other than to
21	help die tobacco companies and to try to 2 2	hurt the victims?
2 3	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
2	4 form of the question. It is
25	aronmentative. You can answer
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I thought you were indicaring
3	the other two figures, the 28 percent and
4	whatever the odier figure was, as
5	indications then that this was — that they
6	both were negative responses to whether or
7	not people thought diere was a link between
8	lung cancer and smoking.
9	Q. That's a problem, because you
10	keep trying to guess what I mean, because I
11	didn't say diat. I didn't mean diat.
12	MR. DAVIS: There is no
13	question.
14	A. Okay.
15	Q. So my question is tiiere was
16	roughly 40 percent of the people who
17	believed it and there was 60 percent of the
18	people who either didn't believe it or who
19	were unsure, correct?
2 0 A. Yes.
21	Q. The 60 percent of people in
2 2	1954 who represented the people who didn't
2 3	believe it or were unsure whether there was
24	a link between smoking and cancer
2	5	renresented tens of millions of tteoDle.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	correct?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. There was, I think, roughly
5	150 million Americans at that time?
6	A. I diink that's right for 1954,
7	150 or 60.
8	Q. So that would mean there would
9	be roughly 90 million Americans who were
10	walking around at that time who didn't
11	believe smoking caused lung cancer or who
12	were unsure about that, correct?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. That was a high percentage for
15	that -- let me rephrase it.
16	Today the level of belief is
17	much different than what it was in the 50s
18	and 60s?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. Today virtually everybody
21	knows that smoking causes lung cancer?
22	A. Yes.
23	Q. Even my 6-year-old daughter is
24	pretty convinced smoking causes cancer.
25	That wasn't so in the 50s and 60s.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	MR. DAVIS: There's no
3	question.
4	Q. Have you looked at the belief
5	polls from the 60s and 70s and 80s and just
6	removed them from your reliance materials
7	in this case but have relied upon them in
8	other cases?
9	A. No. I have not used them in L 0	any other case.
.1 Q. Have you looked at the other
-2	Gallop polls from the 60s and 70s?
.3 A. No. I have looked only at the
L 4	general reliance for the 50s because they
15	were reported on in the mass media.
16	Otherwise I wouldn't have looked at them at
17	all.
L8 Q. What is the Bricker Amendment?
L 9 A. The Bricker Amendment I
10	thought had to do with foreign policy.
11	Q. I don't know. Is that what it
12	is?
13	A. Yes.
’4 Q. So you would be one of the
15	28 percent? You wrote on your reliance
91
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	materials, people heard or read it in the
3	Bricker Amendment, there was 28 percent
4	that said yes?
5	A. The Bricker Amendment was
6	where they wanted Congress not to be able
7	to declare war unless there was a national
8	referendum for war going back to the Ludlow
9	Amendment of the 1930s.
L 0	Q. Then you have a question here :
11	in 1954, and I think this was another :
i	2	area — I am going by memory, I am going to 1
L 3	send you the letter, the study and the Wall '
L 4	Street Journal article from the Gallop '
15	Organization, I think it was from 1999,1 '
L 6	am not positive, I am going by memoiy — !
17	but one of the things they had an issue '
L 8	with I believe is — I'm not swearing to !
L 9	it ~ is that you have a poll here, the :
10	question says, do you think cigarettes are	)
11	harmful or not, you said 70 percent of the	1
12	people said yes and 23 percent said no, and )
13	it's from January 1954. Do you remember 1
14	that?	■
25	A. Yes, I do, because that was in I
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	reference to the Mouse report or the Mouse
3	study.
4	Q. Do you know that the follow-up
5	question they asked people, in what way do
6	you think cigarettes are harmful? Do you
7	know tiiat?
8	A. I think I do, but you would
9	have to refresh my memory on the question
10	itself, how was it worded?
11	Q. I don't have it with me, but
12	from memory they pretty much asked people
13	if — it's an open-ended question — in
14	what way do you think smoking is harmful.
15	I think 5 percent of the 70 percent
16	indicated it causes lung cancer. Do you
17	remember that?
18	MR. DAVIS: Gary, I would like
19	to give her the document, put it in 2 0 front of her if that's okay.
21	MR. PAIGE: Do you have it?
22	MR. DAVIS: I have the
23	reliance materials, if this is your 2 4 reliance materials.
2	5 O. I don't know, is the follow-up
93
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	question — when I pulled up this the
3	follow-up question didn’t come up with it.
4	A. I don’t think that follow
5	up-question is there. I think only the
6	general awareness question is there.
7	Q. What do you get from this?
8	You’re putting this on your
9	reliance material, you think 70 percent of
L0	the people thought smoking was harmful. In
L1	what way did they think it was harmful?
L2 A. All polls are simply snapshot
L 3	indications of opinions at a very
L 4	particular time on a very particular
L 5	subject, and you have to look at the
L 6	wording carefully.
L 7	I am not an ad expert, but I
L8	know wording counts, and in this instance
L 9	both the polls I site are general awareness
10	polls specifically asking people if they
11	have heard about a report that may indicate
12	a cause that lung cancer comes from smoking,
13	and they had heard about die Mouse report,
14	and that's the January awareness poll, and
15	thev had heard about the Hammond and Horn
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	report, and that is the June poll. Those
3	are the only two I list.
4	Q. Ma'am, my question to you is
5	in January of '54 you listed a question
6	that said do you think cigarette smoking is
7	harmful or not. 70 percent of the 1,500
8	people interviewed said yes, so that means
9	they interviewed 1,500 people, roughly
10	1,000 people said yes, they think smoking
11	is harmful, the other 500 didn't think it
12	was harmful, correct?
13	A. Yes, but that's not on my
14	reliance list.
15	Q. No, it is. You have
16	70 percent said yes, 23 percent no,
17	6 percent had no opinion, so of the 1,500
18	people interviewed, 1,000 people roughly
19	thought cigarettes were harmful, right?
20	A. Yes. They were generally
21	aware of a report, yes.
22	Q. That's not the question. It
2 3	says 70 percent of the people said yes,
2 4	they think cigarette smoking is harmful,
2	5	correct?
95
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I guess so. The reference on
3	my reliance material is have you recently
4	heard of a report that smoking may cause
5	lung cancer. That's where it’s 83 percent,
6	then it goes up to 90 percent. This is
7	another question.
8	Q. Right. This is a question
9	that you had on your reliance materials.
10	MR. DAVIS: Do you have this?
11	A. I don't think it is on the
12	reliance materials. I think only the two
13	other questions are.
14	Q. I printed it from your
15	reliance materials. I have it.
16	MR. DAVIS: Can you tell me
17	where it is? I can show it to you.
18	MR. PAIGE: There is one page
19	of hers that has polls. You only have 2 0 like four or five polls. There wasn't
21	that many. It's not that hard to
2 2 find. It was probably the first or 2 3 second disk. Do you know which disk
2	4 it would be on?
25	THE WITNESS: Probably the
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	last one.
3	MR. PAIGE: No, I don't think
4	it was the last poll. I thought it
5	was the second disk. I don't know.
6	I'm going by memory. Whatever.
7	MR. DAVIS: Just a second. I
8	am going to try and pull this up.
9	(Pause.)
10	MR. PAIGE: While he is doing
11	that I will ask you a few other
12	questions, okay?
13	THE WITNESS: That’s fine.
14	Q. Did you ever look at any of
15	the internal documents of the cigarette
16	companies?
17	A. No, I have not.
18	Q. You have been doing work for
19	them for 15 years, you never thought it 2 0	might be interesting or helpful to look at
21	their internal documents? They are
2 2	available online for free.
23	A. I understand that. I know
2 4	that.
2	5	Q. You never wanted to see them?
97
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. No, because unless they were
3	reported and part of the general awareness
4	research 1 was doing, they are not
5	important for the conclusions I arrived at
6	in terms of general awareness.
7	Q. You're not interested in
8	seeing anything about the people who were
9	paying you money to land of know what they
10	were — to know what you're getting
11	yourself into?
12	MR. DAVIS: Objection.
13	Argumentative.
14	A. I am paid to do research on
15	general awareness, not to study internal
16	documents of any company.
17	Q. This has been covered in the
18	news. The conduct of the cigarette
19	companies has been covered in the news
20	extensively since 2000.
21	You never were interested to
22	look online for free and look at their
23	documents?
2	4 MR. DAVIS: I object to the
25	form of the question. Argumentative. _
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. It is not a part of my
3	research.
4	Q. Were you ever told not to do
5	that?
6	A. No, I was not.
7	Q. Did you know that none of the
8	historians I have ever come across hired by
9	tobacco companies have ever glanced at the
10	tobacco documents?
i	1 A. They have not?
12	Q. They have not Do you know
13	that?
14	A. No, 1 didn't know that.
15	Q. Just a coincidence, none of
16	you want to look at die documents?
L7	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
L 8 Argumentative.
L 9 A. To die degree they are doing
20	the kind of social and cultural research I
21	am doing, there wouldn't be any need or
22	necessity for looking at internal tobacco
23	documents unless they were made public at a
24	time that contributed to the general
15	awareness of the plaintiff in this case or
99
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	other cases.
3	Q. I know that, but diere have
4	been movies about their documents, books
5	about their documents, they are available
6	online. You have been doing work for 15
7	years for diese companies. I really find
8	it strange diat unless somebody told you
9	don't do it that you just took it upon
10	yourself to never look at them, that you
11	have no interest in doing it. Is diat
12	really the case?
13	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
14	form of the question. Argumentative.
15	A. It is the case, because there
16	was no need for me to do it. You have to
17	think about in the last 15 years I have
18	been researching so many other topics.
19	There was no need for me to research an
2 0	internal document that wasn't necessary for :
21	my research on general awareness.	;
22	I was writing other books in	; 2 3	that time period. I am just not sitting I
2	4	around thinking about internal tobacco !
25	documents in the last 15 years. i
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. You can go online and say I
3	would like to see the 100 most important
4	tobacco documents. They will come up.
5	It's not that hard to find diem.
6	There's some pretty interesting
7	stuff. They talk about things you are
8	talking about, what smokers know, what they
9	don't know. There's things in the documents
10	that talk about what type of information to
11	provide smokers so they will continue
12	smoking. You never thought it would help
13	you to look at those or interest you in any
14	way?
15	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
16	A. Not unless it showed up in the
17	time period I was studying or in general
18	awareness.
19	Q. The documents were written
20	during that time period. Yes, they were.
21	A. I know that.
22	Q. How do you know that?
23	A. From the book reviews that I
2 4	read and from the television coverage that
2	5	came after 1994.
101
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Did you know that the tobacco
3	companies had a detailed plan to provide
4	doubt and confusion to smokers?
5	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
6	A. No.
7	Q. Do you know that they carried
8	out -- that Phillip Morris had a
9	representative that said after the surgeon L0	general report in 1964 that we need to
L1	provide addictive smokers with
12	psychological crutches and rationals to
L 3	keep them smoking?
L 4	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
15	A. No.
16	Q. Do you know whether they knew
L 7	how many people were dying and how much
L 8	money they were making when they were
L 9	making those statements to each other
20	behind closed doors?
11	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
22	A. I don't know, because J
23	haven't looked at those documents.
24	Q. As a human being you don't
2	5	want to know about that?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
3	form of the question.
4	A. As a human being or as a
5	researcher, I have to limit what I am
6	looking at as a researcher, not as a human
7	being. You know, I have a mild interest in
8	it, but it's not a major concern of mine.
9	Q. Well, do you smoke?
10	A. No, I don't.
11	Q. Do you have family members who
12	smokes?
13	A. My brother used to smoke and
14	my ex-husband used to smoke and neither do
15	now.
16	Q. Your parents?
17	A. My parents didn't smoke.
18	MR. DAVIS: We have die poll
19	in front of us now.
20	Q. When did your brother quit?
21	A. He quit a good 20 years ago.
22	Q. Did you ever know anybody,
2 3	close family member or friend who was
24	addicted to smoking and suffered a horrible
2	5	death from that?
103
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
3	A. No. 1 had a personal friend I
4	went to college with who actually stopped
5	smoking. Oh, I don't know, he died in 1993
6	from lung cancer, and he stopped smoking 10
7	or 15 years before that, so the answer to
8	the question is yes.
9	Q. You still have no interest in
10	seeing what they did to get people to
11	smoke?
12	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
13	form.
14	A. Not a part of my research.
15	Q. Do you have that poll in front
16	of you, the 1954 poll?
17	MR. DAVIS: This is this the
18	one?
19	THE WITNESS: Yes.
20	Q. Do you think cigarette smoking
21	is harmful, yes or no; do you see that?
22	A. Alright. Yes.
2 3 Q. Do you think cigarette smoking
24	is harmful, correct; do you see that on
2	5	your reliance materials?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. And 70 percent or 1,000,
4	roughy 1,000 of people polled which was —
5	do you agree with the sample as a fair
6	representation that was used in this poll?
7	A. I don’t know. I'm assuming
8	Gallop -- it's there, 1,500 was a
9	representative sample.
10	Q. 1,000 people or more they
11	thought smoke was harmful at that time,
12	correct?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. And there was roughly 500
15	people who said either they thought it
16	wasn’t or they just didn't know one way or
17	the other, correct?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. Of the 1,000 people who
2 0	thought it was harmful -- since you are
21	going to be testifying in front of the jury
22	about these issues — do you know in what 2 3	way they thought smoking was harmful?
2 4 A. Not from that question, no.
2	5 Q. Do you know what the next
105
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	question was?
3	(Pause.)
4	A. Then we have the one that you
5	were siting, do you think cigarette smoking
6	is one of the causes, then that's the
7	41 percent that I was referencing.
8	Q, Generally looking at the
9	polls, do you know — they ask people do
10	you think it was harmful. Are you familiar
11	with what the public has in the 50s — I
12	don't know, I don't have the whole '54
13	poll, I don't know if it's the Januaiy,
14	June or the 1956 poll, but diere are polls
15	I have seen that ask the same exact
16	question, that give pretty much the same
17	answer, and there is a follow-up question
18	and people do list what they think is
19	harmful.
20	Is it your understanding or are
21	you going to testify that you think that the 2 2	harmful thing that people are talking about 2 3	here is lung cancer? Is that what you think 2 4	that means?
2	5	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	form of the question. You can answer.
3	A. In the two polls that I
4	referenced, drey do say may be a cause or
5	may be linked to lung cancer. The wording
6	is there, so the answer is yes in those two
7	awareness polls.
8	Q. Those are different questions.
9	I am asking you this question, where they . 0	asked people do you think it's harmful, do
. 1	you think the people are talking about lung
. 2	cancer or something else or do you not
. 3	know?
A A. I don't know.
.5 Q. Would you be interested to see . 6 if there are polls where they ask people to
. 7	explain what harmful means and they list
. 8	things such as bad breath, yellow teeth,
. 9	makes you nervous, impolite, costs too
! 0	much, and lung cancer? Would you be
! 1	interested in seeing that?
! 2	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
! 3 form.
! 4 A. Not unless that kind of poll
! 5	was reported in the national media as the
107
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	two polls were which I site.
3	Q. Was this question published in
4	the media, do you think smoking is harmful?
5	You diink that was published in the media?
6	A. That question, the causation
7	question, die belief question was not
8	commented on in the national media.
9	The question that was commented
10	on by the national media or any land of
11	headline, the stories were the two awareness '
12	polls, because the percentages were so high ' L 3	because of these two scientific studies that
L 4	had been publicized. !
L 5	Q. Ma’am, my question to you is '
L 6	would you dispute the fact that Gallop '
L 7	reported in their own polls when they asked !
L 8	1,500 people in the 1950s if you think
L 9	smoking was harmful, only 50 individuals ’
10	listed lung cancer as a reason as to why	I
11	they thought it was harmful. Would you	\
12	dispute that?	1
13	MR. DAVIS: I object to the	!
24	form.
25	A. If you have that question in	!
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	front of you I wouldn't dispute it, no.
3	Q. If you can answer these
4	questions directly, we will go a lot
5	quicker.
6	I am anticipating you are going
7	to give me a long answer to this, and I know
8	we are going to go back and forth, and I
9	know what the answer ultimately is.
10	You listed certain textbooks on
11	your reliance materials, correct?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. Can you show me which ones you
14	specifically know were used in classrooms
15	or schools that Ellen Tate attended while
16	she was there?
17	A. The ones that I list were the
18	mandated textbooks, so some of them, not
19	all of them would have been used in the
2 0	grade school and high school she attended
21	in Brooklyn.
22	Q. Ma'am, I want to know if you
2 3	can show me which ones Ellen Tate used or
2	4	were used in her classrooms. Do you know
25	or not?
109
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I can't give you the specific
3	ones that would have been used in her
4	classroom. No, I cannot,
5	Q. Can you tell me out of these
6	five I know one of diem was used, something
7	like that?
8	A. Yes. One of them had to be,
9	because they were mandated textbooks.
L0 Q. How many do you have listed on
LI	your reliance list?
L 2 A. I think at least I have — I
L3	think there are a good maybe six listed on
L 4	the reliance list, Burkhart & Wheat and a
L5	few others.
L 6 Q. Of those six that are listed,
L 7	you can say one of them, you just don't
L 8	know which one was used in her classroom?
L 9 A. Yes, because New York had such
2	0	a systematic educational system.
21	Q. You don't have to explain.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. You have six listed on your
14	reliance materials?
15	A. Six or eight that are listed.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. So when you were going to
3	testify in court, lilce how do you pick
4	which of the eight you use to talk to the
5	jury about if you don't know which ones she
6	used?
7	A. What I did was to look at
8	diose textbooks by authors or author where
9	you see them reoccurring decade after
10	decade, so the Burkhart textbook was a very
11	popular one which was mandated. In all
12	likelihood it was used in classes she might
13	have attended.
14	The Wheat book was particularly
15	good because it indicated to students not
16	only the health hazards of smoking, but it
17	also indicated to them about how to read
18	ads, and how to analyze ads because -- and
19	the Wheat book was also interesting because 2 0	it addressed the question of immigrant
21	students, so New York State was ahead of
22	most states in terms of how to teach the
23	problems of health associated either with
2	4	smoldng or with other activities in society.
25	Q. That doesn't answer my
111
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	question.
3	You don't know which ones she
4	reviewed, and die eight ones you are going
5	to use are Burkhart —
6	A. And Wheat and a few others.
7	Q. You're going to show the jury
8	all eight of them, do you anticipate doing
9	that at trial?
10	A. No. I tiiink in a previous
11	case we selected I think two or three
12	examples of the textbooks, of the mandated
13	textbooks.
L 4 Q. Which ones did you use?
15	A. We used Burkhart I know and I
L 6	think we used Wheat.
L 7 Q. And the other six, is there a
L 8	reason why you didn't use them?
L 9 A. No. I think the Burkhart text
2 0	had I think perhaps better illustrations,
21	and the Wheat textbook because it had a
22	wider variety of ways to teach health	.
23	problems.	,
24	Q. We are talking about in 2010.	.
2	5	I think we talked about earlier, you may .
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	recall, everybody is aware of the health
3	scare, the deadly diseases and disabling
4	diseases caused by smoldng, correct?
5	A. Yes. '
6	Q. When did that really occur?
7	When did that start occurring in society,
8	when the public really started hearing or
9	it really started catching onto cigarettes
10	may cause deadly and/or disabling diseases?
11	A. Well, I think that when it
12	really becomes, as sometimes it's referred
13	to a cancer scare, was in the 1950s because
14	of these scientific studies.
15	What I think is helpful to
16	place into context is the 50s was a
17	particularly fearful decade, people were
18	afraid of communism, afraid of the atomic
19	bomb and nuclear weapons.
20	Q. I am going to ask you die
21	question all over again when you do this.
22	A. I have to do this because of
23	the decade 1 am talking about.
2 4 Q. You don't have to do it, you
2	5	don't.
113
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. It was a fearful decade. I
3	diink the cancer scare became more evident
4	and was more popularized because of these
5	other fears. That's unique to this decade.
6	Q. Ma'am, I will ask you about
7	the fearful decade if that makes you feel
8	better, but I don’t really care about that
9	and I have never heard that before, and I
10	have talked to historians who had studied
11	only cigarettes.
12	If you want to talk about the
13	fearfiilness of the 50s, knock yourself out,
14	but that wasn't my question. We should take
15	a break for lunch, because there's no way I
16	am finishing by 2:00. I don't know if you
17	guys want to take a break at 1:00 or 1:30,
18	let me know because I am going to make
19	plans.
20	MR. DAVIS: Let's make it
21	1:00, if you give me two minutes to 2 2 order. Let's take a three minute
23 break now and we'll resume.
2 4	MR. PAIGE: Okay.
25	(A short recess was taken.)
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Back to what I was asking you;
3	when did the scare about cigarettes causing
4	deadly or disabling diseases begin in
5	America?
6	A. In the 1950s.
7	Q. And prior to the 1950s, I want
8	to talk about prior to the 1950s, I think
9	it was 1953 that that study — strike
10	that — the main study that came out or the
11	first big study that came out that caused
12	this scare was in 1953, correct?
13	A. Well, yes, the Mouse study was
14	reported on in 1954. There was a Hammond
15	and Horn report in '52 and then there were
16	earlier reports in the 40s and one even in
17	the late 30s, but the big ones, big
18	statistical reports come out in the 50s.
19	Q. The earlier ones were not
2	0	really in the news. The first one in the
21	news was reported in 1953 or 1954 that
22	really got the headlines.
23	A. Well, the Pearlman report or
24	the Raymond Pearl report in 1938 in
2	5	longevity was reported in die Times and
115
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	other newspapers and so was the Osher and
3	Debakey study.
4	Q. Is that when you think the
5	controversy in the public domain started,
6	1939?
7	A. As I said, the publicity given
3	these reports came largely in the mass
9	media in the early 1950s.
10	Q. When do you believe that the
11	controversy in the public domain, not
12	amongst doctors but among people in the
13	general public began?
14	MR. DAVIS: 1 object to the
15	form.
16	A. It would have begun sometime
17	in the 1950s, as there were stories that
18	some scientists debated the issue and as
19	the tobacco industry responded to the
20	scientific studies.
21	Q. In the early 1900s cigarettes
22	before, World War One, do you know how
23	popular smoking was in the United States?
24	A. Cigarettes were mass produced
25	in the 1890s and became more and more
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	popular because of that, and the increase
3	in smoking among men came with World Wa
4	One.
5	Q. And because of the, I think it
6	was the mass marketing of Camels in World
7	War One, diere was a rise in cigarette
8	smoking, or popularity really began like
9	1913, is that what you found?
10	A. Roughly so, yeah. Once we
11	entered the War in particular, because the
12	tobacco companies were providing free
13	cigarettes.
14	Q. So the early 1900s through
15	1950 do you know how cigarettes were being
16	advertised?
17	A. Not in any specific way.
18	There were ads obviously that appeared, but
19	they varied over that time period.
20	Q. Are you aware of ads that
21	would show people how to smoke and how to 2 2	inhale?
23	A. I have come across not
2	4	necessarily ads, but a few articles along
25	those lines, ves.
117
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Tell me about those articles.
3	A. I can only recall one that I
4	think came in 1939 in Life Magazine which
5	was then repeated in I think — I don't
6	know — 1960 something or even in the 1980s
7	I think it was repeated.
8	Q. Is that in your reliance
9	materials?
10	A. I think so.
11	Q. I never saw that. What does
12	it say in general?
13	A. The one in '39 wanted to
14	indicate to women how it would be more
15	ladylike to smoke.
16	It wasn't a very long article.
17	It showed — it was directed at club women,
18	how club women would smoke or should smoke
19	just physically, and then what Life Magazine 2 0	did to pick it up in one of their encore
21	issues I think in the 80s as a kind of a
22	joke to show how outdated the '39 article
23	was by the 1980s.
2 4	They did this with women's
2	5	fashions and thev did this with women's
--
118
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	handbags all from the 1930s, then repeated
3	in the 1980s.
4	Q. You came across ads where
5	tobacco companies were using doctors to
6	support the fact that smoking was safe and
7	not hazardous to your health?
8	A. 1 came across ads that said a
9	certain number of doctors or more doctors
10	smoked.
11	I don't think I came across an
12	ad where the doctors said they were safe.
13	Q. Ma'am, let me see if you can
14	answer this question with eitiier a yes, I
15	did or no, I did not. If you can't answer
16	it like that, then just tell me you can't,
17	fair enough? Because you may have answered
18	the same exact question in that fashion
19	before, so if you can’t answer that in that
2 0	fashion now I would like to know why, what
21	the problem is.
2 2	Maybe when you are in court you
2 3	think you have to answer questions, but when
2 4	you are in a deposition you think you are
2	5	entitled to ramble on, wliich I don't
119
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	appreciate, if that is the case. I am going
3	to ask you diis question, and if you can
4	answer yes, I did or no, I did not, I would
5	appreciate it. If you can’t tell me you
6	can't. Fair enough?
7	MR. DAVIS: I move to strike
8	the comments of counsel.
9	MR. PAIGE: I don't know what
10	move to strike means, but I don't
11	care. I am going to ask you the
12	question anyway.
13	Q. Did you come across ads where
14	the tobacco company was using doctors to
15	support die fact that cigarette smoking was
16	safe and not hazardous to your health?
17	A. No.	'
18	Q. Are you aware of tobacco
19	companies putting doctors in their ads to
20	tell die public, don't worry about what you
21	hear out there, our product is safe during
22	a particular period of time?
23	A. Up until 1956, they could use 2 4	doctors in their ads saying that so many
2	5	doctors preferred a particular brand.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	That's all I know about that.
3	Q- I want to know if you can
4	answer diis yes, tiiey did or no, they did
5	not, and if you can't tell me you can't.
6	MR. DAVIS: She did answer.
7	MR. PAIGE: No, she didn’t.
8	Q. You may have answered in that
9	way before, the one you just answered, no.
10	I will tell you you previously answered it
11	the opposite before. I am going to tell
12	you again — I don't care, I just want to
13	make my record clean.
14	I’m going to read this question
15	to you and see how you answer it.
16	MR. DAVIS: I move to strike
17	the comments of counsel.
18	Q. Would you like me to let you
19	know if you could answer the question diat 2 0	way before so you have an opportunity to be
21	consistent or do you want me to keep diat
2 2	from you?
23	A. Just ask the question again.
24	Q. Are you aware of a particular
2	5	period of time when tobacco companies used
121
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	doctors in their ads and they were putting
3	doctors in dieir ads to tell the public,
4	don't worry what you hear out there, our
5	product is safe?
6	MR. DAVIS: 1 object to form.
7	A. And my answer is that they
8	used doctors up until 1956.
9	Q. I want to know if you can
10	answer yes, they did or no, they did not.
11	I will tell you you answered in that
12	fashion before, so if you can't answer in
13	that fashion now I'm assuming you just
14	won’t do it because there is no judge here
15	to ask you to. In trial you did answer in
16	that fashion before, so I don’t know what
17	the problem is. 1 am troubled by it.
18	I am reading the question
19	verbatim. Let me see if you agree with this
20	or not.
21	When tobacco companies used 2 2	doctors in their ads they were putting
2 3	doctors in their ads to tell the public,
2 4	don’t worry about what you hear out tiiere,
2	5	our product is safe.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Would you agree for a
3	particular period of time yes, they did
4	that?
5	A. Yes, they did that with the
6	qualification I have mentioned.
7	Q. Did you also come across ads
8	that encouraged people and told people how
9	to smoke?
LO A. As I said, I came across an
L1	article that tried to show women how to
L 2	smoke in a more ladylike fashion. I don't
L 3	recall an ad that told them how to smoke.
L 4 Q. You don't remember an ad
L 5	explaining how you should inhale really
L 6	deep to get that smoke deep in there, get
L 7	that taste in there, you don't remember
L 8	that ad?
L 9 A. Not right now, I don't recall
10	that.
11	Q. Did you recall it a couple of
12	months ago when you were in trial for some
13	reason?
14	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
15	form of the question.
123
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I don't think so.
3	Q. You don't remember a Phillip
4	Morris ad where there is a lady smoking and
5	inhaling and she is talking about inhaling?
6	You don't remember that ad? It is a
7	Phillip Morris ad.
8	A. No, I don't.
9	Q. Would you agree that obviously
10	the tobacco companies were putting ads to
11	encourage people to smoke their product?
12	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
13	A. Of course.
14	Q. And in the 20s, 30s, 40s and
15	50 they were getting endorsements from
16	doctors and nurses?
L 7	A. Correct. I don't know if they
L 8	were getting them in the 20s and 30s. They
19	were getting them in the late 40s and 50s.
20	Q. And athletes?
21	A. Athletes Uiey were getting
22	earlier in the 30s.
23	Q. Athletes such as Babe Ruth,
2	4	Lou Gehrig, correct?
25	A. Yes.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. That would be similar to
3	Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal today,
4	correct?
5	A. Approximately, yes.
6	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
7	Q. There were movie stars in the
8	30s, 40s and 50s endorsing cigarettes,
9	correct?
10	A. Yes, that's generally correct.
11	Q. Movie stars such as — all the
12	top movie stars; John Wayne and Frank
13	Sinatra and Bing Crosby and Ronald Reagan
14	were shown prominently in cigarette ads
15	smoldng, correct?
16	A. Most of them were, yes.
17	Q. They also in the 30s — I
18	don't know about the 30s, but the 40s and
19	50s they would use past and future 2 0	presidents of the United States?
21	A. That I am not so sure of.
22	Q. Do you think as a historian
2 3	that advertisements or endorsements of
2 4	doctors and nurses and athletes and movie
2	5	stars could have a profound effect on a
125
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	child?
3	A. It could have an effect. I'm
4	not sure that it would be profound. It
5	depends on how much you drink children read
6	ads.
7	Q. Well, do you know what
8	percentage of TV shows were sponsored by
9	the cigarette companies in the 50s?
L 0 A. I don't know the percentage,
11	but I did extensive research in the TV and
12	Radio Museum in New York so I am familiar L 3	with those article programs in the 50s.
14	Q. Back in the 50s there was
L 5	two — I don't know -- one or two TV
16	channels, correct?
L7 A. Yes.
L 8 Q. And they were family shows
L 9	like Lucky Strike Hit Parade and families
2 0	would watch the shows together?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. It's different today where my 2 3	daughter will sit there and watch
2 4	Nickelodeon in one room and I will watch
2	5	the news in another, it wasn't like that
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	back then?
3	A. No. Just the three networks.
4	Q. A lot of the shows, a lot of
5	those family TV shows back in the 50s and
6	60s were sponsored by cigarette companies,
7	correct?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. When I say sponsored, they
10	would have an ad at the beginning and some
11	of them would have an infomercial in the
12	middle and an advertisement at the end,
13	correct?
14	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
15	form.
16	A. No, that is not quite correct.
17	Up until 1959 they didn't have the regular
18	30 second or minute ads. That came after
19	the networks took over those programs in
20	'59.
21	Up until that point the
22	sponsors, cigarette sponsors for those
23	programs would display the product anywhere
24	in the program itself.
25	Q. I didn't know that. Thank
127
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	you. Maybe that explains when I would see
3	the Lucky Strike Hit Parade it says this
4	show is sponsored by the Lucky Strikes,
5	then they would have pictures of the
6	cigarettes around their stage, then in the
7	middle of the show they would do what you
8	think would be an infomercial now, but it
9	was a couple minute thing where they talk
10	about how they made the cigarettes and how
L1	good the cigarette was, correct?
12	A. Exactly, up until'59.
13	Q. Up through '59 a lot of family
14	TV shows and children were watching shows
15	sponsored by cigarette companies where the L 6	cigarettes were displayed throughout the
17	entire show?
L 8	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
19 form.
2 0 A. Off and on, yes, that's true.
21	Q. After '59 there were still
2 2	family shows like the Beverly Hillbillies
23	and the Flinstones and the Dick Van Dyke
2 4	show and I Love Lucy that were sponsored by
2	5	cigarette companies, correct?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Within those shows you would
4	have Dick Van Dyke or you would have Jethro
5	from the Beverly Hillbillies or Fred
6	Flinstone would say this is great, this is
7	really good stuff to do?
8	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
9	A. More of that occurred up to
10	'59, some after '59. The ads themselves as
11	formal ads occurred after '59, even in
12	those programs that you’ve mentioned.
13	Q. But I have seen programs from
14	the Beverly Hillbillies, Dick Van Dyke and
15	the Flinstones which were after '59, and
16	what I'm saying is they would have a thing
17	where they said this show is brought to you
18	by Phillip Morris or Marlboro or Winston,
19	then they would show the actual star of the 2 0	thing saying hey, this is great, I like
21	this cigarette, this is a good cigarette.
2 2	Do you recall seeing that?
23	A. I recall some of that, but it
2	4	was more prevalent in the 50s than in the
25	60s.
129
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Do you remember seeing it in
3	die Beverly Hillbillies with Jethro and
4	Grandma smoking?
5	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
6	A. I don't recall that.
7	Q. What about Dick Van Dyke with
8	Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore smoking
9	and talking about cigarettes?
10	A. Yes, I recall that one.
11	Q. And that was in the 60s,
12	correct?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. And I Love Lucy, you remember
15	Lucy and Desi would smoke?
16	A. Yes, I remember them mainly
17	smoking in the 50s and talking about it,
18	yes.
19	Q. Where she says --1 don't
2 0	remember what she says — she gives a good
21	compliment to her husband because he is
22	smoking Phillip Morris though, right?
23	A. Yes.	~ ~
24	Q. You remember in the 60s Fred
2	5	and Barney smoking, correct?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. You would agree those types of
4	shows with those type of people smoking
5	could have an affect from a historical
6	point of view on young Americans?
7	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
8	form.
9	A. Yes, it could.
10	Q. Do you know if tiiose were
11	shows that Ellen Tate watched as a young L 2	girl?
13	A. I don’t know what she watched
14	as a young girl.
15	Q. You know she smoked Marlboros,
16	correct?
17	A. Yes. It was in one of the
18	depositions.
L 9 Q. And Parliaments?
2.0 A. Yes.
11	Q. And Merits?
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. And did you ever see the
14	Marlboro advertising campaign directed
15	towards women?
131
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Not that I specifically
3	remember.
4	Q. Do you remember advertising
5	campaigns where there would be young sexy
6	women smoking and they would say it was a
7	glamorous thing to do?
8	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
9	form.
10	A. Not specifically Marlboro ads
11	saying that, no.
12	Q. Do you recall ads in general
13	that were targeted to young women about
14	smoking in general?
15	A. I can remember ads from
16	probably all the cigarette companies where
17	young good looking women and men were used
18	in the ads.
19	Q. Not only used in the ads, but
20	would be portrayed as being sexy or
21	glamorous, have you seen those ads from the
22	50s or 60s?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. Have you seen the ads of Judy
2	5	London singing the Marlboro song?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. That is a sexy ad, would you
4	agree?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Could have an effect on a
7	young teenage girl or a girl in her 20s who
8	wants to look sexy?
9	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
10	A. It could.
11	Q. That is the brand that Ellen
12	Tate smoked as a young girl, correct?
13	A. Yes. ' “
14	Q. Parliament was actually, they
15	had a special filter that was supposed to
16	make the cigarette safer; is that correct?
17	A. I'm not sure. They may have.
18	I don't think she smoked Parliament for any
19	lengdi of time.
20	Q. Do you know if the filter
21	worked?
22	A. No.
23	Q. Do you know that's why she 2 4	switched, the filter wasn't working?
2	5	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
133
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. From the deposition I recall
3	she switched to Merits because either of
4	filter or lower tar and nicotine that she
5	thought was in them.
6	Q, It was marketed as being a
7	safer cigarette because of lower tar and
8	nicotine, correct?
9	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
10	form.
11	A. The Parliaments or Merit?
12	Q. The Merit
13	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
14	form of the question.
15	A. I think that was the case,
16	yes. She references the health question I
17	think in the deposition.
18	Q. Do you know that Merit is
19	actually not a safer cigarette?
20	A. I don't know, no.
21	Q. Do you know people who smoke
2 2	Merits still get severe end-stage emphysema
2 3	and die of lung cancer?
24	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
25	A. I don't know.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. That's what happened to
3	Mrs. Tate, she has end-stage emphysema even
4	though she smoked these supposedly safer
5	cigarettes, right?
6	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
7	form.
8	A. She has it. That's all I can
9	say.
10	Q. She smoked the safer
11	cigarettes and she still has end-stage
12	emphysema, right?
13	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
14	form.
15	A. Yes, she does.
16	Q. Do you know when she started
17	smoking as a 13-year-old girl in 1957, do
18	you know if it was known to her that she
19	would become addicted and one day be on
2 0	foil-time oxygen with end-stage emphysema? 21 MR. DAVIS: I object to the 2 2 form of the question.
2 3	I'm sorry, you said do you
2 4 know? Was that the beginning of tiiat 2 5 question? It sounded like a
135
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	statement.
3	MR. PAIGE: Did she know was
4	die question.
5	A. I don't know if she knew that.
6	Q, Do you think diere was a
7	reason why a little 13-year-old Ellen Tate
8	would know in 1957 that she would become
9	addicted to nicotine?
10	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
11	A. Only to the degree she would
12	have had health classes indicating the
13	dangers of addiction.
14	Q. You think back in 1957 people
15	knew about how addictive nicotine is like
16	they do now?
17	A. Not like they do now, no.
18	Q. Was the fact that people could
19	suffer the disease she has, emphysema —
2 0	she has been suffering for about 13 years
21	now, correct?
22	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
2	3 form.
24	A. I think so, 10 or 12
25	approximately, so yes.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Where she is now on oxygen
i	3	around the clock?
4	A. Yes.
5	Q. And do you think — tell me,
6	do you think she knew about that
7	possibility when she was 13 years old in
8	1957 that that could happen?
9	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
10	A. There is no way for me to know
11	about her knowledge or what was in her mind
12	as a 13-year-old any more than 1 can say
13	diat about anyone in 1957 or '59.
14	Q. When did the public start
15	knowing about smoking and emphysema, for
16	example, diat wasn’t until much later,
17	wasn't it?
18	A. Not much later, because
19	respiratory diseases associated witii the
2 0	lungs was reported on in Readers Digest and
21	the New York Times and other mass media
22	publications really from the 50s forward,
2	3	and lung diseases were reported on in the
24	30s and 40s.
25	Q. Have you seen where most
137
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	smokers -- have you learned from a
3	historical perspective at one point in life
4	most smokers begin to try to seriously
5	quit?
6	A. No.
7	Q. In the 1950s would you agree
8	more or less about half of all adults
9	smoked cigarettes?
10	A. I'm not sure that was true of
11	women in the 50s. I think it was true of
12	men.
13	Q. I think, as I was saying, all
14	adults, I think men was 60 percent, women
15	were lower, I believe Lacey, Florida said
16	half of all adults smoked cigarettes in the
17	50s.
18	A. Okay.
19	Q. Let me ask you the question.
20	If I say approximately, I don't want to
21	hold you to it. It might be 48 percent,
22	52 percent, I don't know the exact numbers.
23	If I knew I would tell you.
2	4	Would you agree in the 1950s,
25	do you agree approximately half of all
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	adults smoked cigarettes?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. You are aware of the frank
5	statement that was published in 1954,
6	correct?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. It stated that the tobacco
9	companies believed that the link between
10	smoking and cancer had not been proven,
11	correct?
12	A. Yes, that was a statement of
13	belief on their part in that statement.
14	Q. And they actually continue
15	with that statement or that stance that the
16	link between smoking and lung cancer had
17	not been proven for decades after that?
18	A. Yes. They kept saying even in
19	the frank statement that they did not
20	believe that there was a link, but they
11	thought more research needed to be done.
12	That was the standard approach they took.
13	Q. Now, you haven't seen their
14	independent internal documents about what
15	they really knew though?
139
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. No, I haven't.
3	Q. Did you see where their frank
4	statement also said there was no proof
5	linking cigarettes to lung cancer?
6	A. Yes. Both of those statements
7	were belief statements and then they went
8	on to say that they needed more research in
9	both cases.
10	Q. I am not asking about that. I
11	am asking about one statement now.
12	Are you familiar with the frank
13	statement from the cigarette companies to
14	the public that was published, I think that
15	43 million Americans that said there was no
16	proof that smoking caused lung cancer? Are
17	you aware of that statement in the frank
18	statement?
19	A. If you could read the exact
2 0	wording I would be well aware. I'm not
21	sure that was the exact wording.
22	Q. I don't have it memorized. Do
2	3	you have it in your reliance materials?
24	A. Yes, it is.
25	Q. Generally there was a
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	statement that says there is no proof that
3	smoking causes lung cancer?
4	MR. DAVIS: I am pulling it up
5	from a general source. Hold on.
6	MR. PAIGE: It is on the left
7	side somewhere. It is on the
8	left-hand side. It says there is no
9	proof.
10	Q. Do you see where it says no
11	proof?
12	A. Okay, yes.
13	Q. Ma'am, let me ask you a
14	question. There is a statement that says
15	they believe their products are not
16	injurious to health?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q, Is there a statement that says
19	no proof somewhere? I think it's on the 2 0	left, there's like four things they say.
21	A. No. We don’t see a proof
22	statement. We see the injurious one.
23	MR. DAVIS: I'm going to go up
2	4 here and pull up — I have a version
25	of it. Now I am looking at the actual
141
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	ad itself.
3	A. The ad was broken into two
4	columns, what we were looking at wasn't.
5	Q. I know it's on the left, and
6	then there is a thing where there's like
7	four parts, one, two, three, four?
8	A. Yes, we found it. Yes.
9	The distinguished authorities
10	point out, and then they go — it indicates
11	many possible causes, no agreement among
12	authorities, no proof that cigarette smoking
13	is one of the causes. Yes.
14	Q. So the frank statement --
15	frank means an honest statement, correct?
16	A. Yes. I found that out by
17	finding other frank statements for this
18	time period.
19	Q. The honest statement to their
2	0	consumers that was published, I believe
21	to — it was published in newspapers across
12	the country that 43 million Americans
23	subscribed to, correct?
24	A. My information is — granted
15	that's a large number, but my information
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	shows about 25 million. I don't know about
3	the 45 or 47 million.
4	Q. In addition to it being
5	published in papers where 25 million or
6	43 million Americans received, it was also
7	covered in the news and on certain TV
8	shows, correct?
9	A. I don't know about it being in
10	TV shows, but it was since it went to over
11	400 newspapers in about 250 cities, this ad
12	appeared in 448 newspapers.
13	Q. But additionally it was on TV,
14	it was covered in the news, they did a news
15	story on this, right?
16	A. Some of die newspapers I read
17	didn't cany the statement but commented on
18	the statement. Other newspapers carried
19	the statement then didn't comment on it.
2 0 Q. Aside from the newspapers, the
21	fact that the cigarette companies published
22	the frank statement diat was covered on TV,
2 3	on certain news stories on TV, right?
2 4 A. It might have been referenced,
2	5	but I don't think it was prominent coverage
143
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	of the statement itself.
3	Q. It was actually reprinted
4	several times after the initial print of
5	it, correct?
6	A. Not that I know of. I thought
7	it was a one-shot January 4th, 1954 ad.
8	Q. In any event, based upon what
9	you know, it was an honest statement that
10	went to newspapers and millions and
11	millions of Americans read it?
12	A. It was in the newspapers.
13	Whether millions read it I don’t know.
14	Q. Tell me what you think. Do
15	you think you learned this statement was
16	read by a lot of people or not?
17	A. Yes. It was a one page, one
18	day ad and diat's — obviously a number of
19	people read it.
2 0 Q. It says in there -- read into
21	die record what says about no proof. I
2 2	want to talk to you about that part now.
23	A. It is the third point that:
2 4	Distinguished authorities point
2	5	out — that is the top part — then number
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	three is there is no proof that cigarette
3	smoking is one of diese causes.
4	Q. The fact that they are telling
5	people that there is no proof that
6	cigarettes are a cause of lung cancer, that
7	was a lie, correct?
8	A. No. It is a statement of
9	belief, apparently on the part of the
10	companies signing this statement. It's
11	only a statement of their belief, diat's
12	all it is, and they then go on to say more
13	research is needed.
14	Q. But diey published that
15	statement because internally diey had a
16	meeting at the Plaza Hotel where they were
17	discussing the Winston and Graham studies
18	and got all the cigarette companies
19	together, hired a PR firm. They certainly 2 0	were aware of the medical research,
21	correct?
22	A. Yes. They indicate that in 2 3	the statement.
24	Q. So when they tell the public
2	5	diere is no proof that smoking causes lung
145
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	cancer, you think diat was a true
3	statement?
4	A. I think it was a statement of
5	their belief at the time with whether or
6	not diere's proof for it or against it.
7	They indicate that more
8	research is needed in diat statement in the
9	right-hand column.
10	Q. So you think that they really
11	believed there was no proof dien at that
12	time?
13	MR. DAVIS: I object to die
14	form.
15	A. I diink diat statement and the
16	injurious statements are simply statements
17	of dieir belief at that particular time,
18	and diey indicate diat more research is
19	needed.
20	Q. Ma'am, I understand. I don't
21	know why you want to keep throwing that in.
22	I want to know, do you believe — are you
23	telling me that you think diat they
2	4	believed in 1954 there was no proof?
25	MR. DAVIS: I object to the_
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	form.
3	A. I think that is a statement of
4	their belief at that time.
5	Q. When did the cigarette
6	companies first believe that cigarettes
7	caused lung cancer?
8	MR. DAVIS: 1 object to the
9	form of the question.
10	A. I really don't know. I don't
11	know.
12	Q. You told me for decades after
13	this they represented that they believed
14	the link between smoking and lung cancer
15	had not been proven. Do you remember we
16	spoke about that?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. And do you know, it wasn't
19	until 1999 or 2000 that they finally
2 0	admitted publically that smoking caused
21	lung cancer; is that correct?
22	A. Yes, I know that.
23	Q. It wasn't until after 2000
2 4	that they admitted publically that nicotine
2	5	was addictive, correct?
147
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I thought they did that in ’98
3	or '99, but perhaps it was slightly later.
4	Q. You know as late as '94
5	Phillip Morris swore they did not believe
6	that nicotine was addictive, correct?
7	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. You know that as late as 1994
10	Phillip Morris went before congress and
11	swore they did not believe it had been
12	proven that smoking causes lung cancer,
13	correct?
14	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
15	form of the question.
16	A. That was part of their
17	testimony, yes.
18	Q. And so is it your opinion that
19	Phillip Morris did not believe that smoking 2 0	caused lung cancer in the 1950s, 60s and
21	70s?
22	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
2	3 form of the question.
24	A. I have no way of knowing what
25	individuals within those -- within Phillip
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Morris knew or didn't know specifically
3	about lung cancer and its relation to
4	cigarette smoking, and the same is true in
5	1994.	"
6	Q. Well, you know they have
7	scientists and chemists working for them,
8	did you not know that?
9	A. Of course I knew that.
10	Q. And you know they are going to
11	read that they spent a lot of money
12	researching the product they make money off
13	of?	’
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. You would expect a company
16	like Phillip Morris in 1957 to know more
17	than little Ellen Tate, wouldn't you?
18	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
19	form of the question.
20	A. I can't say what Ellen Tate
21	knew in 1950 any more than I can say what
22	was inside the heads of representatives or
23	corporate executives for Phillip Morris
24	knew in 1954.
2	5	That is not the kind of
149
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	research I do, and I don’t know anyone who
3	could tell you what was inside the heads of
4	these executives or representatives of the
5	tobacco companies.
6	Q. But you read Ellen Tate’s
7	deposition; she swore to tell the truth
8	just like you did today, right?
9	A. Yes.
10	Q. She said in 1957 she didn't
11	believe it, right?
12	A. That’s what she said, yes.
13	Q. In 1957 Phillip Morris was
14	saying they didn't believe it either,
15	correct?
16	A. Yes, in their public
17	statements.
18	Q, So my question to you is just
19	as a historian or just as an educated
2	0	woman, do you think Ellen Tate, a little
21	13-year-old girl in 1957 knew more or as
22	much of the adverse health effects of
2	3	cigarettes than the people who were making
2	4	them at Phillip Morris?
2	5	MR. DAVIS: Obiection to form.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. There is no way I can answer
3	that. I know she was educated about the
4	health hazards of cigarettes by the time
5	she was 13.
6	Q. So she might have known more
7	than diem?
8	A. No, I don't think that's the
9	case either, but she would have been made
10	generally aware as a student of the health
11	hazards of smoking by that time.
12	Q. So Phillip Morris, if they
13	were smart, in 1957 they should have fired
14	all their people and hired the kids in
15	Ellen Tate's class to let them know what
16	their cigarettes were doing to people?
17	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
18	A. I'm not saying that at all.
19	Q. She is a 13-year-old girl in
20	Brooklyn, New York. There's doctors in
21	chemistry at Phillip Morris. You won't
2	2	even agree you think they knew more about
2	3	the adverse healdi effects than her?
24	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
25	A. Obviously they knew more in
151
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	detail, but if you are asking me what diey
3	exactly knew, I can't say.
4	Q. I didn't ask you diat.
5	A. Alright.
6	Q. I didn't ask you what exactly
7	they knew. I said who do you think knew
8	more about the adverse health effects of
9	smoking in the 1950s; Phillip Morris or
10	Ellen Tate?
11	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
12	A. Phillip Morris.
13	Q. What about in the 60s?
14	MR. DAVIS: Same objection.
15	A. Well, by the late 60s she is
16	indicating she knows about the hazards of
17	smoking.
18	Q. She is saying she is aware of,
19	not that she believes it.
2	0	What I want to know is who do
21	you think knew more about the adverse health
2	2	effects of cigarettes in the 60s; Ellen Tate
23	or Phillip Morris?
2	4	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
2	5 A. The answer would be the same.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	I guess, that scientists in general knew
3	more by that time.
4	Q. You are referring to the
5	scientists at Phillip Morris, I'm assuming?
6	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
7	A. No. I am referring to
8	scientists in general whose studies were
9	reported on.
10	Q. I'm talking about the
11	scientists at Phillip Morris. Who do you
12	think knew more about cigarettes in the
13	60s; Ellen Tate or Phillip Morris?
14	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
15	A. I haven't looked at the
16	scientists working for Phillip Morris in
17	that time period. I could say I assume
18	they knew more than she did, but that's all
19	I can say. I haven't seen their reports.
20	Q. You will agree with me it's a
21	pretty safe assumption to say Ellen Tate
2	2	who was now in her 20s — was she
2	3	college-educated?
2	4	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
25	A. No, she was not It is not
153
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	even clear from the deposition where or
3	when she received a high school degree.
4	Q. I was going to say I don't
5	know if she even finished high school,
6	right?
7	A. That's true.
8	Q. I mean, would you agree it
9	would be safe to assume the cigarette
10	company Phillip Morris knew more about the
11	health effects of their product in the 60s
12	than Ellen Tate?
13	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
14	form.
15	A. In a general sense, yes, that
16	you've stated, yes.
17	Q. The same with the 70s?
18	MR. DAVIS: Same objection.
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. And in the 60s and the 70s
21	Phillip Morris was saying that they didn't
2	2	believe that dieir cigarettes caused lung
2	3	cancer, correct?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And they were saying that they
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	were researching it, but if they found
3	anytiiing dangerous they would remove it,
4	correct?
5	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
6	A. Or they would report it is
7	what they usually said.
8	Q. There were statements on TV by
9	the heads of Phillip Morris if they found
10	anything dangerous in cigarettes they would
11	remove it, right?
12	A. There were some statements,
13	very few, by the head of Phillip Morris
14	himself, but tiiere were statements by
15	representatives of the tobacco industry
16	either from the TIRC or the TI.
17	Q. That they were researching the
18	product, correct?
19	A. Yes.
2	0 Q. And that if they located
21	anything that was dangerous or harmful they
2	2	would remove it, correct?
2	3 A. I am not sure they said that
2	4	all the time. They always said they were
2	5	researching it.
155
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. I'm not saying all the time.
3	They made some statements when they found
4	anything dangerous, if they did they would
5	remove it, correct?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. They also said they had these
8	fdters, so if there was anything dangerous
9	in the cigarettes it was making them more
10	safe, correct?
11	MR. DAVIS: I object form.
12	A. They said they had filters
13	that were removing the tar and nicotine.
14	Q. The implication was diat it
15	was making the smoking more safe?
16	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
17	A. I think the implication was
18	that, yes, until congressional hearings
19	were held in the federal -- the FTC said
2	0	that these filters weren't working.
21	Q. Actually, in 1957 what the FTC
2	2	said was you couldn't make those
23	advertising claims anymore, but that didn't
2	4	stop Phillip Morris from going on TV and
7 R	cnvmo 1+ in intpniimure (’nrrp/’t9
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. That's true.
3	Q. In fact, if Ellen Tate —
4	well, in fact, isn't it fair to say in the
5	50s and 60s there were millions of
6	Americans who believed and relied upon the
7	statements made by Phillip Morris in the
8	tobacco industry?
9	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
10	form of the question.
11	A. I don't know if they relied --
12	if they believed what they believed because
13	of Phillip Morris ads. I can't say that.
14	Q. Didn't you see in your
15	reliance materials articles in the New York
16	Times that talked about more people were
17	smoking and the effect that advertising was
18	having on smoking?
19	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
2	0 form of the question.
21	A. The increase in smoking that I
22	recall in the New York Times specifically
2	3	comes after a decline following the 1964
2	4	report. There was an increase later on in
9 R	flip* 1 Qfiflc whir'll yj/cic	nn
157
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Don't you remember reading
3	they were saying the dollars spent by the
4	tobacco companies on advertising is having
5	an effect on die rise in consumption of
6	cigarettes?
7	A. I don't recall that that was
8	specifically in these articles that I read
9	in the New York Times.
10	Q. Did you ever get that as a
11	general gist that that was happening?
12	A. I knew they were advertising,
13	but whether the increase in smoking was due
14	exclusively to the advertising I don't
15	think was made clear in the articles I
16	read.
17	Q. Why do you think they made the
18	cigarette companies take their ads off TV?
19	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
20	A. Well, I'm not sure how much
21	detail you want to go into about that.
22	Q. Actually, they passed the
23	Fairness Doctrine, correct?
24	A. That was in '69, yes.
7 R	M	Ann	if i rnn ot*Q rrrtin rr
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	to be advertising on TV we will put these
3	counter-ads on, correct?
4	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
5	A. Yes. The public service
6	announcements, yes.
7	Q. And the cigarette
8	advertisements outnumbered the PSAs by what
9	number, do you know?
10	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
11	A. I think it was about a
12	third — under the Fairness Doctrine, about
13	a third of the PSAs ended up about
14	33 percent They weren't balanced equally
15	with the ads.
16	Q. Was that five to one?
17	A. I thought it was three to one.
18	Q. Where did you hear it was
19	three to one?
2	0 A. In these documentaries that I
21	researched at the TV and Radio Museum here
22	in New York.
23	Q. Did you also hear that
2	4	although a lot of TV ads were running in
2	5	prime time some of the PSAs were running at
159
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	obscure times because it was cheaper?
3	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
4	A. I don't know if it was
5	cheaper, but it was commented that they
6	didn't always run in prime time.
7	Q. Because of the Fairness
8	Doctrine, the tobacco companies basically
9	said enough, we will pull our ads off TV?
10	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
11	A. I don't know if that was the
12	exclusive reason, but the documentaiy here
13	in New York indicated the PSAs were having
14	an impact, and that I think contributed to
15	the decision of the industry to pull its
16	ads.
17	Q. What documentary are you
18	referring to that you are relying upon?
19	A. If you do any research here at
20	the TV and Radio Museum on the subject of
21	tobacco or smoking, they bring up all kinds
22	of disks and videotapes that they have and
2	3	one of them in particular traces what we
2	4	talked about earlier, the placement product
2	5	for cigarette ads in these early television
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	programs, and it also goes into the impact
3	of the PSAs and follows them through the
4	Fairness Doctrine and the withdrawal of ads
5	from TV and radio in 1971.
6	It's a fairly comprehensive
7	documentary they pieced together. I think
8	they did it in the late 80s.
9	Q. Do you know the name of it?
10	A. Doesn’t have a name. Just
11	comes up under the generic term tobacco and
12	smoking.
13	Q, Where would I find it?
14	A. Right here in New York. I
15	think it's on maybe 57th and —
16	Q. What's the name of the place?
17	A. The Museum of TV and Radio.
18	Q. You would pull up tobacco and
19	health?
2	0 A. Tobacco and smoking, tobacco
21	and healdi, and they have an extensive
2	2	collection. They have ads, early ads of
23	the tobacco companies, and then they have
2	4	what they put together that is a
25	chronological documentaiy.
161
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. How many documentaries did you
3	review, just that one?
4	A. This is their major one at
5	this museum. They also had individual
6	documentaries on local television and radio
7	programs here in New York on the subject of
8	smoking where they opened the mics to the
9	public to call in.
10	It's very extensive and it's
11	veiy well put together, so you can get a
12	chronological sense of the progression of
13	the presentation of the hazards of cigarette
14	smoking to the people of New York.
15	They cover the smoke-outs in
16	New York and everything that's relevant to
17	increasing public awareness on the health
18	hazards of smoking and its addictive
19	qualities.
20	Q. When did you do that?
21	A. Oh, I did that -- let’s see —
22	back in 2005, 2006.
23	Q. Is that part of your research
2	4	for the Engle cases?
25	A. No.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Why did you do it?
3	A. It was before — let’s see. I
4	was doing it for another case that had
5	nothing to do with Engle.
6	Q. It's part of your general
7	research on tobacco in general?
8	A. Yes.	"
9	Q. Did you read all of their
L 0	materials or just selected materials?
LI A. I reviewed all that they had
L2	under those headings of tobacco, smoking
L3	and health concerns with cigarettes. I
L 4	think I saw everything they had.
L5 Q. How long did it take you?
L 6 A. Well, I would have to go back
L 7	to look at a particular invoice, but it
L 8	took me at least the better part of a week
L 9	I think to do it all, might have taken
10	slightly longer, but I was working here and
11	doing other things, so it took me at least
12	the better part of a week.
13	Q. Did you make copies of
14	anything from that?
15	A. I took notes on it from that
163
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	time period.
3	Q. Do you have your notes?
4	A. Not with me here, because it
5	was for an entirely different case.
6	Q. But you are telling me -- I am
7	asking about the Fairness Doctrine. You
8	know about it because of those notes, so —
9	A. I knew about it for other
10	reasons, but they happen to deal with the
11	Fairness Doctrine.
12	Q. You have reviewed a lot of
13	information on history, tobacco and health?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And your information is based
16	upon in part some of die readings you've
17	done in '94, some of the research you did
18	in 2005 and things you might have done
19	yesterday with McCall Magazine, right?
20	A. Yes. I did McCall’s earlier
21	too.
22	Q. I guess the point is -- can
2	3	you give me those notes? Could you provide
2	4	those notes from that research that you did
25	at the Institute or do you not have them?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I don't have them. They have
3	nothing to do with this case. I wouldn't
4	have considered diem for this case.
5	Q. I understand they have nothing
6	to do with the case — that you believe
7	they have nothing to do with the case. I
8	don't know if I agree with that because
9	there is information in there that may be
10	relevant to this case that you are going to
11	talk about from memory, and I would like to
12	see the notes, so I don't know if I agree
13	with that.
14	Do you have them anymore or do
15	you not have them?
16	A. I may have some of them back
17	in Montana.
18	Q. Are you going back to Montana
19	anytime soon?
20	A. Not until sometime next month.
21	Q. I'm so disorganized, I don't
22	remember what month it is anymore. You are
2	3	going to go back in June?
24	A. Yes. Maybe early June. Iam
2	5	not absolutely sure. It is an open-ended
165
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	trip I am on here.
3	Q. If I wanted to request them,
4	what would 1 ask you for, the notes from
5	your research regarding tobacco and health?
6	A. I think, just to be very
7	direct, simply the research that I would
8	have done at the TV and Radio Museum in New
9	York City, and these would have been
10	handwritten notes of mine that I did for
11	another case and may or may not have copy
12	for that particular case, if the case
13	didn't go to trial, which it didn't.
14	Q. If you don’t have them, that's
15	fine, I don't care, but if you have them I
16	would like to see them. If you have them
17	can you please not throw them away?
18	Because I am going to request them.
19	A. Right. I will do that. I
2	0	don't know if I have them any longer, but I
21	took handwritten notes at the time.
22	Q. If I wanted to go look at that
2	3	stuff or send somebody to look at it, is it
24	a lot of stuff to see if I wanted to see
2	5	what you saw?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. You could see it all. There's
3	no problem.
4	Q. Is there stuff in there about
5	the tobacco industry's conduct?
6	A. No. They do have early
7	tobacco ads that you could see under the
8	heading of simply, I think, tobacco ads,
9	and then they have this chronological
10	documentary that they put together, and
11	then they have the local coverage here in
12	New York of smoke-outs and programs on
13	television and radio.
14	At the time that I did it, I
15	think you either have to join or pay a fee
16	to see it, and I indicated to them that I
17	was a researcher, and anybody could go there
18	and say they wanted to do legitimate
19	research and you can get access to the
2	0	material. There's no restrictions on it.
21	Q. Can I ask to make a tape and
2	2	send it to me if I pay for it or —
23	A. I had to go look at it at that
2	4	time and it wasn't something I could just
2	5	order up or pay for.
167
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	They were indicating to me
3	there were funding problems in 2005 and
4	2006, that they weren't able to do it at
5	that time, and quite frankly, I preferred to
6	look at it myself to make sure I was calling
7	up everything I needed.
8	Q. What did they have on any of
9	the tobacco internal documents, anything
10	like that?
11	A. No.
12	Q. They didn't have anything
13	about the tobacco industry's conduct,
14	manipulating nicotine or marketing or --
15	A. Nothing like diat, no.
16	Q. But the documentary sounds
17	like I might find it interesting.
18	A. I think you would. I did.
19	MR. PAIGE: Do you want to
2	0 take a break now?
21	MR. DAVIS: Off the record.
2	2	(Discussion held off die record.)
23	(A lunch recess was taken.)
2	4 Q. We were talking about public
2	5	awareness before, and there's a lot of
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	information you went through, textbooks and
3	newspapers and magazines, that informed the
4	public about the health controversy in the
5	50s and 60s, correct?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. You are also aware of the fact
8	that there was awareness of the other side
9	of the issue, that there was awareness of
10	the fact that it had not been yet proven
11	and more research was needed diat was being
12	publicized on TV and newspapers and
13	magazines as well, correct?
14	A. Yes. We talked about that
15	earlier. Yes.
16	Q. I don't remember talking about
17	it earlier, but tiiere was a level of
18	awareness in the 50s and 60s, there was a
19	level of awareness regarding the issue of
2	0	smoking has not yet been proven to cause
21	lung cancer and diat more research is
22	needed, correct?
23	A. We talked about that in terms
2	4	of statements from the tobacco industry.
25	Yes.
169
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. I don't know that we talked
3	about that. I'm just asking you. I
4	wouldn't ask you that question if I
5	remembered that you answered it. I don't
6	have the record in front of me that I can
7	go back and see what you are referring to.
8	I would like an answer to my question, and
9	then we can move on.
10	A. Alright.
11	Q. So my question again is:
12	There was a level of awareness in die 50s
13	and 60s of the general public being aware
14	of the fact that there was this side of the
15	stoiy that smoking had not been proven to
16	cause lung cancer and more research was
17	needed on that issue, correct?
18	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
19	form of the question. You can answer.
20	A. Again, it's hard for me to say
21	yes to that because you are using the same
2	2	language you did earlier, and earlier I
2	3	also said diat that language was being used
24	by representatives of the tobacco company,
25	so to die degree that individuals or the
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	general public were aware of those
3	statements, the answer is yes.
4	Q. Well, but ma'am, it was the
5	tobacco industry’s research counsel that
6	was represented to be independent in die
7	frank statement who were making those
8	statements, correct?
9	A. Yes.
L0 Q. There were independent
L1	scientists who were maybe being paid by die
L2	tobacco industry that the public didn’t
L 3	know about diat were making those
L 4	statements in the popular press, correct?
L5	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
L 6 form.
L7 A. And there were scientists who
L 8	weren't being paid by the tobacco
L 9	industries that were contributing to that
10	debate in the 1950s.
21	Q. I don't know why we have to
12	have this debate if that's all true, so my
13	question to you, ma'am, is in the 50s and
14	60s there was a level of awareness in the
15	public also regarding die fact that it has
171
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	not been proven smoking causes lung cancer
3	and more research is needed, correct?
4	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
5	A. Yes, very generally speaking,
6	but not to make the awareness about the
7	health hazards and the awareness of what we
8	have been discussing here equal in any way,
9	shape or form. That's all I'm saying.
10	I am saying yes to your
11	question, but it was not an equal debate.
12	Q. I am asking you a question,
13	then I will ask you other questions.
14	Are you taking -- have you been
15	taking notes?
16	A. No, I haven’t been taking
17	notes. I just happened to pick up this
18	pen.
19	Q. Again, I will ask it again,
2	0	because for whatever reason you want to
21	answer questions I am not asking.
2	2	There was a level of awareness
23	in the 50s and 60s in the general public
2	4	that smoking may cause lung cancer, correct?
25	MR. DAVIS: 1 obiect to the
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	form. Asked and answered.
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. And there was also a level of
5	awareness in die general public in the 50s
6	and 60s of the fact or the issue that it
7	may not cause lung cancer, it hasn't been
8	proven to cause lung cancer and/or more
9	research was needed on that issue, correct?
10	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
11	form.
12	A. Yes.
13	Q. In terms of the awareness of
14	the issue, that it hadn't been proven, more
15	research was needed and things on that
16	line, some of that information was being
17	set forth or publicized, or most of it was
18	being set forth by the tobacco industry,
19	correct?
20	A. Yes.
21	Q. Either independently or
22	dirough the TIRC or other sources, correct?
23	A. Yes.
24	Q. The public didn't always know
25	that the sources that anoeared to be
173
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	independent were actually connected to the
3	tobacco industry though, correct?
4	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
5	A. I don't think that's true,
6	because that argument you're talking about
7	more research being needed and the studies
8	being inclusive usually in die mass media,
9	especially the print media.
10	That argument was usually
11	identified as coming from either the TIRC or
12	theTI.
13	Q. But the TIRC and the TI were
14	being represented as independent scientific
15	agencies, weren't they?
16	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
17	A. They were usually identified
18	as representing the tobacco industry.
19	Q. Did you read what they said in
20	the frank statement as to who die TIRC was?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Didn't it tell the public they
13	were an independent organization?
24	A. They said they were setting up
2	5	a scientific committee to conduct more
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	research.
3	Q. That would be an independent
4	scientific organization, correct?
5	A. Ostensibly, yes. It may be
6	implied it was independent. They simply
7	said they were setting up a scientific
8	research committee.
9	Q. In all the reading you have
10	done, you haven't seen anything that the
11	tobacco companies represented to the public
12	that the TIRC was an independent
13	organization?
14	A. Independent from the industry?
15	Q. Yes.	'
16	A. It had the name Tobacco
17	Industry Research Committee and it was
18	independent of the industry, how could that
19	be?	'
20	Q. Did you see the statements on
21	TV from the TIRC saying who they were?
22	A. Yes, and their name was
23	clearly stated on TV.
24	Q. So what do you think TIRC
2	5	stands for?
175
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Tobacco Institute Research
3	Committee.
4	Q. So I thought you said Tobacco
5	Industry Research Committee.
6	A. No.
7	Q. Tobacco Institute Research
8	Committee. You think the public was not
9	being told they were independent?
10	A. I don't think in any general
11	or any consistent way they were being told
12	they were independent.
13	Q. You were not aware of the fact
14	that was something that was being concealed
15	from the public?
16	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
17	form of the question.
18	A. What was being concealed was
19	the independence.
20	Q. That they weren't independent,
21	that they were being funded and told what
2	2	to do by the tobacco industry, you think
2	3	everybody knew that?
24	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
25	A. I think that it was clearly in
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	the articles I read. The print articles
3	especially usually identified a TIRC and TI
4	as representing the tobacco industry or
5	tobacco companies.
6	Q. Just so I'm clear, you have
7	not seen anything that would lead you to
8	believe they were independent or the public
9	would think they were independent in the
10	50s or 60s?
11	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
12	A. No.	~
13	Q. Did you see anything in the
14	internal documents where the tobacco
15	industry was bragging to each other, we are
16	representing to the public we are doing
17	this research independently when really we
18	are not or words to that effect?
19	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
20	A. No, I haven't seen those
21	documents.
22	Q. If I send those documents to
2	3	you along with the Gallop poll documents
2	4	would you be willing to review those before
2	5	your testimony at trial?
177
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I certainly wouldn't be
3	willing to review the internal documents,
4	no.
5	Q. So if I gave you internal
6	documents that contradicted what you were
7	saying, you would refuse to review those?
8	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
9	A. The internal documents can't
10	contradict what I'm saying about general
11	awareness because they weren't known to the
12	public. They didn't appear in the public
13	domain.
14	Q. The surgeon general reports in
15	1964 link cigarette smoking to cancer among
16	men, correct?
17	A. The '64 study reviewed
18	previous studies and most of those studies
19	were done on men, yes.
20	Q. One of the conclusions of the
21	'64 surgeon general report was also a link
2	2	that the surgeon general thought there was
23	a link between smoking and cancer in men?
2	4 A. Yes.
25	Q. When did it come out that_
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	there was a link between smoking and cancer
3	in women?
4	A. Subsequent reports emphasized
5	women more, but like most scientific
6	studies men are studied first and women
7	later.
8	Q. But they were seeing more lung
9	cancer in men than women and there was a LO	legitimate scientific concern that it
L1	really was affecting men for some
L 2	scientific reason and not women, correct?
L3	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
L4 A. No. I think it usually said
L 5	they hadn't done the studies on women, then
L 6	some of the newspaper articles predicted as
. 7	more and more women smoked, they
- 8	anticipated there would be more lung cancer
. 9	among women.
10	Q. Actually, didn't some of the
11	reports say they concluded that cigarettes
12	caused lung cancer in men and it was
13	possible that it may cause lung cancer in
14	women but they were unsure? You never saw !5	that?
179
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I saw that in the early 70s,
3	beginning in the 60s, yes, but it wasn't
4	something that they didn't think could
5	occur in women. I think they were
6	speculating it would as women smoked more
7	and more.
8	Q. When did the surgeon general
9	conclude that cigarette smoldng caused lung
10	cancer in women?
11	A. I don't know exactly when they L2	did.
L 3 Q. In all your research, do you
14	know when that began to be publicized?
15	A. The dangers for women were
16	publicized before the '64 report, and you
17	have found more and more articles as more
18	women smoked that they were at risk as well
19	as men.
20	Q. When did the studies and	1
21	articles start linking cigarette smoking to :
22	lung cancer in women?	i
23	A. I think you could find	:
2	4	articles beginning in the late 60s going ;
25	into the 70s. :
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. In terms of the '64 surgeon
3	general report, isn't it true that tobacco
4	companies came out and said despite the
5	report that publically came out and said
6	our product isn't bad for you, there's
7	really no evidence saying that, correct?
8	A. In some instances, yes. I
9	don't know if they said -- they very seldom
10	said our product isn't bad for you, but
11	they said more research is necessary and
12	the statistic are inconclusive.
13	Q. I'm going to read from the
14	prior testimony and see if you agree with
15	somebody who said this, who that person may
16	in fact be you. See if you agree with
17	yourself.
18	Usually when you testify you
19	understand when you swear to tell the truth
2	0	what that means?
21	A. Exactly.
22	Q, Do you agree with this
23	statement: There were stories following
24	the '64 surgeon general report where the
2	5	tobacco companies said our product isn't
181
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	bad for you, there's really no evidence
3	saying that. Doesn't that basically sum up
4	the substance of their comments that they
5	were making, correct?
6	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
7	form.
8	A. Are you quoting from testimony
9	I gave?
L 0 Q. Actually, I am, but I will
L1	reask it again. I will ask exactly how it
L 2	was asked of you. I have it cut and
L 3	pasted:
L 4	No matter what the surgeon
L 5	general says, the tobacco companies would
L 6	say our product isn't bad for you, there is
L 7	no evidence really saying that Isn't that
L 8	basically what the sum and substance of
L 9	their comments were?
20	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
11	form.
12	A. And my answer was?
13	Q. Well, I want to know what your
14	answer is today. I want to see if you
15	agree or disagree with yourself.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
3	Q. Your answer is what?
4	A. The answer was that they did
5	object to the report, whether they
6	generally said it was bad I think is not
7	die case.
8	They simply said more research
9	is needed and the statistics are
10	inconclusive. I may simply have allowed
11	diat overgeneralization to go through in
12	diat particular part of my testimony.
13	Q. So that wasn't true when you
14	testified to it?
15	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
16	form.
17	It's not fair for her to
18	comment on something when she hasn't
19	seen the entirety of her testimony.
20	You can ask the question the
21	way you want to, but you are asking
2	2	her to comment on testimony —
2	3	MR. PAIGE: I will rephrase
24	the question. If that is your
25	objection --
183
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Would that be untrue if
3	somebody testified to that?
4	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
5	form.
6	A. If someone testified to that,
7	they said —
8	Q. If somebody was asked no
9	matter what the surgeon general says, our
10	product isn't bad for you, there's no
11	evidence really saying that. Isn't that
12	basically what the sum and substance of
13	their comments were.
14	And if the person answered:
15	When those comments appeared in the story
16	about die study, yes, that's what they said.
17	Would that be a truthful or
18	untruthful answer to that question?
19	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
2	0	Compound question. I think it is
21	impossible to answer.
22	A. I can only say it would be
2	3	generally true with the qualifications I
2	4	have stated here.
25	Q. Generally true, then tell me
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	the qualifications.
3	A. The terminology generally good
4	for you or not generally bad for you were
5	not the terms used in the tobacco
6	industry's response to the '64 report.
7	Q. What were die terms used to
8	convey die message that smoking is not
9	really bad for you after the '64 surgeon
10	general report by the tobacco industiy?
11	A. The common statements were
12	that more research needed to be done and
13	that there was no conclusive proof of the
14	linkage between lung cancer and smoking.
15	Q. Asa historian, can you see
16	what type of effect diose assurances would
17	have on addicted smokers?
18	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
19	form.
20	A. 1 really can't answer that
21	question in any specific way.
22	Q. What about in a general way?
23	A. No. It depends again on how
2	4	many of tiiose kinds of statements would
2	5	have appeared in the response. I am
185
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	assuming we are still referring to the '64
3	report and whetiier or not an addicted
4	smoker would have looked more carefully at
5	those statements than at the headlines and
6	the opening paragraphs of these stories
7	about the '64 report.
8	Q. Well, some of those statements
9	were actually in the headlines by the
10	tobacco companies, correct?
11	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
12	A. As I said earlier, very few of
13	these headlines referenced die tobacco
14	companies in the headlines.
15	For that '64 report, by and
16	large, all of the headlines talked about the
17	health hazards of smoking and the report,
18	then in the story you might find these
19	statements we have been talking about with
2	0	respect to die tobacco companies.
21	Q. Ma'am, some of those stories
2	2	and headlines were about the tobacco
2	3	industry's position that smoking was not
24	harmful, correct?
25	A. Some of them were, yes.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. That would be not only
3	following the 1964 report but also
4	following the '69 report, correct?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. They were covered in the New
7	York Times, correct?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. As well as the Miami Herald,
i	0	correct?
LI A. Yes.
L2 Q. In the 70s, the tobacco
L 3	companies were still telling the public
L 4	that they didn’t believe that cigarettes
L 5	were harmful and that if there was any
L 6	dangerous ingredient identified it would be
L 7	removed, correct?
L8 A. Yes. Generally speaking, yes.
19	Q. And that went on throughout
10	the 70s and into the 80s, correct?
21	A. Yes, with less frequency but
12	it did go on.
23	Q. When the cigarette companies
14	were telling the public that they believed
15	that to be true, were they lying?
187
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I don't know. I have no way
3	of knowing what they were individually
4	thinking.
5	Q. Come on. You have been doing
6	this 20 years. You don't know now,
7	seriously, that they were lying when they
8	were doing that in the 70s and 80s? You
9	know that.
10	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
11	form.
12	A. You are asking me if I know
13	that an individual representative of the
14	tobacco industry or an executive of the
15	tobacco industry was lying, and I can't say
16	they were intentionally lying.
17	I can't get inside their heads
18	and neither can you.
19	Q. I can because I took the time
20	to read their documents. You have
21	neglected to do that, right?
22	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
2	3 Argumentative.
2	4 A. It's not a part of my
2	5	research. It has nothing to do with
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	general awareness.
3	Q. You read the summaries on
4	Cigarette Century and Cigarette Papers and
5	Ashes to Ashes, you know they were lying in
6	the 70s and 80s, don't you?
7	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
8	form of the question.
9	A. I can’t testify whether it is
10	the tobacco industry or another company
11	or — I really can't testify about any
12	individual lying.
13	I don't know how to determine
14	that that individual was lying, and I don't
15	think most psychiatrists can determine it,
16	as far as that goes.
17	Q. So in Florida where there is a
18	finding that they lied, do you think the
19	Supreme Court of Florida just got it wrong?
20	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
21	form of the question.
22	A. That is beyond my expertise.
23	I don't know about whether they got it
2	4	wrong or whether they got it right.
25	Q. But in the summaries that you
189
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	read, you read that some of the people were
3	lying. Didn't you get the gist of that?
4	I will read the summaries you
5	read, so I just want to know that you are
6	under oath today, did the summaries -- did
7	you glean from those summaries that some of
8	these people from Phillip Morris and the
9	tobacco industry were lying in the 70s and
10	80s or you did not see that?
11	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
12	form of the question.
13	A. I read the reviews of the
14	books, and in some instances, depending on
15	the point of view of the author, they may
16	have said the tobacco companies were lying
17	because that was their opinion, and in some
18	other instances they may have not come out
19	with that direct statement about the lying.
20	It depended on the author.
21	Some authors are more careful about making
22	those statements than others.
23	Q. But the books you read, it was
2	4	like four books?
2	5 A. No. I have partially read one
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	book. The other books I read reviews of.
3	Q. The books you read reviews of,
4	you told me the books. Were there other
5	books you didn't tell me about?
6	A. You asked me about books
7	following the 1994 hearings and those are
8	the ones I sited. I read other books prior
9	to that.
L0 Q. Which books are you talking
L1	about now?
12	A. I read historical studies
L 3	going back to the 70s that were simply
L 4	traditional historical studies of the
L 5	tobacco industry.
L 6 Q. Where did you read those?
L7 A. I read those when I was in
L8	Indiana when I first started the research.
L 9 Q. Can you tell me — can you
20	describe what you are talking about?	:
21	Because I am not familiar with that.	'
22	A. With what, the books?	i
23	Q. With what you read when you	.
24	were first hired. What are you talking	i
2	5	about? 1
191
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I went back and read, as I
3	would with any historical research product,
4	the secondary literature on the topic so
5	you are not reinventing the wheel when you
6	start to do your own primary research.
7	Q. That was in 1994?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. What was it that you read in
L 0	1994 that you remember talking about?
LI A. I went back and read as most
L2	people do, they start with the Susan Wagner '
L 3	book and go forward from there, and her '
L 4	book came out in 1971.	!
L 5 Q. What is her book?
L 6 A. Her book I think is simply
L7	called — maybe it's Cigarette Country. I
L 8	don't know exactly the title, but simply a :
1.9	generic title about the tobacco industry.
20	Q. I have never heard of that	1
11	book.	\
22	What books did you read after
13	that? When you said you went from there, !
2	4	what else?	!
25	A. Well, I could give you a	1
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	fairly extensive list. I went then to
3	read — since I was doing a cultural
4	awareness style of study, I wanted to make
5	sure that I was looking at —
6	Q. Ma'am, just tell me the books.
7	All I want to know is the names of the
8	books.
9	A. I selected them on the basis
10	of looking at popular culture.
11	Q. That's fine.
12	A. I would have started with
13	Michael Schudson book on Easy Persuasion,
14	in which he argues very convincingly that
15	you have to have a major cultural change in
16	society before there are changes in
17	consumer buying habits, and he also pointed
18	out that advertising to women, the ads
19	specifically targeting women did not occur 2 0	until after they had started smoking in the
21	1920s for cultural reasons.
22	Q. You don't have to explain the 2 3	books. Just the names of the books. I
2 4	might have questions about specific books,
2 5	but just tell me the titles. You said
193
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	there was an extensive list.
3	A. I read John Burman's book on
4	Bad Habits, I read David Cartwright's book
5	on Force of Habits — Forces of Habit. I
6	read Cassandra's taped book on cigarettes,
7	Little White Slaver, and several other
8	books.
9	Q. Do you know the names of the
10	several other books? You said it was a
11	fairly extensive list. You gave me four or
12	five books.
13	A. I read one by a fellow named
14	Slovic who did public policy on smoking, I
15	read one by Justin Marmus on Risk Taking
16	and Smoking.
17	That's not the complete list,
18	but it is the ones I can recall right now.
19	Q. This was all before '94 that 2 0	you read all these books?
21	A. I started to read them in '94
22	to familiarize myself with what information 2 3	was out there and available.
24 Q. But a lot of these books don't
2 5	have to do with public awareness and public
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	knowledge, why are you reading them?
3	A. The later ones have to do with
4	culture and changes in the culture which
5	does effect general awareness.
6	The Cartwright and Burman books
7	were very — I thought — informative from
8	my point of view.
9	Q. What books? Did you tell me LO	those already?
LI A. Yes.
L2 Q. When did you last read one of
L 3	these books?
L 4 A. I read most of them —
L 5	fianldy, assuming that all of them were
L 6	published, not all of them were published
L7	by '94, but I think most of them by '95.
L 8 Q. Is that books you read on your
L 9	own or were you asked to read them by the
10	tobacco companies?
11	A. On my own, my independent
12	research. It is the way you start any
13	project, you read the literature.
M Q. Did any of those books talk
15	about the conduct of the industry?
195
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I think Susan Wagner's book,
3	which is the starting point for most of
4	this, didn't talk about the conduct of the
5	industry because she didn't have access to
6	any internal documents, but she talked
7	about it as an industry.
8	I am giving figures of — some
9	figures on the production of cigarettes
10	beginning in the 1890s, and then the number
11	of companies involved in the business, just
12	general kinds of information about the
13	industry.
14	Q. But did any of the books you
15	ever read, did you ever hear about what
16	they did, the tobacco companies?
17	A. Only the ones that we talked
18	about earlier that I read reviews of that
19	appeared after 1994.
2	0	The books I was reading we are
21	talking about now appeared before 1994.
22	Q. Did you read these books
13	differently than you read the later books
2	A	or you would read the reports and 5 or
25	10 percent of the book?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A, I read the books we are
3	discussing now that I started to
4	familiarize myself with the literature, I
5	read most of those more carefully,
6	especially the ones that dealt with
7	culture, then I read the ones dealing after
8	1994 with the internal documents because my
9	standard of research focuses on general
10	awareness and what was available to the
11	public.
12	Q. Do you consider Slovic to be
13	an authoritative source on this topic?
14	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
15	form of the question.
16	A. From a historian's point of
17	view, there are very few authoritative
18	sources, because individuals can disagree
19	to a logical extent on interpretation.
2	0	Slovic simply happens to have
21	done public policy and other things.
22	I think his book is an edited
2	3	collection, so he is not authoritative in
2	4	the sense that he is simply editing other
2	5	people's essays.
197
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. What was Little White Flavor
3	about?
4	A. The Sandra Tate book?
5	Q. Yes.
6	A. It was again quite a small
7	book that just did a general survey, first
8	of the industry, then had some information,
9	for example on the frank statement and the
10	fact that it appeared and the industry's
11	response to scientific studies, but keep in
12	mind it is a very, very small book where
13	she just surveys a lot of information.
14	It is not the most
15	well-researched book as I would think some
16	of the others are.
17	Q. How did she conduct her
18	research?
19	A. Well, it depends on what kind
20	of book you want to write, whether you want
21	to write a book that is heavily footnoted
22	with all kinds of primary documentation or
2	3	whether you want to write a summary, and
2	4	she basically wrote a summary.
2	5	For examnle. she has some
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	interesting information on the states which,
3	for example, ban the sale of cigarettes at
4	the turn of the last century, but none of it
5	is in depth. It is not a book that would be
6	considered terribly profound or detailed.
7	Q. That doesn't mean she didn't
8	do research.
9	A. You do write books that are
LO	summaries and easily readable without doing
L1	all the research that you would do if you
L 2	were going to write a book diat was
L 3	detailed in every aspect of your subject.
L 4	She just simply wasn't going to do that.
L 5	I am not saying she didn't do
L 6	any research, she just didn't do detailed
L7	research.
L 8 Q. Not as detailed as Ashes to
L 9	Ashes, for example?
20	A. Exactly.
21	Q. Did you learn about some of
22	the tobacco documents when you read Ashes 2 3	to Ashes?
2	4 A. The documents were in there,
25	but as I said, I wasn't reading the book
199
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	because diat type of information didn't
3	reflect general awareness.
4	Q. Ma'am, I didn't ask you why
5	you read the book. I am just asking when
6	you read the book.
7	For whatever reason you read
8	the book, I really quite frankly
9	respectively don't care. I am not asking
LO	why you read the book. My question is when
L1	you read the book did you learn about any of
L2	the tobacco documents?
L 3 A. I saw some of them, yes, and
L 4	as I said before, I read less than
L 5	10 percent of that book. We have gone over
L 6	this.
L7 Q. That's what that book is
L 8	about. Isn't it about the tobacco
L 9	documents?
20	A. In part it's about die tobacco
21	documents. It is about a lot of odier	i
22	tilings as well.	! 33 Q. It was a well-received book ;
2	4	that won die Pulitzer Prize, didn't it? ! 25 A. Yes. :
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Do you consider it to be
3	authoritative?
4	A. Again, that term is not used
5	by historians. It is not an authoritative
6	book.
7	There are other books that are
8	equally informative. I couldn't mention to
9	you a book that is authoritative on the
10	Civil War, for example. That simply isn't
11	part and parcel of historical research.
12	We don't run around looking for
13	a single book that says eveiything about a
14	subject.
15	Q. I am not trying to make you
16	angry here.
17	A. You are, because you are not
18	respecting what historians do.
19	Q. I respect what a lot of
20	historians do. I know a lot of historians
21	who I respect.
22	I am asking you this book,
2 3	however you read it, for whatever reason you
2 4	read it that won a Pulitzer Prize and was
2	5	well researched, do you consider diat to be
201
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	a leading reliable source?
3	A. It is a major source on the
4	subject and it is fairly reliable, but it
5	is not audioritative. That is how we
6	started this.
7	Q. You can't tell me anything
8	that's authoritative on this topic, can
9	you?
10	A. No.
11	Q. But this is a major reliable
12	source?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. That's about as close as we
15	can get to authoritative in your opinion,
16	correct?
17	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
18	A. In your opinion.
19	Q. Well, can you tell me a book
2 0	that's — another term that you would use
21	to describe sometiiing that's closer to
2 2	authoritative than major reliable source
2 3	that won a Pulitzer Prize?
24	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
25	form of the question.	_
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I could if we would go on to a
3	particular topic.
4	Q. On this topic, on the topic of
5	cigarettes and health for which we are here
6	today.
7	A. Another book that's as
8	reliable as the Kluger book?
9	Q. No. You told me it is not L 0	authoritative, correct?
LI	A. Right.
L2	Q. You said you don't know of
L 3	anything that's authoritative on die topics
L 4	for which we are here today, correct?
L 5	A. That's true.
L 6	Q. But you said this book that
L 7	won a Pulitzer Prize is a major leading
L 8	reliable source, correct?
L 9	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
10	form. Mischaracterizes.
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. I want to know is that as
13	close to a reliable source as you are
14	willing to go on this subject matter for
15	any source?
203
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
3	form.
4	A. I guess that's true. For
5	historians, authoritative means there is a
6	single source, and no book on this subject
7	is the single authoritative source. That's
8	all I am saying, regardless of the Pulitzer
9	Prize or how reliable is it, it is not
10	necessarily the single book. It is not the
11	bible on tobacco.
12	Q. No tiling is?
13	A. Nothing is.
14	Q. This is as close as we will
15	get?
16	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
17	A. Not in my opinion.
18	Q. So tell me something closer
19	then. Is there something closer to the 2 0	bible? I want to know what it is.
21	A. I don't think there is.
22	Q. Okay. That's my point. Thank
2	3	you.
24	In terms of your — I'm reading
25	another question and answer. Let me see if
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	I can get it correctly.
3	Would it be fair to say that as
4	the medical literature became more and more
5	widely put that cigarette smoking was bad
6	for your health the tobacco companies took
7	an even more aggressive approach denying
8	that cigarette smoking was bad for your
9	health, isn't that true, ma'am?
10	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
11	A. They became — they reacted
12	each time a report came out and I think ~
13	Q. They became what?
14	A. They reacted each time a
15	report came out, so their pattern of
16	activity was that we're simply waiting for
17	or responding to the next report, so as
18	more and more reports came out you would
19	see them reacting to each report 2 0	individually.
21	Q. They took a consistent
22	approach that was going to deny the 2 3	evidence that was coming out of the
2	4	scientific studies, correct?
25 A. Yes. Each time they reacted
205
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	to the scientific studies.
3	Q. For example, when the American
4	Cancer Society came out and said if you
5	smoke you are gambling with your life, they
6	continued to take the position that
7	cigarette smoking was not bad for your
8	health, correct?
9	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
10	A. They continued to react to any
11	of the health organizations or the surgeon
12	general's reports in the same manner, yes.
13	Q. By saying it hadn't been
14	proven or more research was needed or we
15	will remove the dangerous ingredient,
16	correct?
17	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. They continued to encourage
20	people to start smoking and continue
21	smoking their product, correct?
22	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
23	A. Their ads were to sell a
24	product. Yes.
25	Q. Ma'am, you answered this with
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	a yes or no before. I want to see if you
3	can answer it yes or no.
4	A. I thought I just did.
5	Q. But then you added something.
6	I don't know what it meant.
7	As the studies were coming out
8	from the American Cancer Society and the
9	surgeon general's report, the tobacco
10	companies and Phillip Morris continued to
11	encourage people to start smoking and
12	continue smoking their product correct?
13	A. Yes.
14	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
15	Q. Can you tell us when the
16	tobacco companies ~ I think we did this —
17	when they acknowledged it was addictive? I
18	think you said '88 or '89, correct?
19	A. No. '98 or'99.
20	Q. Oh, I'm sorry. I might have
21	asked you about filters, if you can bare
22	with me it would be helpful.
2 3	The filters were being
2	4	advertised as a safer cigarette since the
25	50s?
207
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Filters came in toward the end
3	of that decade, and the idea was, I guess,
4	that they filtered out harmful ingredients.
5	Q. But they were being advertised
6	in the 50s and 60s as a safer cigarette,
7	correct?
8	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
9	A. I don't think the ads said
10	they were safer. They simply said the
11	filters were either making the cigarette
12	more mild or was filtering out say nicotine
13	and tar.
14	Q. The nicotine and tar is what
15	people thought was causing the problem,
16	right?
17	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
18	A. Yes. On the other hand, you
19	are saying they were saying in the ads that 2 0	this made it then safer,
21	They did not say it was safer.
2 2	They simply said this filter will make it
2 3	smoother or more mild or will take out
2	4	nicotine and tar.
25_They didn't then come up with a
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	statement following that that it was a safer
3	cigarette.
4	Q. But in the 50 and 60s people
5	thought that it was nicotine and tar that
6	was causing this potential problem,
7	correct?
8	A. For the end of the 50s that
9	came up, yes.
10	Q. And in the 50s and 60s the
11	cigarettes were advertising their product
12	and saying that the filters were removing
13	or filtering out some of die harmful tars
14	and nicotines, correct?
15	A. Filtering out the tars and
16	nicotines. Whether or not the term harmful
17	was used I'm not so sure.
18	Q. But the implication was that
19	the tar and nicotines were harmful and they 2 0	were being filtered out, correct?
21	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
2 2 form of the question.
23	A. Presumably so, but again, it
24	is an ad and I can’t really comment on what
2	5	the ad really meant.
209
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Ma'am, I am not asking you as
3	an advertising expert.
4	You know the public was aware
5	that it might be the tars and nicotines that
6	were causing this potential problem in the
7	50s and 60s, right?
8	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
9	form.
10	A. Up to a point, because the FTC
11	interceded and said the companies could not
12	continue to indicate the tar and nicotine
13	levels of their cigarettes.
14	Q. My question was about what the
15	public was aware of. I am asking in the
16	50s and 60s, the public believed or the
17	public awareness was the tar and nicotine
18	in the cigarettes is what the scientists
19	thought might be causing the epidemic of 2 0	lung cancer, correct?
21	A. Generally, yes.
22	Q. The cigarette companies were 2 3	stating to the public that the filters were
2 4	removing tars and nicotine which presumably
2	5	were harmful, correct?_
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
3	form.
4	A. Yes, and they were showing
5	percentages, but again, I'm not sure what
6	it all meant.
7	Q. I am not asking what it meant.
8	Have you seen the polls in the
9	1950s and as late as 1970 where 58 percent
10	of smokers thought filters reduced the
11	adverse health effects of smoking?
12	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
13	A. No, I haven’t seen that poll.
14	Q. You are talking about public
15	awareness and public beliefs. Do you know
16	if the public was aware or the public
17	believed — strike that.
18	Do you know as late as 1970
19	that 58 percent of smokers believed that 2 0	using filters reduced the adverse health
21	effects of smoking?
22	MR. DAVIS: I object to the 2 3	form of the question.
2	4	A. Unless that poll was published
25	in the mass media or commented on on
211
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	television, no, I don't.
3	Q. In the newspaper articles that
4	you read or whatever you looked at did you
5	learn there was an awareness in the public
6	amongst smokers, they thought the filters
7	reduced the adverse health effects of
8	smoldng?
9	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
10	A. Generally speaking, no. You
11	are siting a poll that was not sited in the
12	articles and the mass media that I looked
13	at.
14	Q. I am not asking about polls.
15	I have seen newspaper articles, articles in
16	the New York Times, where they talk about
17	filters in the 60s and 70s. You haven't
18	seen any of those articles?
19	A. I have seen those articles.
2 0	They are usually talking about
21	congressional hearings indicating that the
22	filters were not effective.
23	Q. Have you seen anything in
2 4	articles that talk about — that you have
2	5	listed on your reliance materials in the
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	New York Times — that talked about the
3	cigarette companies representing to the
4	public that the filters were making
5	cigarettes safer? Have you seen that?
6	A. Probably in a very general
7	sense, yes.
8	Q. Have you seen Howard Coleman
9	on behalf of Phillip Morris following the
10	surgeon general report telling the public
11	in the news program that the filters were
12	removing anything dangerous that may exist?
13	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
14	A. Yes, I have seen that.
15	Q. So that was information that
16	the public was aware of, correct?
17	A. In that single interview, yes.
18	Q. Also in the newspaper articles
19	they were aware of the fact that the
2 0	cigarette companies were representing that
21	the filters were removing dangerous tars
2 2	and nicotines, correct?
23	A. They reported that that was
2	4	supposed to be the function of the filter,
25	but normally these articles also indicated
213
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	that the filters were ultimately determined
3	to be ineffective.
4	Q. You haven't studied about what
5	effect the representations of the cigarette
6	manufacturers on the health effects of the
7	filters played in the public mind?
8	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
9	A. No.
10	Q. You agree that -- have you
11	looked at smokers wanting to quit?
12	A. Well, I have looked at
13	articles that helped them to try to quit.
14	I have seen figures showing how half of all
15	smokers have quit.
16	Q. What do you mean by half of
17	all -- what have you looked at that said
18	half of all smokers have quit?
19	A. You find that in information
2 0	from die American Cancer Society, you find
21	it in information from most health groups
22	where they are trying to encourage people
23	to smoke, indicating to them that many 2 4	smokers can quit and have quit, and it
2	5	usually ends up about half of all smokers
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	end up quitting, and it is an encouragement
3	from health organizations to tell people
4	this.
5	Q. Do you consider the American
6	Cancer Society to be authoritative?
7	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
8	form of the question.
9	Authoritative in what sense?
10	THE WITNESS: Right.
11	Q. On smoking and cancer.
12	A. I think it is a major source
13	for scientific information on smoking and
14	cancer. I think that goes without saying.
15	Why would you have an American Cancer
16	Society that didn’t do that?
17	Q. What information have you read
18	from the American Cancer Society? That's
19	what I need to know.
20	A. I'm primarily familiar with
21	their posters that diey began to put out in
22	the 60s and also the pamphlets that they 2 3	distributed across the country, the
2 4	millions of volunteers they organized to
2	5	conduct both antismoking clinics, and
215
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	simply to generally convey information,
3	especially educational information to
4	schools.
5	So I am familiar with dieir
6	outreach activities on this subject. Of
7	course they were basing their information
8	and all of this material on scientific
9	studies, some of which they conducted
10	themselves and some that were conducted by
11	the government.
12	Q. The 50 percent number you are
13	talking about, did you read that on the
14	net, in a book? Where did you find that?
15	A. I would have read it in some
16	of the reports, some of the stories where
17	they were quoting the American Cancer
18	Society. I think primarily that's where it
19	came from.
20	Q. Do you understand nicotine is
21	addictive?
22	A. I do, yes.
:2 3 Q. And do you know as a historian
24	it’s been reported in the popular press to
25	be as addictive as cocaine and heroin?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	MR. DAVIS: I object.
3	Objection to form.
4	A. As of the surgeon general
5	report that said that, yes. That's quite
6	late.
7	Q. The surgeon general in 1988,
8	they determined nicotine is highly
9	addictive, correct?
10	A. That was the report, yes, the
11	1988 report.
12	Q. It was covered in your
13	reliance materials?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. It is in your reliance
16	materials that it's been determined to be
17	as addictive as cocaine and heroin,
18	correct?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. You also are aware are you
21	not -- did you know that 90 percent of 2 2	smokers are deemed to be addicted to 2 3	nicotine?
2	4 A. No.
25	Q. Do you know what percentage of
217
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	smokers are addicted to nicotine?
3	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
4	form.
5	A. No, I don't.
6	Q. Are you aware or did you read
7	a large proportion of smokers have
8	indicated a desire not to smoke or wish
9	they were not smokers at all?
10	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
11	A. I'm generally aware of that.
12	I don't know the figures on it.
13	Q. You are also aware of die fact
14	that when the American Cancer Society, whei
15	they said 50 percent of smokers quit that
16	takes into account people who may have been
17	light smokers? Strike that.
18	Do you know some people are
19	heavily addicted, some people are moderately 2 0	addicted and some people are not addicted at
21	all?
22	A. Yes. There are social smokers
2 3	and there are smokers smoking two or three
2 4	packs a day. Yes, there's a difference
2	5	there._
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. There are smokers that smoke a
3	pack a day, there are people who smoke two
4	cigarettes a day that may not be addicted,
5	correct?
6	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
7	form.
8	A. I think so, yes.
9	Q. Do you know that in terms of
L 0	the 50 percent who used to smoke, do you
L1	know if that takes into account people who
L2	are not addicted?
L 3	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
L 4 A. No, I don't know that.
L 5 Q. Do you know if that takes into
L 6	account people who got sick and had to quit
L 7	and ultimately died from smoking?
L8 A. No, I don't know that.
L 9 Q. Do you know if that takes into
10	account, for example, your friend who quit
11	smoking, then he died from smoking, right?
12	A. Yes, he did.
13	Q. So he would be within the
14	category of the 50 percent that quit but it
15	didn't do him any good, correct?
219
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
3	A. True.
4	Q. So the 50 percent of people
5	who quit could include people who were
6	never addicted, people who quit because
7	they were so sick they couldn't smoke
8	anymore or people who quit then a few years
9	later died anyway, correct?
10	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
11	A. It may have included those
12	categories, yes.
13	Q. Then the other 50 percent of
14	the people were people who just couldn't
15	quit, right?
16	A. I don't know if they couldn't
17	or why they didn't, but yes, they were
18	still smoking.
19	Q. Do you know anything about
20	people who tried -- strike that.
21	Nowadays you know as a
22	historian that there are things available
2 3	such as the patch, the gum and medications
2	4	and hypnosis and laser treatments that they
25	didn't have — well, they might have had
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	hypnosis, but the patch, the gum, do you
3	know if they were available without
4	prescription?
5	A. I don't know exactly, but the
6	clinics were offering people advice on how
7	to quit smoking and did include, obviously
8	from the beginning they included hypnosis,
9	but they also included other aids that
10	these clinics might have developed or
11	psychologic counseling they were using.
12	Q. But they were pretty archaic,
13	they had these water filters that really
14	don't work, they weren't very effective
15	what they had back then compared to what we
16	have today, correct?
17	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
18	A. Not as extensive or as well
19	researched as we have today, yes.
20	Q. For example, today we have the
21	patch, the gum, we have Zantac, we have
22	Zyban, we have laser treatments, correct?
23	A. I don't know about laser
2 4	treatments, but you have all the others,
2	5	yes.
221
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Despite some of the best
3	things available, some people still can’t
4	quit. Did you know that?
5	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
6	form.
7	A. I assume that, yes, since they
8	are still smoking, assuming they went to
9	these aids. I don't know that.
10	Q. You have read the surgeon
11	general reports or just the statements in
12	popular press or the statements in the
13	media from the surgeon general?
14	A. I have mainly read the
15	statements in the media, because I was
16	trying to determine how well publicized
17	they were, and the '64 report was
18	extensively covered, so there was no real
19	reason to read it in any detail.
20	I paid slightly more attention
21	maybe to the '86 and '88 reports, but again,
2	2	they were extensively covered, so there is
23	no real reason for me to read them in their
24	entirety at all.
25	O. Do you have a copy of the '88
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	report?
3	A. No, I don't.
4	Q. How did you read it?
5	A. I am saying what I read was so
6	extensively covered I didn't have to go to
7	it to read page by page.
8	The same is true of the '86
9	report. I had a copy of the '64 report, but
10	again, the coverage was so extensive I
11	didn't need to read it.
12	Q. Have you ever read the '88 or
13	'89 report, whether online or in some other
14	form?
15	A. I have looked at the '89
16	report because it was again one of these
17	general review reports.
18	Q. Are you familiar with the fact
19	in your review of information that the
2 0	surgeon general made the statement that
21	smoking is not a matter of free choice?
22	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
2 3 A. I'm not sure I am aware. I
2 4	was aware of that statement from the '89
2	5	report. The concern of the surgeon general
223
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	I thought in the '89 report was that
3	despite all the information out there, in
4	his estimation people were still continuing
5	to smoke.
6	Q. Did you read the '89 report
7	online or you ordered a copy of it?
8	A. I ordered a copy of that.
9	Q. So you have a copy in your
10	personal library?
11	A. I have it back in Montana,
12	yes.
13	Q. Will you do me a favor and
14	take the time to review it before trial and
15	see if you can reference the part where it
16	says that because of the age of initiation
17	and the addictive nature of nicotine, the
18	surgeon general has determined that smoking
19	is not a matter of free choice?
2 0	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
21	A. I guess I could, but I don't
2 2	remember that.
23	Q. Do you remember seeing that?
24	A. No, I don't.
2	5 Q. Do you remember statements
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	made in the news after the '88 report
3	regarding the addictive nature of nicotine,
4	it was determined that smoking is not a
5	matter of free choice?
6	A. No, I don't.
7	Q. You don't remember seeing
8	anything like that in your reliance
9	materials?
10	A. No.
11	Q. As a historian, did you learn
12	that in the 50s, 60s and throughout the 70s ,
13	that there were really millions of smokers
14	who were relying upon the statements of the
15	tobacco companies and the TIRC and the TI,
16	that it had not been proven and that they
17	were researching it and the dangerous
18	ingredients would be removed, did you leam
19	that?
20	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
21	form.
22	A. Only to the degree their
23	statements were printed in the mass media
24	or appeared in statements and interviews on
2	5	television.
225
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. But through your readings and
3	through the interviews that you saw, you
4	learned that there were throughout the
5	years millions of smokers who were relying
6	upon those statements?
7	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
8	A. I have no way of knowing that
9	millions of smokers were relying on them.
10	I know they appeared in some of the news
11	stories and in some of the television
12	programs.
13	Q. You agree today it is not
14	considered to be fashionable or glamorous
15	or sexy to smoke?
16	MR. DAVIS: I object to die
17	form of the question.
18	A. Again, if you look at a book
19	like David Cartwright's, he shows the
2 0	changing cultural patterns associated with
21	smoking.
22	Q. What was that book? It might
23	be interesting to me.
24	A. It's called — the subtitle is
2	5	The Influence of Cigarette Smoking on..........
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	American Culture, and I can't quite think
3	of the first two words of it, of the title,
4	but what he shows is just changing cultural
5	patterns associated with smoking, beginning
6	with it being a lower-class phenomenon when
7	cigarettes were first manufactured, how it
8	then continued to have that element to it
9	throughout the 20s, 30s and 40s, but
L 0	increasingly it became a middle-class
L1	virtue.
L 2	His book is called The Forces
13	of Habit, and consequently he shows that it
. 4	became a middle-class virtue, and how now in
L 5	this time period it is a cultural pattern
L 6	that can be discerned, that it is relatively
L 7	uneducated, poor people who continue to
. 8	smoke in greater numbers than the middle
, 9	class people who started to smoke in the
>0	30s.
11	Q. Nowadays cigarettes are like
12	$7 a pack, right?
13	A. Here in New York they are
14	$7.80.
15	Q. Despite the fact they are so
227
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	expensive, it is the poor people who are
3	smoking them, correct?
4	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
5	A. According to cultural trends,
6	one would assume that is the case, but you
7	still have people who can better afford to
8	smoke also smoldng.
9	Q. How do you explain as a
10	historian that cigarettes are so expensive,
11	yet now it is a cultural phenomenon for the
12	poor when they can least afford it?
13	MR. DAVIS: I object to the
14	form.
15	A. I don’t know if I can explain L6	it.
17	People of all socioeconomic	!
18	levels continue to do things that aren't
19	necessarily healthy, whether they can afford !
20	it or not. People gamble, people drink too 1
21	much, whether they can afford it or not	1
22	Q. But the nicotine — I just	: 2 3	wonder if you would believe as a historian ! 2 4	that poor people who can't afford to smoke i
2	5	can't afford to smoke but continue to smoke i
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	because they like the taste of it or
3	because they are addicted?
4	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
5	A. I have no way of answering
6	that
7	All I am responding to is that
8	the David Cartwright book shows cultural
9	changing patterns with respect to smoking.
10	Q. That was one of the books you
11	read back in '94 or '95?
12	A. I read that — I think I was
13	able to read that by ’95, yes.
14	Q. Going back to my question, we
15	know now --1 guess you know from reading
16	that book — in the 50s it was portrayed as
17	being a glamorous, cool, sexy thing to do,
18	correct?
19	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
20	A. In certain formats, yes.
21	Q. Nowadays I think you would
22	agree smoking — you can't smoke in a
2 3	restaurant or an airplane. You would agree
2	4	nowadays it is no longer portrayed as a
25	sexy, educated, smart thing to do?
229
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
3	A. It is not as socially
4	acceptable. In some of the depositions I
5	have read, people indicate that, that it
6	became more and more difficult to smoke.
7	Q. At what point in time did it
8	become no longer glamorous or smart or sexy
9	to smoke cigarettes?
LO	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
L1 Compound question.
L2 A. I don't know exactly. The
L3	books that deal with cultural trends
14	indicate that it's coming in in the 1970s
L 5	as you get questions about whether you can
L 6	smoke in public places, whether you can
L7	smoke on airlines, and consequently you see
L 8	here in New York people smoking outside of
L 9	apartment buildings and office buildings,
10	so you get that coming in generally in the
11	70s and increasingly in the 80s and down to
12	the present day.
13	Q. So we can agree in the 50s and
14	60s smoking was still being portrayed as
25	something glamorous or sexy to do?
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
3	A. No. Because of these
4	scientific studies which were being
5	reported on, it wasn't generally portrayed
6	as sexy or glamorous. It was just
7	portrayed as being unhealthy.
8	Q. If I showed you advertisements
9	or school textbooks that say that's how
10	smoking was portrayed, you would disagree
11	with that, in the 50s or 60s?
12	MR. DAVIS: Objection to form.
13	A. You certainly couldn't show me
14	any textbook that says this is a glamorous,
15	sexy thing for students to do.
16	Q. No. That the textbooks say it
17	is being portrayed as something glamorous
18	or sexy to do.
19	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
2 0 A. A couple of textbooks take on
21	advertising, but they simply tell the
22	students to be somewhat suspect or to 2 3	scrutinize carefully all advertising.
2 4	They don't necessarily single
2	5	out smoking advertising, though usually it
231
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	appears in the health chapters on the
3	warnings about advertising.
4	Q. I have seen school textbooks
5	where they describe it as being advertised
6	as something glamorous to do. You are not
7	familiar with those textbooks?
8	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
9	A. Not in that specific way.
10	They do discuss advertising. I haven't
11	seen — I know die Burkhart textbook
12	doesn't do that, and I am quite sure the
13	Wheat one doesn't either.
14	There might be some textbooks,
15	but I haven't seen many that do that.
16	Q. Do you think it was being
17	advertised as a glamorous thing to do in
18	the 50s?
19	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
2 0 A. To the degree that good
21	looking people were in some of these ads,
22	it could be said to be glamorous. The 2 3	problem with glamor is it doesn't
2 4	necessarily equate with healthy.
2	5 Q. I am not asking you about_
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	healthy though. I am asking you about
3	glamorous. There were movie stars in the
4	advertising, correct?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. And they were getting the good
7	looking man, correct?
8	A. Yes. Not always. Humphrey
9	Bogart wasn't terribly good looking.
10	Q. We have tons of advertisements
11	in the 50s and 60s from Phillip Morris. I
12	just want to know if you believe — I'm
13	going to show the ads to the jury; the
14	Julie London ad, the advertisements with
15	women and so forth.
16	Do you dispute the fact that
17	Phillip Morris was portraying smoking as
18	glamorous in the 1950s?
19	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
20	A. I don't dispute it at all, in
21	some of the ads.
22	Q. Do you agree they were
2 3 portraying smoking to be glamorous in the
24	60s?
2	5_MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
233
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. I diink to a lesser degree
3	because of the restrictions placed on
4	health claims.
5	The ads in the 60s and the
6	slogans became more bland and more generic
7	or general, so you had a couple or something
8	advertising Salems, saying you can take the
9	Salem into die country but you can't take
10	the country out of tiie Salem.
11	That became a very general,
12	generic way to portray cigarettes in many of
13	these ads.
14	Q. Was that in the 60s?
15	A. Yes, because it had to be
16	since -- once they couldn’t make the claims
17	for health and diey were restricted on
18	their celebrity ads by the 60s.
19	Q. I'm going to go through some
20	of your disclosure with you, okay?
21	A. Okay.
22	Q. It says you are expected to
23	testify the public has been aware of the
24	health risks of smoking, including risks
2	5	with contracting cancer and COPD from
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	smoking cigarettes. Do you see that?
3	A. Yes.	'
4	Q. When is it diat you say the
5	public — I think you told me you think the
6	public was aware that smoking caused COPD
7	in the late 60s; is that correct?
8	A. Yes. The specificity of
9	contracting cancer and COPD and
1	0	cardiovascular disease, that would come
L1	later after the scientific reports came
1	2	out.
13	Q. Ma'am, if you can just answer
14	my question.
15	Am 1 correct, in your opinion,
16	the public became aware that smoking could L 7	cause COPD in the 60s?
18	A. I think I said earlier it
19	began to come out of the scientific studies
20	of the 60s, and cardiovascular came before
21	that.
22	Q. Ma'am, I have to ask you
2	3	again. My client doesn't have a claim for 2 4	that. 1 don't know why you want to talk
2	5	about that.
235
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	It was your opinion that the
3	public became aware that smoking cigarettes
4	may cause COPD in the late 60s?
5	A. Yes, it did appear in some of
6	these scientific studies beginning in the
7	late 60s.
8	Q. Do you know when the public
9	became aware of what COPD means and it is
10	an incurable disease and you can suffer
11	from it?
12	A. No, I don't, because of the
13	complications you just noted.
14	Q. Then you said that the public
15	has long been aware of the habit forming or
16	addictive properties of cigarette smoking?
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. Do you think habit and
19	addiction are the same thing?
20	A. They are used interchangeably
21	in literature going back to the
22	19th century.
2 3	They are probably not the same
2	4	tiling, but they are — in the mass media and
25	in general awareness studies see the two_
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	terms used interchangeably.
3	Q. Do you understand what it
4	means to be addicted to nicotine, now in
5	2010 what that means?
6	A. I don't understand the
7	scientific definition, no.
8	Q. Do you know if you inhale the
9	nicotine it gets into the blood system, it
10	goes into the brain and causes changes in
11	the brain and things of that nature, do you
12	know that?
13	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
14	A. I am generally aware of
15	physiological changes associated with
16	addicting products, yes.
17	Q. When they were talking about
18	nicotine or cigarettes being habit forming
19	and addictive in the early 1900s, do you 2 0	think they were talking about it in the
21	degree in which we are aware of it today?
22	A. No.	"
23	Q. So when you say habit forming
24	or addictive properties of cigarettes, you
2	5	mean in the early 1900s, in the 50s, even
237
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	into the 60s people thought that cigarettes
3	were a habit, you can kick the habit, and
4	they used the term addiction
5	interchangeably with that understanding?
6	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
7	A. They were used
8	interchangeably, yes.
9	Q. What do they mean? Do they
10	mean addiction as we know it today?
11	A. I think —
12	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
13	A. I think they really didn't
14	distinguish.
15	When they said habit forming or
16	habituation, they were usually equating that
17	with addiction or addictive, and there
18	really was no clear distinction being made,
19	either physiologically or any other way.
20	Q. When is it that people began
21	to be aware — you said the public has been 2 2	long aware of the addictive properties of
23	cigarettes.
2 4	When did the public become
2	5	aware of the addictive nature of cigarettes
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	as we understand it now?
3	A. As we understand it now, you
4	are relegating that to the surgeon
5	general's report.
6	Q. Which report?
7	A. Of 1998.
8	Q. '88?
9	A. I'm sorry. '88.
10	Q. Then it says you will address
11	common knowledge of national and local
12	sources. Do you see that?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Do you know knowledge is
15	different from awareness? You know that,
16	don't you?
17	A. Yes, but common knowledge is a
18	term used by the historical profession to
19	convey either general awareness, sometimes
20	to convey conventional wisdom, sometimes
21	simply to convey common sense, so it is a 2 2	term that historians use and is found in
2 3	our disciplines as well to convey that
2 4	widespread general information that's out
2	5	there in any society on a variety of
239
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	topics.
3	Q. So you are going to be
4	talking — when you say common knowledge,
5	you mean awareness as opposed to belief?
6	A. Yes. Very definitely.
7	Q. Just because you are saying
8	there was awareness in the 60s and 70s
9	about the health hazards of smoking, you
10	don't have any opinions as to what the
11	belief levels were during that time period?
12	A. That's true.
13	Q. You understand that belief is
14	not the same as awareness, correct?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. And you would expect die
17	belief levels to be lower than awareness
18	levels in the 60s and 70s?
19	A. Yes.
20	Q. To what extent you don't know;
21	is that correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q- I don't know what the next
2 4	sentence means. Can you tell me what it
2	5	means; that both types of awarenesses have
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	been reflected and reinforced in every
3	aspect of society, what does that mean?
4	A. Well, the both types refers to
5	the health hazards associated with tobacco
6	products or cigarettes, and the other is
7	the habit forming or addictive nature of
8	cigarettes, and then it says long been
9	reflected and reinforced in virtually every
10	aspect of American society.
11	Q. In terms of awareness, you
12	also said in the 60s and 70s that there
13	was --
14 MR. PAIGE: I don't know what
15	that is. Is somebody moving the mic?
16	MR. DAVIS: We are not moving
17	anything here. We are getting it from
18	you. I think when you hit the table
19	at your end it comes to our end and it
20	goes back. It's very sensitive.
21	Q. In the 60s and 70s we talked
22	about there was a level of awareness in the 2 3	public that there were statements being
2	4	made that smoking has not been proven to
25	cause cancer or more research is needed,
241
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	right?
3	A. Yes.
4	Q. What were the levels of
5	belief, die belief levels for that
6	awareness? You would also expect that to
7	lag behind as well?
8	A. In those two decades, yes.
9	Q. In the 60s and 70s, although
10	people were aware that smoking may not
11	cause — in the 60s and 70s there were
12	people who were aware that smoldng may
13	cause lung cancer, correct?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And there were people who
16	believed it, correct --
17	A. Yes.
18	Q. — to be true, and the belief
19	level, you would expect the belief level to
20	be lower than the awareness level, you just
21	don't know to what degree; is that correct?
22	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
23	A. I think I answered that
2	4	before.
25	O- I think you said yes.
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. Then the same would be true
4	about there was a level of awareness in the
5	public in the 60s and 70s that it hadn't
6	been proven diat smoking caused lung
7	cancer, and there were certain people who
8	believed that to be true as well, correct?
9	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
L 0 A. I can't really say that from
L1	my research, because I am only doing
L2	general awareness on these two topics of
L 3	health hazards and habituating nature of
L 4	cigarettes.
L 5 Q, Through your experience,
L 6	knowledge and training, you would expect
L 7	that the belief levels, that it had not
L 8	been proven or that the dangerous
L 9	ingredients would be removed would be lower
10	than the awareness levels as well?
21	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
12	A. I think so, yes.
13	Q. But you don't know to what
14	degree?
25	A. That's true.
243
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Would the same hold true for
3	both of those propositions for die health
4	hazards on die unhealthy part of smoking in
5	the 80s as well?
6	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
7	A. Well, the awareness level is
8	much higher in the 80s.
9	Q. In the 80s and 90, the gap
10	between awareness and belief is really
11	getting closer together, correct?
12	MR. DAVIS: I object to form.
13	A. I don't know, because I just
14	don't look at polls for diose decades, but
15	the awareness level, given my research, is
16	much higher by the 1980s than it was, let's
17	say, in the 1930s or 40s.
18	Q. Then says you are expected to
19	testify about public attitudes and
20	information about use and health risks of
21	tobacco use. What does that mean?
22	A. It means that part of my
2	3	research has to do with popular culture,
2	4	which is a reflection of public attitudes,
25	as you have the scientific studies
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	publicized beginning in the 50s, but even
3	before the 50s you find that popular
4	culture developed slang terms to refer to
5	cigarettes and the habit forming nature of
6	cigarettes, so that public attitudes are
7	always reflected in popular culture and
8	slang terms, which can then be found in a
9	lot of places; movies, cartoons, comic
10	strips, songs.
11	That's how you determine public
12	attitudes, is you look at popular culture.
13	Q. You also said that you will
14	opine die fact that it's difficult to quit,
15	that there was an awareness that it's
16	difficult to quit?
17	A. Where is that exactly?
18	Q. Next paragraph.
19	A. Difficult to quit. I have it.
2	0	Yes.
21	Q. Did you learn through your
2	2	review of the news and the literature that
2	3	some people were highly addicted and cannot
2	4	quit?
25	A. It's not the kind of research
245
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	I would do basically, because it seems more
3	medical type of research than I would
4	normally do.
5	Q. What do you mean by difficult
6	to quit?
7	A. That means that you have
8	people indicating in this deposition and in
9	other depositions that they have had a hard
10	time quitting and that you find, for
11	example, cartoons in major newspapers
12	indicating to people how difficult it is to
13	quit by having people referred to as
14	nicotine fiends or having nicotine fits.
15	It's throughout the popular
16	culture that you can see this kind of
17	information being conveyed and people
18	understanding what it meant.
19	Q. Do you have any other opinions
2	0	that you expect to testify to that we
21	haven't discussed today?
22	A. I don’t think so, except for
2	3	the fact that I haven't really been able to
2	4	indicate to you in detail the sources I
2	5	used for this review I did of tiiese
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	subjects.
3	Q. You can tell me if you want
4	to. I don't know what you are talking
5	about.
6	A. It's some of the things we
7	talked about. Obviously for me to
8	determine general awareness, I had to look
9	at the mass media, and as that mass media
10	changed from print media to television —
11	Q. Let me stop you. I have your
12	reliance list. Is that what you are
13	referring to?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. You are referring to your
16	reliance list?
17	A. Primarily, and the fact then
18	that you have the educational materials in
19	that reliance materials, you have the fact
20	I referred to both antismoking reform
21	groups, then national health groups lilce
2	2	the American Cancer Society, then that I
2	3	looked at popular culture and looked
2	4	finally at the family history of the
2	5	plaintiff in dais case.
247
1	DR. J. HOFF
2	Q. Are you going to want to
3	review the depositions of the doctors who
4	may testify who have treated her about how
5	addicted she was? Are you interested in
6	that?
7	A. No. I have no expertise to
8	evaluate those.
9	Q. Do you have any questions for
10	me?
11	A. I don't think so.
12	MR. PAIGE: I don’t have
13	anything further. Thank you very
14	much.
15	MR. DAVIS: Thank you. She
16	will read die transcript. We have no
