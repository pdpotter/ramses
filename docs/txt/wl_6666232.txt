ELIZABETH COBBS HOFFMAN, PH.D., Called as a witness by and on behalf of the Plaintiff, and having been first duly
sworn by the Deposition Officer, was examined and testified as follows:
EXAMINATION
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Good morning, Dr. Hoffman.
A Good morning.
Q My name is Brent Bigger. I'm an attorney with the law firm of Abrahamson, Uiterwyk & Barnes in Tampa, Florida, and we
represent Florence Patterson, who is the plaintiff in this case that we're here on today.
You are aware, obviously, that you've been listed as an expert witness in the Patterson case?
A Yes.
Q Okay. I'll probably just refer to it as the Patterson case, if that's all right.
A That's fine.
Q You've had your deposition taken before?
A Yes.
Q So you're familiar with the usual nuances? If you don't understand a question, let me know, and I'll restate it. If you do answer,
I'm going to assume that you understood it.
There may be objections to the form of the question from time to time. If there are, it's okay. You go ahead and answer the
question unless the attorneys who are here for the tobacco companies instruct you otherwise. They're just preserving their
record. All those usual kind of things. You're familiar with those procedures?

3In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A Yes, I am.
Q Okay. So we'll kind of use the same today as it has been in the past.
This case, the Patterson case, is what's known as an Engle Progeny case. Are you aware of the Engle class action lawsuit that
started in 1994 in Florida?
A Yes.
Q How did you become aware of the Engle class action?
A I think an attorney told me about it.
Q Do you remember which attorney?
A No.
Q Okay.
Do you remember when the attorney told you about it?
A I remember hearing about it when Engle was a case. So I think that was in the early 2000's.
Q By “case” you mean back when it was still a class action?
A Correct.
Q Okay.
At that time were you working as an expert witness in other non-Florida cases?
A Yes.
Q Was that perhaps the Boeken case that you were working on?
A I'm not sure of the timing.
Q Okay. We'll get into the -- your involvement in tobacco litigation in just a second. I just want to explore this Engle -- your
familiarity with Engle.
Do you have any understanding of what makes an Engle Progeny case unique or different from another tobacco case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: Not really.
MR. BIGGER: We had said before that one objection for one defendant is the same for others unless noted otherwise. So only
one of you needs to object and it will be good for all the defendants.

4In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
MS. LINDSAY: That's fine.
MR. BIGGER: Okay.
MS. CHUANG: Thank you.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Has anyone ever explained to you what the Engle class action did? In other words, what its legal rulings were that affected
the Engle Progeny cases?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I have not gotten a detailed explanation of it.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay. What explanation of it did you get?
A That these were cases that were an outcome of the rulings in the first Engle case and that there would be quite a few cases;
therefore, they would likely be coming forward as a result of that.
Q Has anyone told you the number of cases that there are statewide?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I've heard not really. I have just heard vague kinds of references to there being many, many cases.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
Has anyone ever informed you about what's known as the Phase 1 findings from the first phase of the Engle class action?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, I don't someone may have talked about it, but it wasn't something I focused on since it was not pertinent
to the research I was doing.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
I will represent to you that there are these what are commonly known as the Phase 1 findings. There are several different legal
findings that were made by the jury in the first phase of the class action back in 1999 when it was a class action.
I just wanted to mention briefly two of them and see if you had ever been informed of these two.

5In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
One of the findings is regarding fraudulent concealment and generally not specifically word for word the finding but generally
is that the defendants, the tobacco companies, fraudulently concealed information regarding the health effects and the addictive
nature of smoking cigarettes.
Has anyone ever discussed that finding with you?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, we haven't had any lengthy conversation about those findings.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
There's another finding that -- again, just generally speaking but not, you know word for word -- is that the tobacco companies,
the defendants in this case, conspired together or -- let me correct that -- that they agreed to conceal information regarding the
health effects and the addictive nature of smoking cigarettes.
Has anyone ever discussed that finding or a variation of that finding with you?
A No.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
Has anyone ever provided you any background information on the Engle class action, other than what we've already talked
about?
A No.
Q Okay.
Has anyone ever instructed you to conduct research differently or research different areas or look at different information
because of these findings that we discussed or the Phase 1 findings from the Engle class action?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
So, in other words, you had been involved with tobacco litigation previously in the state of California; correct?
A Correct.

6In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q And you weren't tasked with any different assignment for your services as an expert witness in these Engle Progeny cases?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: They're the -- it's the same type of research. So, no, there was never any instruction to that effect.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
Have you read or reviewed any testimony from the Engle class action?
A No.
Q Okay. Do you plan to?
A No.
Q Have you read or reviewed any testimony from any of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses in this case, the Patterson case?
A No.
Q Okay.
Do you plan to review any testimony before trial?
A Did you say of expert witnesses?
Q Yes. Yes, Ma'am. Expert witnesses the plaintiff has retained in this Patterson case.
A I can't say. I don't know if I will need to do that down the road. It's possible that something would come forward that would
be pertinent. But I just don't know what that would be.
Q Do you have a specific plan to do that at this time?
A I don't have a specific plan at this time.
Q Okay.
MR. BIGGER: Let me just mark as Exhibit 1 the Notice of Taking Deposition Duces Tecum for the Patterson case.
Off the record.
(Off the record.)
(Whereupon Exhibit 1 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
MR. BIGGER: We'll go back on.

7In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Dr. Hoffman, I handed you what we marked as Exhibit 1, which is the Plaintiff's Amended Notice of Taking Deposition
Duces Tecum in the Patterson case.
Have you seen this document before today?
A I believe I saw this document yesterday briefly.
Q Okay. Who provided the document to you?
A I believe it was Paul Koethe.
Q Mr. Koethe is a lawyer with the law firm of Jones Day?
A That's correct.
Q And his law firm represents R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
A As I understand it.
Q Okay.
Before yesterday you had not received this document?
A No.
Q Okay.
Where were you when Mr. Koethe handed you this document?
A I was here in this law office.
Q Okay. You had a meeting here?
A Yes, we did.
Q Who else was present at that meeting?
A Janna Lindsay was also here.
Q I take it from the way you said that that may have been the first time you met Ms. Lindsay?
A That's correct.
Q Okay. Had you met Mr. Koethe before?
A Yes, I had.

8In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Had you worked with Mr. Koethe before?
A Yes, I have.
Q Okay. Which cases was that?
A I worked with him on the Brown case in California.
Q Okay.
Is that the class action that just had that ruling, or is that a different case?
A I am not sure what ruling you're talking about.
Q Okay. There was something on the news the other day about the California Supreme Court. I just didn't know in that was
that case or not. Not important here.
You'll see attached to this Notice of Taking Deposition Duces Tecum -- excuse me. Before I get to that, was anyone else present
at the meeting?
A No.
Q Okay.
Other than the Notice of Deposition Duces Tecum which we'll get to in a minute, what else was discussed at this meeting
yesterday?
A We discussed my findings.
Q Okay. The findings of your research?
A The findings of my research.
Q Okay. And that would be your opinions in this case?
A Yes. That would be the outcome of that.
MR. BIGGER: We'll go off the record.
(Off the record.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q We were talking about the meeting that you had with the attorneys from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and you said you
discussed your findings, and I think I had asked you if that includes your opinions that you've come to in this case.
A Correct.

9In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Is there anything else that you would include under the term findings that you discussed yesterday?
A We discussed some of the exhibits.
Q What exhibits?
A Well, in particular, I brought to the meeting some very recent research I had done and that they had -- weren't aware of.
So we discussed that.
Q Are these items that you plan to add to your reliance list? Is that what you're talking about?
A Yes, they are.
Q Okay.
These aren't demonstrative exhibits that you intend to use at trial, or are they?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: They could be.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
A They could become that.
Q That's not your intention in discussing them yesterday? Your intention in discussing them yesterday was to indicate these
were things that should be added to your reliance list?
A Right. They should be added to the list of materials that we gave you earlier.
Q Right. Which, you know -- I think we have a copy of it here.
And when I say reliance list, I'm indicating the list of documents, news clips, film clips, et cetera, that was provided to us most
recently on May 22nd, 2009.
So, when I say reliance list, can we have the understanding that's what I'm referring to?
A Certainly.
Q And in this case, for the Patterson case, I know there was it's customary to provide one for different cases. We have one for
the deposition that will be taking place later as well, but we'll just call that the reliance list.
A Okay.
Q All right. We'll all understand what I'm talking about.
A I certainly will.

10In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Perfect.
So at your meeting yesterday you had some additional research that you had found and that you think should be added to the
reliance list.
Is that the reliance list for the Patterson case or is that something that you plan to use in future cases?
A That pertains to the second case we expect to discuss tomorrow.
Q Okay. We'll get into that later on. All right. It's stuff that's not on there currently but you have it with you?
A I do have it with me. And I should say it pertains more strongly to the second case, although it could also be pertinent to
the Patterson case.
Q Okay.
A It's just the one on there at this point.
Q The suspense is killing me. Do you have it with you? Can I see what you brought, what we're talking about?
A Yes, you can. It's the 4-H documents.
Q Okay. The various 4-H materials?
A Yes. I'm sorry. You're right. The various 4-H materials.
Q I'm glad, because I don't want to get into the other case, obviously, but those items were not included on the disk. So it's
nice to have what they are.
MS. LINDSAY: I would say for the record we were going to make sure that you had those.
MR. BIGGER: Right.
MS. LINDSAY: We got them this morning and we wanted to give them to you today as well. So at a break when we go to
the Evers case, we'll cover that.
MR. BIGGER: Okay.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Anything else that was discussed at this meeting yesterday?
A We discussed the kinds of questions that you might ask.
Q Okay.
So typical deposition preparation, that sort of thing?

11In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A I don't know what the typical deposition preparation would be.
Q Well, you've given depositions in the past or you've had your deposition taken in the past?
A Correct.
Q Was it the type of preparation that you have experienced preparing for past depositions?
A I would say it was similar.
Q Okay.
Was there stuff that was specific to the Patterson case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
MR. BIGGER: Yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Were there questions that were specific to the Patterson case?
A Not per se, no.
Q Was there any discussion regarding Florence Patterson's personal history?
A I think it might have come up a little bit, but honestly it wasn't a big focus. So I don't recall.
Q Okay.
In the course of preparing for the opinions you're going to render in this case, did you review depositions from the Patterson case?
A I did review several depositions.
Q Okay.
Did you review what's known as a verified worksheet in the Patterson case?
A I did. I did review that.
Q Anything else for the Patterson case that you reviewed to prepare to give your opinions in the Patterson case?
A Well, of course, I reviewed all the materials on the list that we've discussed.
Q The materials on the reliance list?
A Correct. And, then as we just said, the depositions and the verified back sheet.
Q Anything else?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
12In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A Not that I recall.
Q Okay. We'll get into some of the details.
A Sure.
Q But I just wanted to see what the umbrella is before we get underneath it.
So depositions, verified worksheet and the reliance list?
A Mm-hmm. That sounds about right.
Q Nothing else?
A Not that I can think of.
Q Okay. If it changes, just let me know.
Coming back to the Notice of Deposition Duces Tecum, if we can turn to Exhibit A, which is attached to that document in
front of you, Exhibit 1 --
A Okay. All right.
Q At the meeting --
A The third page?
Q Yes, Ma'am.
A Okay.
Q At the meeting yesterday did you go through this document --
A Yes.
Q this exhibit?
A Again, I wasn't holding it. So, you know, at least we were talking about the things that were on it. So, yes, I'm aware of the list.
Q But you were instructed that these were the items that you are to bring to the deposition today subject to objections which
have been filed by the attorneys for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
A That's correct.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

13In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Okay.
So the first one is a copy of your most recent CV?
A Right.
Q Did you bring a copy today?
A Yes, I did.
Q Okay.
And this is more recent than the CV we were provided in September of 2008?
A Yes, it would be.
Q Okay.
MR. BIGGER: I'll have this marked as Exhibit 2.
(Whereupon Exhibit 2 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you just have the one copy?
A Of that, yes. Well, I mean I have only to give you. I have other copies.
MR. BIGGER: If you want copies, we can get them made at break, I guess. We'll have a copy is that right, we can have a
copy of this made at the break?
MS. LINDSAY: That's fine.
MR. BIGGER: Okay. That way she can have a copy.
THE WITNESS: I have my own copy.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Oh, you do? Okay. All right. So you have a copy of this?
A Yes.
Q All right.
A I have a copy of what I gave you.
MR. BIGGER: Then if you guys want a copy --

14In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
MS. LINDSAY: I actually have a copy as well.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
Well, I haven't taken the time and I don't want to take the time to compare this with your CV that was disclosed previously.
Can you just quickly tell me what on here is different from your previous CV?
A One of the first things that I spot is under 2008 I was a jury member for the Pulitzer Prize for History.
Q Okay.
A So that's new on there.
Q Does a jury member signify that you were on the selection committee?
A Yes. It was a three-person, and I was a member of that jury which selected the --
Q You can tell I'm not --
(Whereupon the Deposition Officer requested all parties to speak one at a time.
THE WITNESS: I was a member of a three-person jury that recommended the finalists for the prize in history.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You can tell that I'm not familiar with the Pulitzer process, not being a journalist and not being a great literary person. And
I apologize.
I know you do have a strong literary background but -- so I was unfamiliar. I had to ask what it was.
Anything on there that is different since the CV we received a few months ago?
A I'm sorry. I need to take a minute just to look at this.
Q That's fine.
A I'm not sure. I think I might have added the editorial service for the H-Diplo editorial board. That's all that jumps out at me.
Q Okay.
A I think there might be a conference or a paper or two that's not on here, but they would not be very exciting to you.
Q Okay.

15In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A I think that's all. It's possible that the articles in the Washington Independent, I might not have gotten those on yet because
there's an August 29 date there, for example, and it's possible it wasn't on the September date. But most of the things are pretty
much the same.
Q I'll review this on a break and just see if there's anything that catches my eye.
Looking at No. 2 on this exhibit it asks for all facts and data upon which you base any opinion.
MS. LINDSAY: And I'm just going to note our objection for the record that we believe this was provided on her reliance list.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Is it your opinion or is it your understanding that your reliance list is what you would believe is all facts and data upon which
you base your opinions in this case?
MS. LINDSAY: Well, I'm going to object to form again because one of our objections was very overbroad as well as vague.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You can answer.
A Thank you.
It's a bit of a hard question to answer in the sense that I have other data and facts in my head.
Q Life experience?
A Life experience that I can't put on a reliance list.
Q I understand.
A That I can't put on paper. So there would be a broader universe of information, for example, about American history into
which this reliance list would fit, would be a big, big piece of that puzzle.
So I can't put everything on that list. But the list is certainly very fullsome in documenting the facts and data that I've found
over the years of my research.
MR. BIGGER: We're going to mark this, and I don't have a copy of it, but I'm sure you guys do. We'll mark this as Exhibit 3.
(Whereupon Exhibit 3 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q This is your reliance list for the Patterson case -- I'll just make sure -- that was provided on May the 22nd, 2009.
And the list references three DVD's, one of which is mostly documents, or maybe all documents. I haven't reviewed it all, to
be honest. And it is -- I've got it in here. 5,301 images -- documents that are contained on that DVD, and there are two other
DVD's that contain television and film clips.

16In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
So you're saying that in addition to the 5,301 documents on this reliance list and the DVD's containing the film clips and
television clips, there's other things as well that you weren't able to put on a reliance list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I would have been able to put them on there, but then the reliance list would have been many, many more
pages than that.
So that is a representative selection that gives you a very full picture without giving you every piece of paper I have pertaining
to the subject because it would just be incredibly voluminous, much more so than that.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you know how many pages these 5,301 documents are?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: What do you mean by that?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, each document at times could be multiple pages, not just a single page. So there's more than 5,300 pages here. In fact,
there's likely tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of pages contained on this reliance list.
Do you know exactly how many pages or approximately how many pages of material we're talking about?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I've never sat down to count all the pages.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q But it's your testimony today that you've read all these documents?
A (Witness nodded head.)
Q Have you read each of them, every page?
A Yes, I have.
Q Okay.
But you don't remember how many that was? You don't know how many thousands of pages there are in the reliance materials?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No.

17In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Did you personally collect each and every one of these documents?
A I personally collected them all in the sense that I got copies of them.
Q So you have possession of them?
A I decided what kinds of documents I needed and then went out to get them.
Q Okay. We'll get into that a little bit later too.
A Sure.
Q No. 3 asks for all documents and other materials you referred or relied upon to arrive at opinions or conclusions concerning
the issues of this case.
That, again, would be the reliance list?
MS. LINDSAY: And I'm just going to note for the record the objection we filed.
THE WITNESS: So the question is did I bring -- did I bring all those things? Yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You did bring all the documents?
A Oh, I'm sorry.
Q That's okay.
A We said reports, summaries, impressions and evaluations and those I brought.
Q You know what? I'm looking at No. 3 still.
A I apologize.
Q That's okay.
A Well, yes, I think you should have them all, then, on those three disks --
Q Okay.
A -- that we discussed.
Q Is there anything else, aside from what you said -- the stuff that's in your head, the personal experiences, all those things --
are there any other documents that are not on this reliance list that you're going to rely upon to form your opinions?
A I think I would have to reiterate what I just said, which is that this is a sampling of a large universe.

So, to give you an example of that, there's a selection of Tampa Tribune articles on here, but that would not be all of the Tampa
Tribune articles that I have read or collected.
So I wouldn't expect to need to put all those -- the rest of those articles on exhibit in a trial because these are very good
representative, you know, examples of those other documents.
So, in that sense, yes, there are other documents, but this list will be more than enough to demonstrate my findings.
Q Okay. Like I said, we'll get into the details in the reliance list in just a few minutes.
No. 4 asks for reports, summaries, impressions and evaluations. And it also asks for testing, which is probably not really relevant
to this -- to your expertise.
Do you have a report, a summary, an impression or an evaluation that you prepared that you brought with you today?
A Yes, I --
MS. LINDSAY: I'm sorry. I'm just going to note again our objections that were filed. Overbroad, vague and that these refer
to the reliance list.
Go ahead. I'm sorry.
THE WITNESS: I have brought everything that was pertinent, I think.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
Well, did you prepare any reports for this case?
A I did not prepare a report, no.
Q Have you prepared any summaries?
A I've prepared some summaries for myself.
Q Those are notes?
A Correct.
Q Would you describe them as notes?
A Notes, yeah.
Q Okay. Did you bring those with you today?
A Yes, I did.
Q Okay.

19In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
What about impressions? Would that falling under the same category of notes?
A Yes, it would.
Q Okay.
Nothing else outside of the notes that you've described already?
A No.
Q And evaluations?
A It's the same thing.
Q Same thing?
A (Witness nodded head.)
Q So all the documents that you have are the handwritten notes that you've prepared and brought with you today?
A I have some typewritten notes as well.
Q Okay. I'm sorry. Typewritten notes as well?
A (Witness nodded head.)
Q Anything else?
A No.
Q Okay.
There was a disclosure that was filed in this case. I don't know if -- I presume you've seen it before.
MR. BIGGER: I'll have that marked. That will be 4.
(Whereupon Exhibit 4 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Have you seen this document before, Dr. Hoffman?
A Yes. I've seen this document before.
Q Okay. This was attached to R.J. Reynolds' expert witness disclosures that were made in the Patterson case.
Did you prepare this document?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
20In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A I discussed it with the attorney from Jones Day.
Q Okay.
A So I helped in the preparation of it.
Q You didn't physically type it up yourself?
A No, I did not.
Q Did you dictate it?
A No, I did not.
Q Just it's the product of your discussions with the attorneys?
A Correct.
Q After it was prepared did you review it before it was filed?
A I think I saw it before it was or it's possible it was read to me over the phone.
Q Okay.
A I don't recall.
Q So you had --
A Precisely.
Q -- editorial oversight with it as well --
A Yes.
Q -- just to make sure it was correct?
A Yes, I did.
Q Would you think of this as a report or a summary of your testimony in this case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I consider it exactly what you described it as being, which is a disclosure relating to my expertise.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
Under the section where it says “Subject Matter Of Expert Testimony.”

21In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A (Witness nodded head.)
Q The first sentence says,
“Dr. Hoffman is expected to testify about the vast amount of information communicated and available to the public, including
Florence Patterson, from a wide variety of sources concerning the health risks of cigarette smoking.”
That's still your expected testimony in this case?
A Yes.
Q Okay. The second sentence,
“Dr. Hoffman is expected to testify about the widespread public knowledge during Ms. Patterson's lifetime that cigarette
smoking can be hazardous to health, lead to serious diseases, including cancer and premature death, and be habit-forming,
addictive, and difficult for some people to quit.”
Is that still your expected testimony in this case?
A Yes, it is.
Q Okay.
And the last sentence,
“Dr. Hoffman may also be asked to comment upon the opinions expressed by other witnesses in this matter to the extent that
they relate to her area of expertise.”
You testified earlier you haven't reviewed any depositions at this time. So, presumably, today you're not here to comment on
any opinions that have been expressed by other experts in this case?
A That's correct.
Q Okay. But perhaps at trial?
A Perhaps.
Q Okay. We'll come back to this in a few moments as well.
Do you have those handwritten and typed notes?
A I do. This is the first set. Would you like to take them one by one or should I just tell you --
Q When you say “the first set,” do you mean -- is the second set related to a different case --
A No.
Q -- or the same case?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
22In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A No. I have several things related to this case.
Q What does the first set encompass?
A This set I gave you are the notes that I took based upon the verified worksheet and the depositions of the plaintiffs and the
witnesses that are related to this case.
Q Okay.
A I hope you like my handwriting. I tried to keep it neat for you.
Q As someone who can't write in cursive, it's always nice to see someone who can.
These are all the depositions that you reviewed in this case?
A Yes.
Q Okay. Who provided you each of these depositions?
A I asked for them from Jones Day and they sent them out to me.
Q How did you ask for them?
A I spoke with Paul Koethe and asked that as soon as depositions were available to please send them to me.
Q That maybe was a bad question.
Did you ask for all the depositions of all the fact witnesses that had been taken?
A I'm not sure about your term there because, not being an attorney, I don't know what that quite means.
But I asked for all of the depositions that would be from the plaintiff and from her family and friends, those kind of witness
depositions that are taken usually at the beginning of a case.
Q Okay.
So any limits that were placed on the depositions that you got were placed by the lawyers, not by you?
In other words, you asked for all -- you said, “I want all of them,” and then they -- whatever you received is you presume
was all of them?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I presume that they sent me what I asked for.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Right. I guess you asked for all of them --
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
23In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A I have no way of knowing if they didn't. But I got all the ones that seemed logical to me.
Q Okay. And you asked for all of them?
A All of these kind of depositions that would tell me about her life.
Q The plaintiff, family and friends?
A Correct.
Q Coworkers?
A If there were any, although I don't think in this case that there were any that I recall.
Q But you would have asked for that?
A Oh, yeah, sure, absolutely.
Q Anyone else that I left off that list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q That you typically or that you did ask for?
A Not that I can recall at the moment.
Q Okay.
What's the second set of notes?
A Okay.
The second set is doesn't concern Patterson a lot, but she appears on it because this was -- is a list of cases that I had been
asked to consider being an expert witness in over the last eight or nine months, however long that has been. And so she's one
of the names on here.
Q Okay.
A That's just my thumbnail sketch so I can remember things like birth dates and --
Q This is a list of all the cases in which you were asked to serve as an expert witness. Is that correct? Do I have that right?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not quite sure how that process works. These were cases I was asked to consider, and I requested
information on once I was told, “Would you consider,” you know, “being an expert witness in this case.”
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
24In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
But I'm not certain that I was actually named in them, if you know what I mean.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q That's what I was going to ask.
Do you know which of these cases -- do you know in which of these cases you were disclosed as an expert witness?
A I don't recall. I might have been told. I certainly know that Cindy Evers is one of them that's there, and I just don't know
which -- sometimes they get suspended. Like in fact, there's one on there that I think was suspended.
So, you know, not being an attorney, I don't follow those details very closely. So this is as best as I recall right now, I'm certain
about the Patterson and Evers.
At one time I think that Carolyn Long was on there, and I think at one time I was asked to do research on that case. But, again,
something happened with that case and I'm not longer working on it.
Q Okay.
One of the other requests on this Exhibit A -- I'll jump down a little bit.
But No. 9 is a list identifying all cases in which you have testified at deposition or trial designating which is which for the five
years preceding the date of this notice.
Now, you haven't given a deposition in any of the cases that are on this list of handwritten notes that you just gave me --
A That's correct.
Q -- other than Patterson, which we're taking today, and Evers as well.
Do you have a separate list that indicates the cases in which you've testified at deposition or trial?
A No.
MS. LINDSAY: I'll note our objection again to this request and note that it was provided in her disclosure.
But go ahead.
MR. BIGGER: It actually wasn't provided in her disclosure, which is why it's actually important in this case. In some cases
it is and in this case it wasn't.
THE WITNESS: I have not testified in trial or deposition in the past five years.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You have not?
A I have not.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
25In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Okay.
A So that's why there's no list.
Q Moot point is what you're saying.
A Correct.
Q Okay.
MR. BIGGER: I'm going to mark these notes as Exhibit 5. We'll do it as composite Exhibit 5. I'll look at these at a break. If
I have more questions, I'll come back to them.
(Whereupon Exhibit 5 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I'm going to skip No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7 in detail.
Do you have copies of communications or documents that have passed between you and any of the lawyers for the tobacco
companies?
A Yes, I do.
Q Okay. Did you bring them today?
A I did.
Q Okay. I don't think I'm going to go into those. I just don't have an interest in it, but I was curious if there were any.
What is the ordinary method in which you communicate with the attorneys? Is it e-mail, phone?
A Typically by phone.
Q Okay.
No. 8 asks for all documents that alone or together reflect the scope of your employment -- nice typo there -- the scope of your
employment in these cases generally in the specific case identified above, which is Patterson, your general litigation experience,
including the percentage of work performed for plaintiffs and defendants, and, three, an approximation of the portion of your
involvement as an expert witness based on the number of hours, percentage of hours, percentage of earned income.
Now, your disclosure, which we marked as Exhibit 4, in the last page, page 3, some of this information is provided. That was
4. I think you still have a copy of it. Turn to the last page.
It indicates that the -- your past litigation experience has been for defendants.
A That's correct.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
26In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Have you ever served as an expert witness for plaintiffs in any case?
A Any tobacco case?
Q Any case at all.
A No.
Q So your service as an expert witness has always been for defendants?
A That's correct.
Q Okay.
Have you served as an expert witness in non-tobacco cases?
A No.
Q Okay.
Here again it indicates that you have not testified at trial or deposition during the past five years. And you stated today that
is accurate?
A That is accurate.
Q Okay.
You haven't had any depositions in any Engle Progeny cases before this one?
A I have not.
Q Okay.
And the last sentence is that your involvement as an expert witness in Florida litigation has averaged approximately ten percent
of your time.
Now, it's limited to Florida litigation. What other Florida cases have you worked on?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Do you mean --
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Excuse me. What other Florida tobacco cases have you worked on? Since you said you've only worked in tobacco cases, I
kind of figured that was -- without explanation but, nonetheless, we'll be more specific.
A I gave you a list of cases that I've worked on, and those would be the cases --
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
27In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Okay.
A -- that I'm recalling at this point.
Q So that handwritten list is the only cases that you have worked on in Florida?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: That I recall, yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
A It's pretty comprehensive.
Q Have you ever testified in trial in Florida?
A No.
Q Okay.
Have you ever been deposed previously for any Florida tobacco cases?
A No.
Q Okay.
So before the Engle Progeny cases you had not been involved in tobacco litigation in the state of Florida?
A No, I had not been involved in litigation in Florida.
Q Okay.
Now, you have stated and I'm aware that you have been involved in tobacco litigation in the state of California.
Are there any other states where you were involved with tobacco litigation besides California and now Florida?
A Yes.
Q What other states have you been involved in tobacco litigation?
A New York.
Q Okay.
How many cases were you involved in in New York?
A Two.

28In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Do you remember the names of the cases?
A Yes, I do.
Q What was the first one?
A The first one concerned Robert Gouveia, which is spelled G-O-U-V-E-I-A.
Q The court reporter appreciates that very much I'm sure.
A It's Portuguese.
Q Which is one of the languages you speak.
A Correct.
Q What was the other case?
A This was a case that I started to do research on but ultimately I it didn't go very far forward, at least with me. I believe another
expert was brought in instead.
Q Okay.
A And that case concerned a woman by the name of Nikki, N-I-K-K-I, Poosh, P-O-O-S-H.
Q Do you know approximately what year the Gouveia case was?
A I believe it was 2006, 2007.
Q Okay. Fairly recently, though?
A Pretty recent.
Q What about the Poosh case?
A Overlapped in time. Roughly 2007, I think.
Q Okay.
Do you know which tobacco company retained you as an expert witness in those two cases?
A I wasn't retained by a tobacco company.
Q This is an issue. Let's just try and clear this one up now.
In this case, the Patterson case, you've been retained by the law firm of Jones Day?
A That's correct.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
29In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Okay.
And you understand that Jones Day is representing R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
A I understand that they represent R.J. Reynolds and many other kinds of clients. But, yes, I'm aware that they're representing
them in this case.
Q So you are serving as an expert witness on behalf of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?
A I suppose it's defined that way. I don't know.
Q Okay.
So, rather than to have to explain all that each time, when I say that you're serving as an expert witness on behalf of a tobacco
company, can we just avoid going through that process?
A Sure.
Q Okay.
A What you mean is on behalf of the defendant; right?
Q Right.
A Okay.
Q Which tobacco company were you serving as an -- excuse me. Let me strike that.
On whose behalf were you serving as an expert witness in the Gouveia case?
A I am not dead certain about that. I was again working with Jones Day.
Q Okay.
A And I'd have to review my notes to see what kinds of cigarettes this fellow smoked. So that's the best I can do.
Q But it was through the Jones Day law firm?
A That's correct.
Q Okay. Same thing with the Poosh case?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
Have you ever been retained by another law firm besides Jones Day?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
30In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A Yes, I have.
Q What other law firms have retained you?
A I was retained previously by Johnson, Tyler and Purvis.
Q Okay.
A And also by Shook, Hardy and Bacon.
Q Alan Purvis was, in fact, the first person to contact you about serving as an expert witness. Is that correct?
A No.
Q No?
Who was the first person who contacted you about serving as an expert witness?
A Michael Schaller of the University of Arizona.
Q Okay. Dr. Schaller.
Who was the first attorney that contacted you about serving as an expert witness?
A Alan Purvis.
Q Okay.
And Dr. Schaller had recommended you to Alan Purvis. Is that your understanding?
A I don't know if it worked exactly that way. But Michael Schaller was the first person who asked me if I would be interested
in doing this kind of research.
Q So he spoke to you before Alan Purvis did?
A Yes.
Q When was that?
A I believe it's roughly 1999.
Q Okay.
A I could be off by a year, but I think so.
Would you mind if I got some water?
Q No. That's fine.

31In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A Thank you.
MR. BIGGER: We'll go off.
(Off the record.)
THE WITNESS: Ready.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q How many cases have you worked on in California?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Right.
In how many cases in California have you served as an expert witness on behalf of a tobacco company?
A I believe three formal cases.
Q Okay.
Where you were -- were these cases in which you were deposed?
A I believe I was deposed in all three.
Q Okay.
Were there other cases in which you weren't deposed but you provided services to a tobacco company?
MS. LINDSAY: I'm going to object to form, and I don't think when she's a consultant that's discoverable information.
So I would caution the witness on that. If she's been identified and disclosed it's absolutely fair game. If she's a consultant, I
don't think so. I don't think that's admissible evidence.
MR. BIGGER: The number of times or whether she's been disclosed whether she's been retained and the number of times. I'm
not going to go any further than that.
MS. LINDSAY: Okay.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Have you been retained previously to provide services where you weren't deposed or where you did not provide trial
testimony?
A Yes.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
32In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q How many cases have you provided those what we'll call consulting services?
MS. CHUANG: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm afraid that would have to be a guess because I'd have to go back to my records to review to really give
you the right number.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Give me your best guess sitting here today.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, again, this would just be a guess. I don't know. Five, six. Something like that.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Less than ten?
A I would think so, yes.
Q Okay. Were any of those cases Florida cases?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I should say --
A I'm sorry.
Q Are any of those cases Florida cases in the sense that looking at the list that you provided briefly, I believe all of those cases
are cases in which you've actually been disclosed as an expert witness.
A I'm not sure if I've been disclosed in all of those cases as an expert witness. As I said before, I don't know.
Q Okay. Okay. We'll move on.
So, coming back to the original basis for this line of questioning, this last statement on Exhibit 4 is that your involvement as an
expert witness in Florida litigation has averaged approximately ten percent of your time. That's limited to the Florida litigation.
Expanding that to the California cases that you've been involved in and the two New York cases we discussed, how much of
your time total can you approximate has been involved serving as an expert witness in tobacco-related litigation?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that this guesstimate, which is what it is, would be about the same. If wouldn't vary a lot.
Because, for example, this -- your sentence it seems to me pertains to work over the past five years.

So, when you're not working on one, you might be working on another. But it wouldn't go up because, once you stop working
on one, then you're not working on that and you're working on the next one. If that's clear.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
So you feel like ten percent is a pretty good number across the board from all the cases that you've worked on?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: On average.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay. I'll just briefly go through this while I'm here.
What other sources of income do you have, then, that constitutes the balance, the other 90 percent of your professional activities?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: The primary source of income is employment for the State of California as a professor at San Diego State
University.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I see you have a few books listed on your resume that you have authored.
A (Witness nodded head.)
Q Is that a source of income?
A Yes, it is.
Q There was a book that was listed as forthcoming. It's still not published. Is that still forthcoming, it hasn't been published yet?
A That's correct.
Q What's the name of that one?
A It's tentatively titled “Spinning Planet:
A Short History of the World.”
Q Okay.
Anything else that you do to derive income throughout the year?

MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What else?
A Sometimes I give talks, and I'll be compensated with honorariums for that.
Q Presentations?
A Presentations.
Q Or lectures?
A Lectures.
Q Okay.
Are those listed on your CV that you provided today?
A Probably most of them would be.
Q Okay.
A Sometimes you forget one and don't add it. It should be pretty representative.
Q I noticed that your the reason I asked that is I noticed that your service as a testifying expert for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Company is not listed on your CV.
So I'm making sure that -- are there other sources of income that aren't listed on your CV that you receive in a year, in an
average year?
A I answered something else I had in mind. I'm trying to remember what it was.
This isn't the one I was thinking of. I can't remember which one it was. But, for example, I give cruise lectures. There the
compensation is in kind because I get the cruise for free. So I work and they compensate me in that way.
Q Okay.
A And there is another source of compensation. I just -- oh, yes, editorial boards. Sometimes you're -- it's not even when you're
on an editorial board.
But, for example, press might contact you and say, “We will pay you an honorarium if you'll review a book and criticize it for
its accuracy or its contribution to the literature,” and then you'll get paid for that.
And then there's journalism, too. I do write occasionally for journalistic publications, like the Los Angeles Times, or the
Washington Independent, and I'll be compensated for that.

35In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q I've read your articles for the L.A. Times.
A Oh, thank you.
Q Well, they're on your CV. So I can't say that it was that difficult to find them. But it's good writing.
Do you charge $250 per hour for lectures and that sort of thing? Or how is your compensation set?
A It will vary quite widely how it's set. For a lecture, for example, typically someone who wants you to give a lecture will
contact you and say, “We are prepared to offer you a thousand dollars. Would you come give a lecture?” And in that case, if
I can do it, I will say yes.
So, typically, they set the price for an honorarium based on their budget.
Q Is there anything else that you do for compensation which you charge $250 an hour for?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: The cruise lectures actually are if you figured it out would probably be very might be close to that. But I,
frankly, have never done the math on them. So it would be hard for me to be sure.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
And 250 an hour is what you charge for your services as an expert witness in this and other tobacco-related cases?
A Yes.
Q And that's the same whether you're reviewing research, having your deposition taken or testifying at trial?
A It's the same flat fee.
Q Okay.
Question 10 on this Notice of Deposition asks for copies of all time records reflecting the time you spent on this case.
A Yes.
Q Do you have that with you today?
A I do. This would be the record of my Florida research pertaining to this case.
Q Okay.
This is the record of the time you spent on the Patterson case?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
36In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A This would include some records that pertain solely to Patterson and some which pertain more broadly to research in Florida,
which is necessary to understand -- was necessary to understand Florence Patterson's life story.
Q Okay.
Does any of the time that you have invoiced Jones Day include research done for the Engle Progeny cases generally or for
your work in the Florida cases generally?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q And by that I mean how do you bill for research that would be applicable to multiple cases that you're working on?
A I would bill just the way that you're looking at so that, for example, the first date on there -- you've got it so I don't have
it in front of me. But I believe it's 2007.
Is that correct?
Q January 15th, 2007.
A Okay. Great.
So that was before I had ever heard of Florence Patterson. So, therefore, I was researching Florida in general. But, of course,
it's deeply pertinent to her as well.
Q And the first case that you work on, then -- excuse me. Strike that.
The other cases that follow this first case, the Patterson case, for example, they get the benefit of the research that you've already
done for the Patterson case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, I just I don't know how to quite answer that. I can say that, yes, anything I learn about Florida generally,
the history of Florida, the history of knowledge about the the hazards of smoking in that state will certainly apply to later cases
as well.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q For example, your reliance list in Patterson, which is Exhibit 3 in this deposition, contains scores of articles from the Tampa
Tribune, St. Pete Times, Miami Herald.
You're not going to conduct that research again for later Florida cases, are you?
A I hope not.
Q Okay.

So cases that come later will have the benefit of your research you've already conducted into public awareness in Florida during
the relevant time periods for these cases?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Correct?
A Yes. And that's especially true because for a historian the universe of information you bring becomes richer and richer every
time so that hopefully you get more knowledgeable in general. And that applies to all everything you worked on.
Q Those who do not know the past are doomed to repeat it or something like that?
A I've heard that.
MR. BIGGER: We'll have this marked as 6.
(Whereupon Exhibit 6 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Have you ever been reimbursed or have you been paid for all these invoices that we have marked as Exhibit 6?
A No.
Q Have you been paid for any of them?
A Yes.
Q Okay. So you have some time yet that remains to be paid?
A Correct.
Q Do you know how much money you have made cumulatively from your services as an expert witness in tobacco litigation?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Over what period of time?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q The entire time you've been doing it from 1999 until today.
A No. I'm sorry I can't tell you that. I could research it, but I don't have that information with me.
Q Okay. Don't know it off the top of your head?
A No, I don't.

38In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Are there any other items that you have brought there that we have not talked about in going through this Exhibit A?
A Yes, there are.
Q What else have you brought?
A Okay. For example, I brought some notes that I typewrote about Florence Patterson, weaving together some of the information
from depositions with the universe of facts I have on Florida and on New York.
Q Are these different from the handwritten notes you've already provided me?
A Yes, they are.
Q Does it incorporate some of the information that's in your handwritten notes?
A Yes, it does.
Q Is it fair to say that this typed document you just handed me is something that you were able to generate after performing
your research and reviewing your handwritten notes as sort of a more detailed report on Florence Patterson?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I wouldn't use the word report --
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
A -- because they were only for myself.
And it's not also not intended to be a complete or comprehensive description of the case. It's things that occur to me that I want
to make sure that I write down so that I don't, you know, forget some key element of the case.
Q Okay.
MR. BIGGER: I'll have this be 7. Mark this as Exhibit 7.
(Whereupon Exhibit 7 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Anything else that you brought that we haven't discussed?
A Yes. One final well, one other thing is some notes that I have on Florida in a more general sense that pertain to the research
I've been doing for a few years now.
Q Okay.

MR. BIGGER: This document is entitled “Florida Chronology.”
(Whereupon Exhibit 8 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q And this is something that you produced or developed since you started doing your research on these Florida cases?
A Yes.
Q You didn't have this previously?
A No.
Q Prior to becoming involved in these Florida cases, had you ever done research on the subject of public awareness of the
health effects of smoking in Florida?
A Yes.
Q Was that research that was done by virtue of your involvement in the California and New York cases?
A No.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Sorry.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q That's okay.
When had you done that research previously? By “that research,” I mean research on the public awareness of smoking and
health within Florida.
A Let me make this plain. It wasn't targeted at Florida. But I'm interested in broader questions of reform so that for example,
a book I worked on called “Major Problems in American History,” I have some things on smoking in that book. So they don't
pertain to these cases directly.
Is that clear?
Q Yes. Why don't we jump into that right now, actually.
That book that you authored, “Major Problems in American History Since 1865” -- is that correct?
A That's correct.
Q That's the title?
A Mm-hmm.

40In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q There were two editions of it?
A That's correct.
Q And was or is the subject of public awareness of the health effects of smoking addressed in either edition?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Was it addressed in both editions?
A Yes.
Q In what way is it addressed?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It is addressed in that in particular -- I believe it's the chapter on progressivism, which is a major period in
American history, there's quite a bit of discussion about progressive reformers, and progressive reformers were interested in
such things as the dangers of smoking.
Maybe we could take one more question and then take a break?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q That would be fine. We can take a break right now.
A Okay. Great. Thank you.
(Recess.)
MR. BIGGER: Back on the record.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I think when we ended we had been discussing the Florida Chronology that you prepared. I had that marked as Exhibit 8,
just so it's on the record.
We were discussing your book that you authored, “Major Problems in American History 1865 to Present.”
And you were saying that the book contains some discussion on public awareness of health effects of smoking under the chapter
dealing or is it chapters -- dealing with progressivism. Is that correct?
A Yes.

41In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Is that just a chapter or was that multiple chapters?
A It's just one chapter.
Q Okay. And the chapter is called progressivism?
A I think I recall that it's just called progressivism.
Q I don't have your book. I haven't read it. So there's no trick questions here.
A My copy is at home so I don't know exactly what title we settled on.
Q Okay.
How much of that chapter was devoted to the subject of public awareness of smoking and health?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, I don't know how you would calculate that.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q How many --
A Like by the number of sentences or the number of words or what do you mean?
Q I guess we can't go pages. Was it more than a page or no?
A Yes.
Q Okay. We don't need to go sentences and words, then.
How many pages do you recall, if you recall, were devoted to the subject of public awareness of the health effects of smoking
in the chapter progressivism in your book “Major Problems in American History 1865 to Present”?
A I'm going to give you a guesstimate. So I would guess six, seven, something like that.
Q How many pages are in the book total? If you know.
A Again, I don't know the number of pages. Sorry.
Q 500, less, more?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know. I would think less.

Q We can get the book and we'll be able to find out. I'm just curious if you know off the top of your head.
A No.
Q It does, otherwise, though, as the title suggests, talk about major problems in American history from 1865 to present?
A That's correct.
Q Do you remember what some of the other chapters are called?
A World War II.
Q Okay. That's a major problem in American history?
A That was a big problem.
Q Anything else? Was there a chapter devoted to the Vietnam war?
A It wasn't solely the Vietnam war, but there's a chapter that's devoted to the 60's and, you know, the Vietnam war is one
part of that.
But, again, I don't remember the precise chapter breakdown off the top.
Q Was it broken down basically by decade or was that not how the book was worked?
A It's broken down by period.
Q Okay.
A And sometimes that will be a decade and sometimes that will be three decades.
Q Or a half a decade?
A Or a half a decade. Right.
Q Okay.
What's the intended audience of that? Is it an undergraduate textbook?
A Yes. It's an undergraduate college textbook. But could also be read by high school students.
Q Do you use it for your classes?
A I don't teach that particular class.
Q Okay.
A I may teach it in the future, in which case I would use that book.

43In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Is that typically for a freshman what we call a survey course?
A Correct.
Q The courses that you teach tend to be more higher level courses?
A That's right.
Q Okay. When I was in college they were called the three and 400 level courses. I don't know if they still use that system or not.
There's a section on your CV that indicates the courses that you've taught. These are courses that you have taught typically or
several times, or are these are any of these courses courses that you've only taught on one occasion?
A Yes.
Q And it stops at 2005. Are there any additional courses that you have taught since 2005 through today --
A Yes.
Q that are not listed on here?
A Yes. I'm sorry. I just -- that part of the CV a little out of date. I guess I didn't notice that it said 2005.
Q That's no problem. I wondered if just the date was inaccurate or if there was actually additional courses.
Let me just make this really quick and easy. Have there been any additional courses that you've taught since 2005 that were on
the subject of public awareness of the health effects of smoking or the addictive nature of cigarettes?
A No.
Q Do any of those courses that you have taught from 1988 to 2005 deal with the public awareness of the health effects of
smoking cigarettes or the addictive nature of smoking cigarettes?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
MR. BIGGER: And I don't mean to make that compound. I'm just trying to make it less than two separate questions.
But in the interest of curing the objection, let me just break it down.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do any of those courses deal with public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
A Yes.
Q Which ones?
A It seems to me most typically that it would come up in the class on the 60's.

44In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q I was guessing that would be one that would be a possibility.
Do any of the other courses deal with the public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
A Well, if I were to teach this American Civilization class again, it would probably come up in there. But I haven't taught
that in a while.
Q Is that something that you've taught previously to 1999?
A Yes.
Q You haven't taught it since --
A Correct.
Q Okay. Since let me finish the question.
You haven't taught it since 1999?
A That's correct.
Q Okay.
MS. LINDSAY: Let him finish his question.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What about the history of the 50's and 60's?
A I have taught that since 1999, if that's what you mean.
Q And is that a subject in which you have discussed or taught the public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
Any of those other courses?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q In any of those other courses did you teach about the public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
A Not that I recall.
Q Okay.

45In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
In the 60's, the course on the 60's, did you teach about the public awareness of the addictive nature of smoking cigarettes?
A I believe that comes up.
Q When you say it comes up, is it something that would appear perhaps in one lecture over the entire course, or is it something
that appears frequently?
A It would appear episodically, not -- you know, not every time for sure it. It would come up occasionally.
Q Do you still have your syllabus for that course, the 60's?
A I do.
Q Have you taught that recently?
A Yes.
Q When was the last time you taught it?
A Last fall, 2008.
MR. BIGGER: Counsel, can we agree to produce a copy of that syllabus? If you want us to do it formally, we can.
MS. LINDSAY: I tell you what. We'll take it under advisement. I'm not sure about relevance. But, yes, we can look at that.
MR. BIGGER: Okay. Let me know. If we need to do a formal notice, we will. No problem.
MS. LINDSAY: Okay.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q The course on the history of the 50's and the 60's, have you taught that since 1999?
A Yes.
Q Have you taught it recently?
A Well, let me explain. It would be a version of the 60's class.
Q Okay.
A So sometimes it's titled a little differently. So it would be virtually the same course. But probably for the sake of space, I
ought to condense and get rid of that have in the future. But it was titled differently when I taught it at a different university.
Q I see. So maybe that was the title at the University of San Diego and now at San Diego State it's called The 60's fees?
A Correct.
Q Okay.

46In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
The syllabus between the two courses would be essentially the same?
A Correct.
Q Okay.
Any of the well, let me just back up.
Other than what we have previously discussed regarding “Major problems in American History,” that book, do any of your
other books talk about the subject of the public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
A The book, which is not yet published, may have some information on that. But it's not completed yet so I can't be sure that
it will have that information.
Q Are you the lone author of Spinning Planet?
A No.
Q It's going to be jointly authored?
A Correct.
Q Who is your co-author or authors?
A The co-author is Ross Dunn, D-U-N-N.
Q Is he a professor at San Diego State?
A Yes. A Professor Emeritus.
Q Okay.
So -- what department are you in at San Diego State University?
A The Department of History.
Q Okay. Is he a leader or does he have a leadership position in the Department of History?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
MR. BIGGER: Let me ask that question again.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Is he perhaps the Chair of the Department of History?
A No, he is not.

47In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Okay.
Has he been a professor of history at San Diego State for some time?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
Was he there when you started working at San Diego State?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
What about “All You Need is Love: The Peace Corps and the Spirit of the 1960's”? Does that book talk about the public
awareness of the health effects of smoking?
A No, I don't believe it comes up.
Q It obviously talks about President Kennedy, who was essentially the impetus behind the Peace Corps.
A Yes, it.
Q He was also the driving force behind the Surgeon General's report of 1964?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not sure if I'd call him the driving force. But he was President at the time, and he appointed that panel.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q It was his Surgeon General?
A That's correct.
Q Okay.
And “The Rich Neighbor Policy: Rockefeller and Kaiser in Brazil,” I'm guessing the subject of public awareness of health
effects of smoking doesn't come up in that book?
A That's a correct guess.
Q Okay. See if we can go a little faster through the newspaper editorials, journal articles and book chapters.
Does anything on your -- you know what? It just occurs to me, and I apologize, that I've been marking on the one that we've
marked as an exhibit.
Is that one clean?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
48In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A I think it is.
Q If we can put the sticker on here and you can hang on to it.
A Okay.
Q And we'll get another copy made, if necessary.
So the newspaper editorials, journal articles and book chapters, did any of those deal with the subject of the health effects of
smoking or the public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't believe that any of these would pertain directly. They're mostly on other topics.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What about the section titled “Conference Papers and Commentary”? There's about not quite two pages of material there.
Do any of those conference papers and commentary deal with the subject of public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
A No, I don't think so.
Q Looking at the next section under book reviews, do any of your book reviews listed under that section deal with -- presumably
deal with books on the public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, here again, these are -- some of these are books on the 60's, and they could have come up in those books,
and I just don't recall it, because some of them I read quite a while ago.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Sitting here today do you recall whether any of these book reviews dealt with the subject of public awareness of the health
effects of smoking?
A I don't think that they did.
Q Under the section entitled “Professional Service,” were any of these I don't want to call them appointments what would you
call, if you'd give these a term? Is there a term I could use that you would understand?
A You could call them appointments.
Q Is appointments okay?
A Yes.
Q Were any of these appointments related to your expertise or your experience with public awareness of the health effects
of smoking?

49In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A The one that seems to me most likely might have overlapped a little bit would have been the very first one.
If you look in the chronology on social issues at University of San Diego. But as you can see the dates well precede my work
-- my research on this subject per se.
Q Okay.
A So that could have come up in those issues. I just don't remember. But social issues, of course, at a campus include things
like tobacco awareness.
Q Of course. I understand what you're saying. We've already gone through your courses taught.
The last two pages on this CV there is a note at the beginning under “Other Professional Experience” that says,
“Before entering graduate school, I worked full-time for over ten years (beginning in high school) as a youth and women's
rights activist. The following reflects some of these experiences.”
Does that note apply to the remaining items on this CV, or are there items on this CV that are after graduate school?
A No. The rest of the CV is the oldest experience that I've had, oldest work experience.
Q That's what I thought. I just wanted to clarify.
Now, the research that you've done for your service as an expert witness in tobacco litigation is not contained on your CV?
A No, it's not.
Q Do you have another CV that you maintain where that information is disclosed?
A No.
Q Okay. So this is your principal CV?
A Correct.
Q Do you ever have any intention to publish on the result of your research that you've done for your service as an expert witness
in the tobacco litigation?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I honestly kind of don't know what you mean. As I mentioned, there is information in my Major Problems
book that pertains to public awareness. So there's that overlap.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I think you said there were five or six or seven pages, as best you can recall, in the Major Problems book.

Based on the volume of information that you have compiled in your reliance list, I was wondering if you ever intend to write
an article or even a book on the public awareness of the health effects of smoking.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't intend that at this point. But I could change my mind later.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you consider the research that you did in your service as an expert witness for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to be
scholarly research?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I consider it scholarly research.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q In other words, you went about the task exactly the same as you would as if you were researching for one of the articles
or books on your CV?
A Yes, I did.
Q Did you use the historical method?
A Yes, I did.
Q And briefly, just for the record, what is your understanding of the historical method? And I say “your understanding” only
because it seems like in social sciences there's many different possible definitions or descriptions of things like historical
method, depending on which book or which encyclopedia or wherever you're getting it from, you could perhaps have a different
description of it.
If I'm asking you what is the historical method, what would you say?
A I would base it upon my readings in historical methodology, and I would describe it as a series of steps that a professional
historian takes when investigating a subject so as to have a consistent approach so as to get reliable results.
How long a description do you want?
Q That's fine. That's perfectly fine.
A I teach it over the course of a semester, so we could really go on a long time.
Q I did see that on your CV.
Coming back to something you said earlier or began talking about earlier is that you were first contacted by Dr. Schaller,
Michael Schaller, from the University of Arizona about serving as an expert witness in tobacco litigation.

51In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Is that correct?
A That I was contacted first by Dr. Schaller?
Q Yes.
A Yes, that's correct.
Q You were aware that Dr. Schaller has and I believe is currently serving as an expert witness in tobacco litigation.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I understand that he continues to be an expert witness.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Serves in the same capacity as you are in the Patterson case?
A Yes. It would be very similar.
Q Did you know that he was, or was he -- at the time he contacted you about serving as an expert witness, was he currently
serving as an expert witness for a tobacco company?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I believe he was at that time serving as an expert witness already.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Did you talk about that?
A Yes.
Q Was this a communication that happened over the telephone, or was this an in-person meeting?
A It was over the telephone.
Q He called you?
A Yes. He called me.
Q How long after he spoke to you did you meet with Alan Purvis?
A I don't recall the specific time period. But a guesstimate would be a week maybe or two.
Q Was your conversation with Alan Purvis, the first conversation, was that on the telephone or was that --

52In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A Yes.
Q I'm sorry. Was that on the telephone?
A Yes, it was.
Q Did you eventually meet with Alan Purvis in person?
A Yes, I did.
Q Did he come to San Diego?
A Yes, he did.
Q At that time were you teaching at the University of San Diego or were you at San Diego State University?
A I was at San Diego State University.
Q You said -- I'm sorry. I apologize.
But as best you can that was 1999, give or take a year?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
When you met with Mr. Purvis -- maybe previously -- did Dr. Schaller ever indicate to you what the nature of your services
would be if you became an expert witness in one of these cases?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not quite sure what you're getting at. But he explained it was a research project.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, what did he explain to you when you had that conversation?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q By “that conversation,” I mean when Dr. Schaller picked up the phone and called you in 1999 or thereabouts.
A Well, again, it was ten years ago. But so I'm not going to remember precisely.
But he asked if I would be interested in conducting research on the hazards of smoking that would then be used in cases involving
-- involving that question.

53In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q What else did he talk about?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What else did you and he talk about during that conversation?
A Oh, well, he told me about Alan Purvis. He said that he had worked -- had done some work on a retainer with Alan Purvis.
So he told me a little bit about him. That's all.
Q When you met with or spoke with Alan Purvis for the first time, what additional did he -- what additional information did
he provide regarding the nature of the services that you would be performing, if any?
A Again, the information was very similar to what Michael Schaller told me. That it was research to try to determine the extent
of public awareness about the hazards of smoking, including addiction and lung cancer and a variety of other diseases, and that
the purpose was to find information that to understand what happened so as to be able to communicate that to a jury.
Q Did you have any -- did you have a hypothesis or a preconceived belief at that time as to what that research would uncover?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think preconceived is kind of a funny word in that respect.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Sure.
A I mean, we talked before about life experience; right?
So you walk in with some life experience about things like the hazard of smoking. As a member of the general public, I was
well aware that it was hazardous. So I walked in with that.
But as a historian you don't you try to put that aside just to find out exactly what happened in a given period of time.
Q So your initial -- did you have an initial -- I guess let me ask this as a broader question.
As a historian do you have sort of a hypothesis that you are either trying to prove or disprove?
In other words, did you come in thinking or with the understanding, the belief, however you want to describe it, that information
was widely disseminated and that the public was fully aware of the health effects of smoking for many decades prior to the 90's?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: You don't come in with that as a research hypothesis. The historical method is to ask a question, and then it's
very important to pursue that in an open-ended and open-minded kind of way, regardless of the subject and regardless even
of your own personal experience of something.

Q What was the question that you initially asked or what was the question you were told to initially ask when you began serving
as an expert witness?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I wasn't told. I was asked if I would be willing to do that, to undertake this research, to which I then
consented.
The question, as I've kind of indicated up to now, has been -- was, rather -- to investigate the extent to which the public was
aware of the hazards of smoking and the point at which perhaps they might have become aware of the hazards of smoking and
the extent to which they understood those hazards in a broad sense.
In other words, not just one particular hazard, like setting your bed on fire if you fall asleep, but the broad universe of hazards
that could be associated with tobacco.
So that's -- that was essentially the scope of the question.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q And who set the scope of that question? You or was that the result of discussions you had with Alan Purvis?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, in some sense it's collaborative in that and only in that if someone asks you to consider a particular
research project, they are coming to you with a research project.
So, therefore, you don't say, “I'm going to go research coffee” if they said “I'd like you to research tea.”
So what he brought to me was the question of what did the public know, when did the public know it.
And then I sat down and figured out what to me would be the reasonable parameters of that project. And so I have to think
it through myself very carefully to make sure that that's what makes sense. Getting a question accurately phrased is a very
important part of the historical method.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Why?
A Because, as I tell students all the time, if you don't know what your precise parameters are, you can be researching for infinity
because everything has some tangent to it.
And so it's very important that you make clear what the parameters are so that you don't either go outside them but also so that
you can be sure that you're comprehensive within them. So the definition of the question is very critical.
Q And in these cases, the tobacco cases, the definition of the question you said was a collaborative effort?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

55In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
THE WITNESS: It's -- it was the -- where the starting point was, was something that someone brought to me and said, “This
is a subject we're interested in researching. We'd like to know what you would find in your research.”
In the same way that, for example, I was approached to write the textbook on world history. So someone came to me with that
idea, and then I have to sit down and think about, all right now, that's the project. How do I how should I define that, how should
I -- what scope is there to it that is the natural scope to the project that's being investigated.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So they came to you and said, “We want to know what the level of public awareness was regarding the health effects of
smoking throughout the previous” what? Decades or centuries?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It was a little bit more open-ended in a way in that there wasn't a specific time limit upon it.
It was simply, you know, “We're curious to know what you would find in your research on this topic broadly,” and that was
kind of the scope of it. It was actually really quite a brief conversation.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q This first conversation?
A Yes.
Q You've obviously had many more conversations since that time; correct?
A That's correct.
Q With I'm speaking with Alan Purvis.
A Many more did you say?
Q Well, have you ever been to Washington, DC where Alan Purvis' office was located?
A Yes, I have.
Q I couldn't say was “was” because I don't know if he's still with Shook, Hardy and Bacon, I don't know if he's in Kansas
City. I have no idea.
I'm saying I think his office at one point was located in Washington DC; correct?
A That's correct.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to the form.
MS. CHUANG: Misstates testimony.
MR. BIGGER: Simply for our purposes for clarification, and that's fine.

56In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q But you did go to Washington, DC to visit his office at one point?
A Yes, I did.
Q Okay. Do you remember when that was?
A It would be around the same time that I began the research. So I'm going to guess 1999. Might have been the year 2000,
actually, before I went there the first time.
Q Why did you go to his office?
A To meet with him to find out more about what they wanted to you know, what they understood about these hazards.
Also, I went there to use the Library of Congress. So it was convenient to meet with them again.
Q Had his office been conducting any research prior to your visits?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: What do you mean?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Had they compiled or maintained any databases of historical information?
A Yes.
Q Do you know where that information came from?
A I know where some of it came from.
Q And by that I don't mean do you know what the source of information was. For example, if it was New York Times articles
that obviously came from the New York times.
But do you know where they obtained that information?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I know where they obtained some of it.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Where did they obtain some of it? The part that you know.
A Right.

57In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Well, for example, I know that they had some materials that Michael Schaller found and collected and that he shared with
that office.
Q So they essentially maintained a database for Dr. Schaller of information that he had obtained and compiled?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't think they maintained a database for Dr. Schaller. I think that he kept all of his own documents. So
I think he shared his information with them.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Maybe it was duplicate?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I was told it was a duplicate.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
What about the other information that they had --
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q -- that you said you don't know where they obtained it?
A Well, I don't -- the things I don't know, I don't know. But I am aware that they received some information from the attorneys
there that had an interest in the subject, like Mr. Purvis had tended to collect things, and he made me aware at times, “Oh, I
found this at a garage sale,” for example.
Q Did Alan Purvis and others in his law firm share that information with you?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Some of it, yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q They made it available to you at least?
A Well, I was in their office and so, you know, he would show me a box of something.
For example, there was something I had read about on my own in a newspaper which was a card game about the hazards of
smoking, and he'd say, “Oh, I have the card game. I found it at a garage sale.”

58In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q What about research? Not card games but research. Did Alan Purvis maintain a database or databases of research information
at his office in Washington, DC?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, again, I assume that they had some research. I personally did not rely upon that research that they had.
But they were very involved in these kinds of cases. So I believe they kept the information about it.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q But you never asked them for any of the research that they had compiled?
A No.
Q And, as you sit here today, has any lawyer or law firm ever provided you with research?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. Not that I recall.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So everything on the reliance list, on Exhibit 3, all 5,301 documents are documents that you personally collected and obtained?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I collected them in various ways, but I collected them.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What are the various ways in which you collected them?
A Well, sometimes I go myself to an archive, like the National Archives, and I'll request documents and I will sit there and go
through the boxes and, you know, physically walk over to the Xerox machine and take a copy, for example.
Q What are the other ways?
A I might have a research assistant who I would ask to do that job for me.
For example, I would say, “I'd like to find articles in Good Housekeeping magazine, and I don't have time to go literally sit
down and do that, so could you go to the collections at San Diego State University of Good Housekeeping magazine and go
through them for me?” So that would happen. That would be another way.
Q What else?
A Another way would be, for example, to contact Michael Schaller, somebody I know who is also working in this and who
has gone to some archives that I don't have time for or my research assistant wouldn't have time for, and I would ask him, you
know, do you -- have you done research, for example, in the Newsday archives.

59In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
And Michael would say “yes” or “no.” And, if it's no, then I have to start making these other plans. You know, backup plans.
And then he would share those with me.
So I would decide what I needed, I would just set upon a course of collecting it, and I could collect it in one of these ways.
Q So information was provided or has been provided by other historians with whom you have a relationship?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Information has been provided -- it's again a -- I'm telling you the specific kinds of information. It sounds
a little broad right there.
For example, yes, if somebody had and I was aware that they had a newspaper or had done some work in it, for example, or
an archive maybe, then I would request it and they would send it.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, let me ask you this: I took the deposition of Dr. Louis Martinez Fernandez. Do you know Dr. Martinez Fernandez?
A No, I do not.
Q He indicated that Dr. Ford, Dr. Lacy Ford, had provided him some information from the Tampa Tribune and St. Pete Times
on research that he had done on those newspapers.
The documents that are contained in your reliance list on the Tampa Tribune -- or from the Tampa Tribune and the St. Pete
Times, are those documents that you personally collected or that you directed a research assistant to collect?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I would -- I looked at some myself, and I would also have gotten some asked a research assistant to do some,
and I believe I actually got some from Lacy Ford, too, because he had done a lot in that newspaper.
Often it's a combination of things because the materials are so voluminous that it's literally not physically possible to go through
every page yourself.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What other historians besides Dr. Schaller and Dr. Ford have you received materials from?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: You mean materials pertaining to public awareness or the hazards of smoking?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Yes.
A Because --

60In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Generally speaking, any questions that I ask about materials for the purposes of this deposition where it relates to your expert
opinions of the public awareness of the health effects of smoking, we can just presume they're going to be limited to materials
related to the public awareness of the health effects or addictive nature of smoking.
A And that's very reasonable, and I wasn't trying to be difficult.
Q Sure.
A It's more that -- I do think it's good for you to know that there would be other kinds of historical research I've done for which
I've also asked for information like this, archival information from other historians.
So historians often share information in this way. So that's why I wanted to be clear about the scope of the question.
Q And by that you're talking about research that you have done not related to your service as an expert witness in tobacco
litigation?
A That's correct.
Q Okay.
For the purposes of these questions, we're keeping it to research that you've done for purposes of tobacco litigation, specifically
research that you've done to compile or create your reliance list in this and other cases. But specifically this case.
A Mm-hmm.
Q What other historians provided you information that is contained upon your reliance list in the Patterson case, other than
Drs. Schaller and Ford?
A The other people who come to mind -- and I could be leaving someone out simply for the reason that this research has taken
place over a ten-year period and so it's kind of easy to forget somebody. I don't do it on purpose.
But offhand I'm thinking of James Kirby Martin, who is a professor in Houston, William Steuck, who is a professor in Georgia.
I want to say -- gosh. There was a professor in Kansas, Greg Black.
Q Was the previous name you mentioned Steuck or Stoop?
A Steuck. S-T-E-U-C-K, I believe.
Q Okay.
A Those are honestly the ones that come to mind offhand. I'd have to think a little bit longer if I can recall who else.
Oh, I think -- there is one who teaches at university -- at the university in San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly. Snetsinger is the last name.
John Snetsinger. S-N-E-T-S-I-N-G-E-R. I'm sorry. I believe there's a Z in there between the T. That's as close as I can get you.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q It will be okay.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
61In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A That's a long name.
Q Anyone else?
A Not that I'm recalling at this moment.
Q Okay.
Have you ever met any of the following individuals and I'm just going to say their names and you can say “yes” or “no.”
Dr. John Burnham?
MS. LINDSAY: I'm just going to object to form to the series of questions because I think it lacks foundation.
Go ahead.
THE WITNESS: No, I've never met a John Burnham.
MR. BIGGER: I'm sorry. How does it lack foundation?
MS. LINDSAY: These are names out of the blue. So I just was noting my objection.
Go right ahead.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I'm going to give you a list of names of people who are historians, whether academically or professionally or whatever
capacity they may be, and just indicate whether you have either met or not met them at any time.
First is Dr. John Burnham, and I believe you said you have not met him.
A No, I have never met him.
Q Professor Fred Carstensen?
A No. His name is not even familiar. John Burnham's name is familiar but ...
MR. BIGGER: I'll give you the spellings on these later on.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Professor John Ettling?
A No.
Q Dr. Richard K. Means?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
62In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A I can't recall if maybe I had a telephone conversation with him at some point. But he's deceased now. And I never did meet
him in person.
Q Professor Robert Sobel? Or Sobel?
A No.
Q Dr. Robert C. Sorensen?
A No.
Q Professor Irwin Unger?
A No.
Q With a U.
And Professor Charles Winick?
A No.
Q Looking at your reliance list briefly -- I will just let you look at the copy that's been marked as Exhibit 3 and I'll look at this
other one from another case. It's essentially the same thing. I'm sorry. Let me qualify that.
The format is exactly the same. But what I want to ask you about is you'll see there are several columns on this list. The top
indicates what each column is and one says “image number.”
Do you see that?
A I do.
Q Are these -- is this list generated from by you? Not from you, by you? Did you create this list, in other words?
A I created it in one sense, which is these are all things that I asked to be put on this list, this type of information. This universe
of information. But I didn't type the list.
Q When you say you asked it to be put on there, how did you ask for it to be put on there?
A I would have a conversation with typically Paul Koethe, in this case, and say, you know, “I would like information from this
group of records, information from that group of records,” that kind of thing.
Q Now, you say “group of records.” Are you referring to the fact that some of these image numbers start with -- well, all of
them start with three letters? You can see some are ACR, some are AFL, and that's just on this first page I'm looking at.
A Mm-hmm.
Q Are you referring to, “I would like the records with ACR to be included”? How would you do it?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
63In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
THE WITNESS: I would not reference them by image number at the beginning of any conversation because I don't keep them
myself in by image number.
I would, for example, say -- to just take this page here we're looking at -- “I think it's important to have some articles from
People magazine and from Time magazine, from Newsweek.”
And then we would generate a list together, talk about a list that would include things from that so that for example, Time
magazine has a hundred articles possibly on the subject. I wouldn't want to try and put all 100 articles because then the list
would be much, much larger.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So who would decide which particular article goes on the list?
A It's ultimately my decision.
Q Would you identify it by the title of the article? For example, would you say, “I want Coffin Nails on the list”?
A Not typically. Sometimes I might. For example, the one -- very next one that follows Coffin Nails is Password. And I would
say, you know, “I definitely want to make sure Password is on this list.”
Q And Password refers to the video clip from the game show Password?
A That's correct.
Q So do you have sort of a -- I don't know what the right word is -- a general understanding of these documents such that you
can simply say, “I would like Password to be on there or Coffin Nails to be on there” and that's how it's done in telephone
conversations?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I guess what I'm asking is there are 5,301 documents on here.
Is this something that has -- when you first started becoming an expert witness in tobacco litigation, you began creating this
reliance list and it has grown over time to now include 5,301 documents, or does it change from case to case and you recreate
it every time?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It's some combination of those things. You know, you don't reinvent the wheel each time.
So there's some things you just remember that you always want to use. And then there are some things which are more specific
to a given plaintiff.
For example, a New York -- a New Yorker who lived all their entire life in New York, I might not put much about Florida on
here. So it does change, and that's the effort.

64In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q If somebody --
A That's why it takes so long --
MS. LINDSAY: I'm so sorry to interrupt you. I just noticed that it was afternoon, and I assume you have a series of questions
on the reliance list. So how long do you think -- because I don't want to interrupt you during that.
MR. BIGGER: We'll go a little bit more and then break for lunch and then come back and go into the reliance list.
MS. LINDSAY: Okay. Ten minutes? Does that work for you?
MR. BIGGER: Yes.
MS. LINDSAY: Okay. Great. Again, sorry to interrupt.
MR. BIGGER: If I'm in the middle of something, I'm not going to stop at exactly ten but approximately --
MS. LINDSAY: That was my concern. I didn't want you to get too deep in if you were going.
MR. BIGGER: We can always come back to it. That will be fine.
MS. LINDSAY: Okay.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You mentioned there at the end that if somebody lived all their life in New York, it's more important to have those New York
materials on where presumably there was a chance that they were exposed to those materials.
Is that fair?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
MS. CHUANG: Object.
THE WITNESS: The point is that if you're creating a history that overlaps with a life story of an individual, that there are certain
kinds of information that are most important to bring forward.
So, if someone grew up in New York, then whether that individual saw that particular piece of information is not as important
as to know that this is the climate -- information climate in which that person was born and lived out his or her life.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Let's just get this out of the way at the front, too, because I think this will be easy for it will apply across to all the other
questions.
But you do not know nor can you know whether Ms. Patterson ever read or saw any of these articles?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
65In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Correct?
A No, I don't think so, in the sense that she didn't reference a particular article, for example. She didn't say, “I read this article
on this day,” et cetera.
However, these would be articles, many of them, that would -- some of them could very likely have been read by her.
Q Right.
A Sometimes, for example, you know she was supposed to have read it. She was -- this is a textbook that she was supposed to
have read in the fourth grade. Here is another textbook she was supposed to have been read in the fifth grade. Here's a textbook
she was supposed to have read in the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth grade.
So I don't know. I can't absolutely swear that she read those books. I know she was supposed to.
Q Well, you can't absolutely swear. It's all inferential; right? It's circumstantial.
These were articles or television clips that were publicly available and so you can make an inference that she more likely than
not or possibly was exposed to them as far as the newspaper articles go or the television clips go; correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: With some of the articles, as you're describing it, it's true that we would know, for example, that she got that
newspaper because someone said it and she said it. And so the connection is not as exactly one to one.
However, as I said, there are some things on the list where, you know, unless somebody was breaking the law, unless multiple
people were breaking the law, then she would have had a book and she was supposed to have read the book.
So in that sense I think it's a little bit stronger -- the connection is a little bit stronger than that implies.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q This isn't a trick question. It's not. But, unless Ms. Patterson says, “I read this article,” the best you can do is infer that she
read it from the fact that either -- as you're saying, she was supposed to because it was a school textbook or because it was
out there, it was in the public domain.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. But you can answer.
THE WITNESS: Yeah, I was going to say that. I think I began by saying I'm I can't know unless she says, “I read a particular
article,” and she didn't say that in her deposition.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Right.

66In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
So, like I said, all these articles that are on your reliance list are -- excuse me -- for none of the articles that are on here do you
know that Ms. Patterson read or saw the article.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think, yeah, with her textbooks it's pretty hard to think that she didn't have it in her hand if the teacher handed
it to her. But I don't know, not having a photograph of her of that occurring and, in that sense, it's circumstantial, as you say.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay. That's all I was trying to establish.
A Mm-hmm.
MR. BIGGER: We'll go ahead and break for lunch now and come back in an hour.
(Lunch recess.)
SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, TUESDAY, JUNE 2, 2009

MR. BIGGER: Back on the record.
CONTINUED EXAMINATION
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I think when we left off we were talking about the reliance list in this case. And I don't remember exactly what we were
talking about so I'm not going to try to continue from there.
A That's okay.
Q We were discussing generally the materials that are in here and how they are obtained by you and collected by you and how
they're provided on this list.
And I think we were talking about the well, this list contains reliance materials from many different sources; correct?
A That's correct.
Q And it contains reliance materials from, for lack of a better way of describing it, many different parts of the country?
A That's correct.
Q Okay.
Is it your all the materials contained on this reliance list are important to form the basis of your opinions.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
67In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Is that true?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. They're all important materials or I wouldn't have put them on there.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay. And you put each one on here on this list?
A Well, it's some collaboration in the sense that, as I said, for example, there would be a very large universe of choices in
relation to for example, like the Tampa Tribune.
And I might have a conversation with, for example, Mr. Koethe and he would say, “Well, here are the ones that seem to us to
pertain particularly to” -- I don't know what. Some considerations that are beyond my knowledge.
And so he might suggest, “You know, you've shared with us all of these articles. We think these 50 will be real important to this
case,” because it has some wrinkle in the case that I don't know about. And I would say, “Okay, well, I'll put those on the list.”
And I get the list, and I look them all over to make sure that the representative character of the selection remains the same,
regardless of the particular ones that were selected.
Q So you have the final authority on what is and is not on this list?
A That's right.
Q This reliance list contains materials from the Tampa Tribune and the St. Pete Times, some of which date back into the 40's
and 50's.
Are you aware where Ms. Patterson was living in the 40's and 50's?
A Yes, I am.
Q Where was she living at that time?
A She was living in -- on Long Island, for the most part, in New York.
Q Do you know when she moved to Florida?
A I think it was 1989.
Q Do you know if she ever lived in West Palm Beach, Florida?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall her mentioning West Palm Beach.

68In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Do you know if she ever lived in Miami?
A I don't think so.
Q Do you know if she lived in Ft. Lauderdale?
A No, I don't believe so.
Sometimes, by the way, you can't know everything because it's not very clear for the verified worksheet, and then you have
to rely upon that and the depositions.
So that an example of that kind of problem which doesn't allow me to give you the absolutely completely correct answer perhaps
is -- this example is that at some point she said she went up to Rhode Island, which seemed inconsistent with other things
that she said; that she went to, for example, high school in Warwick, Rhode Island. I couldn't, however, in a way verify that
for myself based on other documents that she provided. So it's possible she might have lived elsewhere in Florida. I wouldn't
necessarily know.
Q But, as you said, you don't have any reason as you sit here today to think she lived in Miami or Ft. Lauderdale or West
balm peach?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, that's correct.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you know why you included sources from the Palm Beach Post, the Miami Herald and -- I believe it's the Sun-Sentinel
in Ft. Lauderdale -- in this reliance list?
A Yes.
Q Why?
A Because one thing that a historian always does when trying to answer a question of the sort that I posed is to see the context
in which the person lived.
And the context is bigger, for example, normally than that person's neighborhood, perhaps even that person's city.
In a place like Florida there's a fair amount of movement back and forth, you know. She might have had friends who were from
outside. Her children might have lived outside.
And so it's just very helpful to make sure that you're consistently describing the entire climate in which a person lived. And
so contextually I found that very helpful.
Q You testified that you understand Ms. Patterson first moved to Florida in 1989.
A Yes. That's correct.

Q But you believe that newspaper articles from the 1950's, 60's and 70's from the Miami Herald, the Palm Beach Post and the
Sun-Sentinel are important for you to express an opinion on Ms. Patterson's awareness of the health effects of smoking?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do I have that correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Do I think that it's important to have these things on? Yes, I do think it's important to have them on the list.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
Of all the sources that are contained on your list and we talked about this before that you don't know whether Ms. Patterson
has read any of these materials, can we agree that she will have been least likely to have read materials from the Palm Beach
Post, the Sun-Sentinel and the Miami Herald from the 50's, 60's and 70's?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, again, you have to remember my question was what was the public aware of, and she's a part of that
public and she came to live in that community.
So I was interested to know what would have been community knowledge that you could have -- parts of that knowledge would
predate her having coming to the community, but the environment to which she moved would be one where people knew about
the hazards of smoking. So that's something they might have shared with her, had conversation about, is often the case.
And even in the depositions people said, “Oh, well, my neighbor told me this,” or “Everybody I ever worked with mentioned
that.” So that's why it's helpful to know the historical context.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So on that basis, then, all of those conversations and all of those communications would have happened after 1989?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form --
THE WITNESS: Do you mean that --
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q When Ms. Patterson moved to the community.
A Yeah. I think what you're saying is that she would have talked with her neighbors when they became her neighbors, and
that makes sense to me.

70In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q In other words, the knowledge of the community in Miami or Ft. Lauderdale or West Palm Beach, if it has any relevance at
all, would only have relevance once Ms. Patterson was a member of that have community.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think we have to define relevance to what?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I don't understand what that means.
A Okay. Well, I guess I'm trying to follow your question, too.
Q Why don't you include materials from New Jersey or Massachusetts?
MS. LINDSAY: Object.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Communities that were certainly closer to the place where she was living, which was New York?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Those could have been included. Again, we're trying to keep this list manageable for you, for me, for everyone
involved.
It seemed to me to make sense to look at the two places where she lived during some portion of her life. So that -- Massachusetts
wasn't one of those. So New York and Florida seemed to me the logical places to center my research on.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q If you were trying to keep it manageable, wouldn't you want to avoid duplicating items on the list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form?
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So it would make sense to list in multiple -- the same item, the same document or the same video clip in multiple places
in the list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. If -- if it's listed multiply, I would assume that that's a typographical error or something. But, you know,
that sort of thing happens.
The -- by multiple listings perhaps you mean if a news article was the same in one place and it was the same in another place,
and it's the same article, is that what you are referring to?

BY MR. BIGGER:
Q No. I mean like a November 5th, CBS News television clip is listed on -- on DVD 1 and on DVD 2. Is there a reason that
it's put there twice?
A I noticed that once or twice myself, and I don't really quite know why this was set up as it was. I mean, why one thing is on
one DVD and not another DVD. That's kind of a secretarial thing that the -- Jones Day handled. So I don't know why it does
that. But I did see that a couple of times too.
Q But when you reviewed it, you didn't mention that to them and say, “Hey, this is there twice”?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I did not. This particular version of this list May -- as you know, generated very recently, and I am not
fully aware of why it was put in a different format. I did ask.
I heard it had something to do with what your office requested. But beyond that, I really don't know. I mean, it seems to me
a secretarial matter could be cleaned up perhaps.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What did you hear about what my office requested?
A Only that that's why we had it in three different piles. Before, the first list was a continuous list by date, and then this is a
slightly different version. And that's all I heard.
Q And you were told that my office requested it that way?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not entirely sure it was your office per se. But I understood that there was some reason having to do with
a request that the information be placed in a slightly different format.
I don't recall, honestly, if it was your particular office or if it was just maybe even another plaintiff's office.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you understand that since the initial disclosure of your reliance list in September of 2008 when you were listed as an
expert witness in this case there were another 1800 documents that were added to the reliance list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Did you collect all 1800 of those additional documents from September 2008 until May of 2009?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
72In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I didn't collect them all within that period of time. Some of them I would have had already and some of them
I would, yes, have collected since then.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q But between September 2008 and May 22nd, 2009, you directed the law firm of Jones Day to add those items to your reliance
list?
A That's right.
Q Why were those additional 1800 items included?
A Sometimes there were and I have to say I'm not going to remember these 1800 items, so I'm not going to remember all of
the reasons.
Sometimes there might have been a newspaper group we overlooked the first time or something. Sort of like, “Oh, well, let's
make sure we include more from Orlando” or something.
And then I have actually collected more documents, particularly from the Methodist church, for example, because that was
important. Or Baptists. You know, there were various things you would collect.
I think that not all the Catholic Educator in fact, I'm not even sure the Catholic Educator was on the September, because there
are a lot of cases that are being addressed at one time.
So you get your initial list, and then you sort of sit down and get a chance to really work on it in depth a little bit later as
time goes by.
Q You put various Baptist materials in your reliance list for Florence Patterson.
A Yes.
Q Is it your understanding that Florence Patterson ever attended or was a member of the Baptist church?
A I don't believe she was. I know she was raised as a Catholic.
Q Why would various Baptist materials be included to form the basis of your opinions in Florence Patterson's case?
A They would actually be very important, because the Baptists are the largest denomination, I think, in the country, actually,
and certainly in the south.
And so, again, that goes to the context of information that Florence Patterson would have been exposed to. Likely talking with
neighbors, you know, interacting with people who were Baptists.
Q Information she may have been exposed to? You said would have been exposed to.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

73In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you have any basis for the statement that she would have been exposed to those materials, Baptist materials?
A As I said, I think that in the context of the community in which she lived, it's very likely that and, again, I can't be sure as to
the religious affiliation of her neighbors. I don't know. But I think it's good chance that a number of them were Baptists.
And as others said in their depositions, who were people related to Florence Patterson, neighbors and coworkers and people
would talk to them about these things all the time.
She also, of course you know, she had children who lived in that area. Again, they would have been exposed to this information
too.
So I try to think of it as an overall climate in which the person is living. So in that sense I think they're very relevant.
Q If you try to think about it as an overall climate in which they're living and that materials from that climate are important to
be included on there, is there anything you would exclude?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q For example, there were probably Seventh-day Adventists. There are in Florida Seventh-day Adventists.
Did you include materials from the Seventh-day Adventist church?
A I included materials that talked about the Seventh-day Adventist programs. For example, the five-day program to stop
smoking. So that would have been included in there, yes.
Q Is that why you included it, because there's a possibility that Florence Patterson or her neighbors or her children may have
at some point met someone who was associated with the Seventh-day Adventist church?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I included it because, again, this is a part of a larger community, and she might have, you know, walked past
a hospital run by the Seventh-day Adventists or a Sunday school by the Seventh-day Adventists, and they would have literature
sitting out there and she might have picked it up.
So a denomination like that especially, actually, is very important outsized to its numbers in terms of raising public awareness
about the hazards of smoking.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you know how many textbooks you included in your reliance list?
A No. I didn't count them up.
Q Can you give me a rough number?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
74In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I really wouldn't want to do that. I could look at the list and count them, if you like.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q That won't be necessary. I can certainly do that too. I was just curious if you knew off top of your head.
I'll represent to you that it's several pages of textbooks that are included. What was your method for determining whether or
not to include a textbook on your reliance list?
A I researched the textbook authorities and determined what textbooks they were requiring students to read. And then I would
put those on the list.
Q Where? What -- you said that the textbooks they were requiring students to read. Which students?
A Well, for example, Catholic students. That was important, since she was raised as a Catholic and went to a Catholic parochial
school through fifth grade.
So there what I used was the -- a publication documentation called the Catholic Educator from that era that talked about which
parishes adopted which kinds of books.
Q What about the scores of other textbooks that are on here not called the Catholic Educator?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q How did you decide to include those textbooks?
A Can I clarify that the Catholic Educator isn't a textbook?
Q Sure.
A I didn't want you to walk away with that impression.
Other textbooks, another very good example of this would be New York textbooks, and there I went to the state library in Albany
and looked up educational materials they had that would indicate what kinds of textbooks were used and what the choices --
range of choices were for educators in New York, and then I would put some of those on, too.
Again, you have to recall that not only did she grow up there but her children grew up in New York. Some of them grew up in
Florida, and some of them grew up in New York. But so multiple generations of this family were in both places.
Q So the basis for including them is that it's possible that her children were exposed to one or more of these textbooks and
that it is also possible that her children, after being exposed to the material contained in the textbook, had a conversation with
Florence about what they had read?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

75In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Is that a fair statement or -- if I'm not understanding it right, explain it to me. I want -- you're the expert. I want you to tell
me what I'm missing.
A We know from the Surgeon General of the U.S. that one of the ways of the many, many ways that people found out about
the hazards of smoking was that family members would tell them about it.
And in -- we know that with Florence Patterson, her parents told her about that. Did not want her to smoke.
But if you read, for example, the Surgeon General's reports from the mid 80's, roughly, one of the things they talk about is the
extent to which parents are warned by their kids, because the kids learn it from their textbooks or from cartoons or from any
number of ways, and then they go to their parents and tell them about it.
So that's why it seemed actually very important to me to know what Mrs. Patterson's children and grandchildren would have
been reading.
Q And so each of the textbooks that's included on here, you determined that these were the textbooks that her children,
grandchildren had been reading or would have been reading?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It would depend upon the location. In some states there's it's mandated that this is the very specific textbook
you must use, and some other states you're given a choice of textbooks.
So sometimes I could say yes, her granddaughter should be reading this book because that's what Florida says you should be read.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What is it in New York? Do they mandate it or do they give you a list of possible choices?
A In New York it's a district adoption. So it's a list of choices.
Q Do you know what district where Florence's children went to school adopted as their textbook?
A Oh, do I know -- I'm sorry. Say that again?
Q Do you know which textbook was adopted by the district where Florence's children went to school?
A No. What I do know is that there were a range of choices and so, therefore, I look at all the choices, which may account
for why your list is so long.
Q So there could be a lot of textbooks on here that really have nothing to do with this case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. That's not true because --

© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
76In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Well, if the district didn't choose it and it wasn't a textbook that her children were exposed to who then may have told her
about something they read in their textbook, which is already an attenuated connection, assuming it wasn't chosen by the district
and it wasn't a textbook that the children read, what possible basis did that textbook have to this case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: First of all, that's hypothetical. We don't know that they weren't chosen. Some of these books would have
been chosen.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, you don't know what was chosen. That's what I asked you.
A In addition to that, these are books that would have been read by other students, for example, in other parts of New York.
So, if a school has five choices, it makes sense to me as a historian to read all five, not knowing which of the potluck entrees
she might have gotten.
But, again, that goes back to creating the climate of the state that she was living in and the larger community of which she was
a part. The metropolitan area of New York, of course, is very large.
And Mrs. Patterson you also to need remember too worked at a state hospital. So she would have been interacting with people
from all across the state.
So I just -- to me it seems very logical that all five books would be relevant.
Q So you read all of the textbooks that were possibly available for the school systems in New York on the possibility that the
district may have selected that textbook and that children who were educated in that district read that textbook and, even if they
weren't Florence's children, they may have interacted with Florence's children or with Florence?
MS. LINDSAY: I'm going to object to form and --
MR. BIGGER: I'm must trying to follow through.
MS. LINDSAY: I'm sorry. I think we lost -- could you maybe break that down? It's awfully compound.
MR. BIGGER: I'm trying to follow through for her. That's the chain -- it's hard to break down when you have a logical chain
that involves possibilities and possibilities and possibilities. But I will do the best that I can.
MS. LINDSAY: Thanks.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So you read all these textbooks that were possible textbooks that could be included in the educational system in the various
districts in New York.
Do I have that part correct?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
77In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A Yes. I read all the textbooks that are on that list.
Q Okay.
And all these textbooks on this list are the possible textbooks that could have been used by the various districts for educating
children in New York?
A Well, it would vary. You recall that in the time in which she was in Catholic school those would have been exposed largely
well, I can't actually say to just Catholic children, because some of those were the books that were being used across the country
too. So let me take that back. It is a large question.
Q Let me just stop you for a second.
A Which part would you like me to answer?
Q I'm trying to break it down.
This is your you were explaining to me the basis of your opinion on why these textbooks are relevant to this case, and I'm just
trying to make sure I understand it and it's clear for the record; okay?
So I'm not really trying to make it complex. I think the complexities are from the basis of the opinion. I'm trying to break it down.
All these textbooks that are on your list you feel are relevant because all of the these textbooks are the possible textbooks that
could have been used in the education systems in the various districts of New York.
Is that correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q And if you don't understand my question, help me out. I want to explain it in a way that you're explaining it to me.
A Again, it just -- it seems very compound, but I will try.
And I will say that all of these are on there because this is the universe of books, which, of course, is a very small subset of all
the possible textbooks that could have been across assigned across America and anywhere in the English speaking world. These
are a very small subset that were selected by either Catholic authorities or by the state of New York and some of them, of course,
are from the state of Florida as well because she has long life span, and she has grandchildren who are in school now there.
So this small subset of a larger universe, I think they're all relevant because I think they would have been used throughout
the state. And Florence Patterson in her work and in her life would have met people who had been exposed to all of these
varied textbooks.
And so, therefore, it's very -- it's quite relevant to understanding the climate of knowledge and understanding that existed during
the however many years, many decades that she lived there.
Q Okay.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
78In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A And worked there.
Q Let's focus this down a little bit, because we were talking about, what you originally were talking about is that either Florence's
children or other children who Florence may have met through her work at the state hospital system or perhaps who her children
may have met could have been exposed to certain textbooks; okay? Do you understand what I'm saying there?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
So, with that framework in mind, not all of these textbooks but the possible universe of textbooks for the districts of New York
are contained on this reliance list.
Do I have that part right?
A I'm sorry. I did lose you someplace in that.
Q Okay.
You don't know what textbook the districts of New York used. You said you don't know what particular textbook they used.
A That's not quite I don't think fair, because I know that they had a fairly limited list. I assume they had a list because they
wanted people to have choices.
Therefore, educators would have made their choices amongst this small list of books per grade. And so, therefore, it's extremely
likely that all of those books were used.
I cannot tell you which schools used which of the books. The records frankly -- unfortunately, weren't even kept by the districts
because they update their list and then they tend to throw away the old list.
So historians don't always have the luxury of being able to find every document we wish -- we know existed at one time point
in time.
Q Right. My question was: You don't know which books the district used. And the answer to that question was yes.
MS. CHUANG: Objection. Misstates testimony.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
Which book on this list did the district where Florence Patterson's children went to school use as their textbook?
A They used one of those five. I cannot -- five is not even the right word, because we're talking about multiple generations,
multiple schools.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
79In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
But I can tell you that these were books that were included in a fairly narrow list. So I can't tell you the specific list or the
specific book that each generation would have used.
Some books are more commonly used. I could give you what I think is a reasonable historical inference on that.
Q Doctor, I don't want to cut you off and I'm not -- this is not a trick question. I'm trying to make this as simple as possible.
It's just getting complicated. It doesn't need to be that way.
You don't know which book was used by the district where Florence Patterson's children were educated; correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. I think that mischaracterizes. She's been trying to explain.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You can answer.
A Yes. I think -- I think that does -- I will -- unfortunately, I'll probably have to repeat what I just said to you and then you'll
feel like it doesn't -- it doesn't help you.
I don't know a specific book.
Q Right. That's what I'm telling --
A I know the universe of books.
Q Exactly. You know the possible choices. You don't know which book it was, though.
And so you included all the possible choices on this list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form, and I'm going to ask that you please let her finish her answer.
Go ahead.
THE WITNESS: Right. I don't know the specific book. But one thing I do know is that all of the books warned students about
the hazards of tobacco, about the problems of addiction, possibility, probability even of addiction, about, you know, being
careful what you use, taking responsibility for your health.
So, even if I don't know -- and I can't know, as I've told you I think I'm answering your question I can't know the specific book,
but I can tell you that of the choices they had, all of these choices tell the kids the same thing in one way or another, because
that's what they're mandated to do by law.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So is it your opinion, then, that there were no textbooks that existed at that time that didn't warn children that tobacco was
hazardous?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

Q Were there any textbooks that did not warn children that tobacco was hazardous?
A Any textbooks where?
Q Anywhere.
A In the world?
MS. LINDSAY: Object --
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q How about anywhere in New York?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: On the state list?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Yes.
A I don't believe so. I have not come across any that were. That did not inform children of the hazards.
Q Okay.
I don't want to keep going back through this. I'm just honestly trying to make this --
A Shall we try to do it again?
Q No. I don't want to try to do it again. I just want to try to make it clear that -- what I'm trying to make clear is that this is
based not on well, strike that.
You don't know which textbooks her children read; correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. It's been asked and answered.
MR. BIGGER: It hasn't.
MS. LINDSAY: And she explained it. Please go ahead.
THE WITNESS: I don't know which ones they read. I know which ones -- I know the ones they had to select from.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
A I know that all of them gave the same message. That seems to me important to say.

Q Okay. And so -- that's fine. That's fine. We'll move past it.
Needless to say, your reliance list includes materials which you have -- which you don't that anyone involved in this case read
or was exposed to.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think where we might have a disagreement is about being exposed to. I think they were exposed to these
materials.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So Florence -- Florence Patterson, it's your opinion, was exposed in some way or another to all the materials on this reliance
list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: My research findings suggest to me that she would have been exposed in the sense that this was the community
of which she was a part. And, even if she didn't read a particular document, because I can't tell you which of these she herself
read --
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q If any.
A If any. She may never -- she may not -- I mean, she didn't tell me whether she knew how to read. I think she did. I mean,
I think she must have. Goes through school. I'm inferring that. I'm inferring all of these things: That she was educated, that
she paid attention when she was in school.
And that if she didn't read these, that her neighbors would have read them or more distant people in the state of New York and
that she -- this would have created a climate, a broad public awareness of the hazards of smoking, and in that sense she was
exposed by proxy, if you will, to all of these materials.
Q It's like what we said earlier. It's inferential or circumstantial.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I'm not quite sure how you mean those particular words, like circumstantial, because I'm sort of
aware that that might have a legal meaning that I hesitate to comment upon.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I'm simply saying your basis is that you're calling it the community, I'm saying the circumstances.
It's simply by the fact that she was alive and walking around in New York, and somebody who lives in New York probably
read something on this list and maybe there was a conversation that they had. That's circumstantial.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

82In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
MS. CHUANG: Is that a question?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q That's the basis for the inclusion of some of the materials that are on this list is because through her circumstances she may
have encountered someone who was exposed or who did read the materials that are on this list?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think we're going over the same ground.
But I can reiterate that, yes, some of the materials are on there because I think that it created a climate of knowledge amongst
the public.
Some of these I think it's very, very doubtful she ever would have read. In fact, some of them are from the 19th century, for
example. I can't imagine she, not being a historian, would read those things.
So in that sense, yes, it's knowledge that's inherited in a way, that you absorb almost by osmosis.
For example, some I've read articles by where people will say, “Anybody who can read or hear knows that smoking is bad
for you.”
That's not saying you've read a particular document. It's just saying this is something that's passed down from general to
generation. So, even if you haven't read what your parents read, in a way you get it through your parents.
So her parents might have read textbooks that she never read, she wouldn't read, because school districts turn over textbooks
every five to six years.
But those older textbooks are, in fact, quite relevant because how people learn things is through a variety of ways. And sometimes
they don't even know exactly how or at what moment or from what document they learned something. But the fact is that they
did learn it.
I mean, in the same way you can say you could be out in the rain and you don't know which raindrop hit you but you know
you're all wet.
So I think she grew up in a climate where so many people knew this information through so many sources, some of which are
on this list, that she perhaps probably would not have read herself.
But they would have educated all of the people around her so that it would have been very difficult for her to have lived out
her life and not known.

Q If somebody held an umbrella over your head when it was raining, would it be harder to tell if it was raining?
A I think that starts to get very metaphorical and hypothetical here. Usually you do know it's raining if you're outside.
Q Fair enough. You would be --

A Even inside. You might not even be under an umbrella. You'd be under a roof.
Q You wouldn't be getting hit by raindrops.
A Not if you're indoors.
Q Under an umbrella?
A Your feet would get wet.
Q Okay. You win. You got me there.
MS. CHUANG: Side rain?

Q Did you include any advertisements in these reliance materials?
A Yes.
Q I saw you included some reliance materials on smoking cessation programs.
Did you include any other advertisements in these materials?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What other advertisements did you include?
A For example, the Reader's Digest advertised consistently in almost every newspaper on the list.
Q I'm sorry?
A The Reader's Digest advertised for its publication and often identified why somebody would want to read it, which would
-- they would advertise that they were -- they had some article on smoking, and it might appear, for example, in the Newsday
that Florence Patterson got.
Q Did you include any advertisements that were run by the tobacco companies?
A No. I don't think there were any tobacco advertisements on that list.
Q Did you make a specific decision to exclude them?
A I have them in the universe of things I've got. As I told you, I have many, many more documents that are on that list.

84In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
But in the sense that I didn't think that they were necessary to be put on this list, yes, I excluded them.
Q So you felt it was more important to put advertisements for smoking cessation programs, for example, that ran in Newsday
than to include advertisements for various tobacco products?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, you recall that my question was what do people know about the hazards of smoking.
So an advertisement, for example, from the Reader's Digest which says, “Smoking is really bad for you. Come read about in
this month's issue” would be very important to put in there so as to show how people came to know this information.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What about an advertisement from R.J. Reynolds or not R.J. Reynolds an advertisement for Camel cigarettes that they're
the mildest cigarette available?
A What about it?
Q You don't think that's important to inform the public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
A I don't think that it is. I don't think that the public looked for health information to commercial advertisers. I think that they
are much more likely to have looked to newspapers and governments and churches and schools and that kind of thing.
Q So you think that a 10, 11 -- 10-year-old person is more likely to look to a newspaper article than a tobacco advertisement?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q A tobacco company advertisement?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I'm just -- I mean, is that your opinion or --
A Well, my opinion is that children even as young as you're describing had textbooks and heard church sermons on the
importance of not taking advertising at face value, any kind of commercial advertising.
So even a child by that age, age 10, would have -- if they wanted to know about the health consequences of something, would
have looked to people who sat them down in health class and said, “This is what you need to know, and one of the things you
ought to know in addition is that advertising is self-interested, and you should be looking for information to your parents or
to your teachers or to the government.”
Q Did you that they heard church sermons that people should not look to advertising?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I'm sorry. I didn't get that part of it. I thought you said something about church sermons and advertising.
A In various denominations -- for example, the Methodists, to take an example, had publications aimed at youth and, yes,
sometimes they would say be wary of advertising on other subjects as well, like alcohol.
And they would say you should really, this is not where you should be looking for information.
So I guess I'm inferring that if they put it in their publications, they probably put it in the sermon. They could well have done so.
But even if a person didn't hear it vocalized, they could have read it in the publications aimed at their age group.
Q Do you know if Florence Patterson ever attended a Methodist church sermon?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I don't know if she ever attended a Methodist service.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
A But, of course, in her community there would have been Methodists.
Q Who heard that they should not trust advertising and who may have told Florence Patterson not to trust advertising?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q We don't need to go down that road.
A Okay.
Q That's fine. But I'm following it to its logical conclusion.
I notice you don't have the Frank Statement in your reliance materials. Do you know what I'm referring to when I say “the
Frank Statement”?
A I know what you mean.
Q Okay.
A I honestly thought it was in there.
Q Is it in here?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
86In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A I think it is.
Q You believe that it is?
A I thought it was. But, as you said, this is 5,000 items so it may have fallen off.
Q Do we agree that --
A One more possible permutation of the typing.
Q Do we agree that the Frank Statement was important to informing the public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think it was one of the things that talked about health possible health consequences from smoking. So, yes,
I would include it on the list.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Wasn't it the it was a statement by all the tobacco companies collectively that they accept a responsibility in the health of
their smokers?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you recall that the statement said that?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, I'd have to look at the exact statement if you want me to restate what it said.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Sure.
(Whereupon Exhibit 9 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I'm handing you what we've marked Exhibit 9. This is the “Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers.”
Do you know how many newspapers this publication appeared in?
A I don't recall the number.
Q If it was over 400 would you have any reason to disagree with me?
A I just don't remember the number so I'd hate to agree or disagree.

Q It appeared as a full-page advertisement in many major publications, many major newspapers. Are you aware of that?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm aware that it appeared in newspapers.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Are you aware that it appeared in many newspapers as a full-page ad?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that I recall that it was a full-page ad. But -- again, I've seen it but -- and quite a number of times. I
don't remember the exact size, in different newspapers.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Not in all newspapers, but in many it did appear as a full-page advertisement. I'll represent that to you. If you can't recall.
Do you see in the left column I think it's the second full paragraph near the bottom, if we call that a paragraph. It starts,
“We accept an interest in people's health as a basic responsibility, paramount to every other consideration in our business.”
A Yes, I see that.
Q Does that refresh your memory about the statement contained in here that the companies accepted a responsibility in the
health of their smokers?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It refreshes my memory as to the exact wording of that statement in there.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you see the next sentence down?
A Yes, I do.
Q Would you read that for the record?
A “We believe the products we make are not injurious to health.”
Q When a product manufacturer in a full-page advertisement in a major newspaper states that they believe that their product is
not injurious to health, do you think that that affects public awareness of whether that product is injurious to health?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Do you mean hypothetically any product, anytime, anywhere, under any circumstances?

BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Let's just keep it to the products that are at issue in this case.
A Okay.
Q Do you think that affected the public's awareness of the health effects of cigarettes?
A No, I do not.
Q Do you have a basis for that belief?
A Yes, I do.
Q What's that?
A One reason would be that this is -- was one advertisement in multiple newspapers on one day in 1954.
I have to butt that up against the other universe of things that people would have been looking at, because all of us, I believe,
are influenced on multiple levels by different kinds of things.
So that to give you just a tiny example of that, Ann Landers was reproduced almost every day for 50 years in 1200 newspapers
or more. Again, I can't remember the exact number. It was 1200 or 1800. Anyway, more than 1,000 newspapers every day
for 50 years.
And she was renowned, as was her sister, Abigail Van Buren, for repeatedly saying the same thing, which is that cigarettes are
very dangerous, they're very addictive, you shouldn't use them, they may give you lung cancer, et cetera.
So I put something like this in the context in which I say, all right, people hear lots of different things. What do they hear
the most? What do they hear the most frequently? Which sources are they likely to think are the most credible based on what
they've been told?
So, yes, the statement is here. It says exactly what it says, but I don't think that it undermined public awareness at all of the
hazards of smoking.
Q Do you think there was ever a controversy about whether cigarettes were injurious to health?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So it's your opinion there was never a controversy?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No.

89In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So in 1940 the public was fully aware that cigarettes were injurious to health?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think the public was aware in 1940 just as they had been aware in 1920, as they had been aware in 1898,
or something, when one of the -- the correct answer to a question in a Florida -- I believe it was either Florida or New York --
but a children's textbook in that year was what is -- what is smoker's cancer. That was the question in the textbook, to which
the answer was supposed to be lip, throat or tongue cancer.
So, yes, I think the public has been fully aware for multiple generations that cigarette smoking is hazardous or that use of
tobacco in general is hazardous.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I was going to say, because the modern cigarette hadn't really even been invented yet. So it would be hard to know that
cigarettes were injurious to health at that time.
A Well, that's why I corrected myself to say tobacco.
Q Okay.
The Frank Statement may be in here or not. I'm not going to argue about it. It is or it isn't. There's a lot of materials in here,
and I could have missed it.
One thing that is in here, though, is something from the Seattle Daily Times in 1973, “A Frank Discussion About the Limitations
of Bathroom Tissue.”
Why is that important to your opinion that Florence Patterson was aware of the dangers of smoking?
A You know, we'd have to pull up that article to look at it because I don't remember every line in every one of those articles,
as you can expect.
Q Well, just from the title of it, can you tell from the title of it what possible relevance it could have to Florence Patterson's
awareness of the health effects of smoking?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q The title again is “A Frank Discussion About the Limitations of Bathroom Tissue,” and it's in the Seattle Daily Times, which
I believe is a publication in Seattle, Washington.
Do you know if Ms. Patterson ever lived in Seattle, Washington?
A No, she wasn't, that I'm aware of, in Seattle, Washington. But, of course, there are several questions contained in your
statement it seems.

90In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
But as to title, I think that one thing which is actually quite interesting about this subject is the way in which information about
the hazards of smoking, use tobacco in any form, are embedded in lots of things you wouldn't expect.
And -- so that, for example, even if somebody decided they're just really not interested in ever reading anything about tobacco
because they just don't want to, they might read about toilet tissue and, by golly, it will come up.
Again, I'd have to see the article to know why you know, to recall to myself why what was in that particular article.
But you see that a lot, lots articles on that. For example, Dear Abby, you know, will often have a headline which doesn't pertain
to smoking, but the third letter she receives will be about smoking.
Q So you can't just read the headlines?
A As a historian, I wouldn't want to just read the headlines.
Q You actually need to read the article itself?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Read the article for what purpose?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, you were just indicating that a person needs to read more than just the title of the article to determine whether it has
information that would affect their awareness of the health effects of smoking.
A Well, I
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. I think that mischaracterizes your testimony.
THE WITNESS: Okay.
MS. LINDSAY: I'm sorry.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You can answer. That's fine.
A I don't think a person would want to do that, have to do that.
I'm saying that I as a historian have found that this information occurs in a lot of unusual, unexpected places. So I would look
beyond the headlines. Routinely look beyond the headlines.
You know, believe it or not, kind of an odd little side bar here is that toilet paper can be about health. So sometimes I'll find
something and I'll read, oh, toilet paper. Huh. I wonder if this has to do with things related to the body. If it relates to the body,
then sometimes, not always, there's a reference that will be relevant.

Q So you're sticking to your guns? A 1973 article from the Seattle Daily Times called “A Frank Discussion about the Limitations
of Bathroom Tissue” is relevant to Florence Patterson's awareness of the health effects of smoking?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
MS. CHUANG: And I'll move to strike that beginning comment.
MR. BIGGER: I'm not going to designate that. But, I mean, she just did a side note on the health effects of bathroom tissue.
I think it's -- I didn't move to strike that.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Anyway, you're sticking to the point this is relevant to her awareness?
A It is relevant.
Q And that's why it's in here?
A That's right.
Q Okay. Just making sure.
A Yes.
Q It's an odd one to have in here, but I was just making sure.
A We might be heading towards a bathroom break at some point.
MR. BIGGER: That's fine. Let's take a break.
(Recess.)
MR. BIGGER: Back on the record.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q We've been using the term “awareness” a lot today. Your disclosure actually uses the term common knowledge. I think it
also uses the word awareness.
In your opinion, is there a difference between awareness and knowledge, or are they used interchangeably by you?
A They can be interchangeable, but one could make a subtle difference a distinction between them. Use of language.
Q How do you use them? Interchangeably or is there a distinction?
A Mostly I'd say I probably use them nearly interchangeably.
Q Okay.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
92In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Like, for example, in your disclosure which is -- I have a copy of it here. It's right here.
A Okay.
Q In the section subject matter of expert testimony, you said that -- excuse me -- the disclosure says that you are expected to
testify about the widespread public knowledge.
A Mm-hmm.
Q So, in your mind, the use of knowledge there is interchangeable with awareness as we've been using it today?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
Does that knowledge or awareness require a belief that the -- let me think of a better way to say that. Sorry. It's not coming
out right.
Can you have public knowledge or awareness of something that you believe isn't true?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Can someone have public knowledge or awareness of something they believe isn't true?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
It's still kind of vague and overbroad. I'm sorry. Can you --
MR. BIGGER: That's fine.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Go ahead and answer.
A Brings to mind Superman.
Q What does that mean?
A We all know about Superman. At least pretty much most people know about Superman. But we don't believe he exists.
Q So, we're aware of the fictitious character Superman, but we don't believe there is a real superman outside of the literary
or film version?
A Well, I don't.
Q And by “literary” I include DC Comics in that. Maybe you don't --

93In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A I would.
Q -- since you're a more experienced literary person. But using the broadest sense of the word.
So what about extraterrestrial life? Can someone or do you believe there is public awareness about the existence of life anywhere
other than Earth?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, not to pun, but that seemed a little pretty far afield going off the Earth itself.
However, I think probably I haven't studied this. But I'm aware that many people have had reference -- made references to ET,
for example, or, you know, the possibility that scientists are always interested that maybe someday we'll communicate with
other planets. So, yeah. It's out there.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Area 51 or UFO's? There's a lot of information out there in the public domain about, for lack of a better generic term,
extraterrestrials.
Do you agree with that or not?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It's really not in the scope of my research.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
Could there be public awareness or public knowledge of the existence of extraterrestrial life without the public believing that
there really is life somewhere else other than on Earth?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I kind of don't get what you're driving at.
I mean, yes, people can know about things that maybe are fictional or unproven, like the existence of extraterrestrial life. But
I'm not sure how it pertains to this research.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q We'll use your Superman analogy.
A Okay.
Q Do you believe there is public awareness of Superman?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
94In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A I would not want to testify as an expert really on Superman, but I know there are a lot of people who know about Superman,
yes. That's why I brought it up as an example.
Q Okay.
A Common cartoon character.
Q Okay.
A But obviously cartoon.
Q Right. Fictitious.
A Yes. Fictitious.
Q So it's your opinion you can have public awareness of something that is -- well, it's your opinion you can have public awareness
of something that is not true or that people don't necessarily believe to be true?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. People are aware of literary creations all the time.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q All right. Well, I believe a literary creation is a bad analogy. I'll see if I can think of a better analogy. But in the meantime
we'll come back to Earth.
A Very nice.
Q So when The Gallup Organization is taking polls of the American public -- let's back up a step.
Do you know who The Gallup Organization is?
A Yes.
Q Do you think The Gallup Organization is a reliable source of information on public opinion?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that they are considered a very reliable polling agency. So, yes, if that's what you mean, yes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Polling is typically done to gauge public opinion. Would you agree with that?
A That's right. They're called public opinion polls.
Q Right.
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
95In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
So it's fair to say, then, taking it to the next step what you said, that The Gallup Organization is a reliable source of information
on the public opinion at the time the poll was taken.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I would see it as being one piece of evidence. There would be others, of course.
So in the case where I would look at polls, I would always look at in the context of everything else that was in the public
domain that people were talking about or being exposed to or that might reflect public opinion, for example, like -- going back
to literature briefly. That would be an example of reflecting what people think and know, too.
So, yes, Gallup would be a reliable indicator and one of the indicators.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Are you an expert on polling or do you hold yourself out as an expert on polling?
A I don't hold myself out to be a pollster. For example, meaning somebody who is qualified to conduct polls. However, in my
research I certainly consult polls.
Q Okay. That doesn't exactly answer my question.
Are you going to be providing any expert opinions in this case on polling, polling data or the use of polls?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I will be providing information, as is evidenced on the list, of materials I provided about polls and what they
can tell us, what they can contribute to our knowledge of what the public knew about the hazards of smoking.
So, in that sense, I will be using polls, as any historian would, about a topic. But I don't consider myself an expert in polling
as a scientific discipline.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you consider yourself an expert in statistics?
A Definitely not.
Q What about epidemiology?
A No. Again, I'm not an epidemiologist.
But one of the things that actually is I think very nice about the discipline I am in is that it draws upon all of the disciplines so
that when we look at a society we are able to use some of the tools and some of the information that's, for example, developed
by anthropologists or archeologists or polling scientists or medical scientists.
So, for example, I present information here written by doctors, but I'm not a doctor. But as a historian I think it's perfectly
reasonable -- in fact, essential for me to include that kind of information.

Q Would you agree that lung cancer is the most closely associated risk of smoking cigarettes?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
MR. BIGGER: Let me state that a different way.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Lung cancer is a risk that is most commonly associated with smoking cigarettes. Is that fair to say?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No, not necessarily.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay. Why not?
A Well, for example, addiction is the hazard that is the oldest known hazard of smoking, and it's very, very common too. So
I don't think I could say, you know, reliably that lung cancer is the most commonly understood risk. There's a set risks. It's
one of the better known ones.
Q If there are internal tobacco company documents that indicate that smoking public is not aware of the addictiveness of the
product, would you disagree with those documents?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Because you just said that addictiveness was the most commonly known risk, and it has been, I believe you said, for many
years.
Would you disagree with those internal company documents that indicate otherwise?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, you know, I'd obviously have to see the documents to say whether I agreed or disagreed with them.
I certainly do disagree, however, that -- if I saw a document that said nobody knows that it's addictive, I would say I don't
think that document accurately reflects the reality, because the addictiveness of it is very, very -- has been known since the
15th century.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q When you say “addictiveness,” are you using the term as you did in your disclosure, to be the equivalent of habit forming
and difficult to quit?
A That --

97In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I put those in a series because they're the words and phrases that have been used over a long period of time
to describe it. Describe the property in tobacco that makes people want to use it repetitively.
So in that sense, yes, I'm putting them together because I think that they are parallel terms.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you they're equivalent.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q For example, in the Surgeon General's report in 1964 they used the word habit instead of addiction. But in your mind that
means the same thing?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I am trying to relate to you what I've seen historically rather than something in my mind, not being a medical
expert, not --
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Excuse me. You're right. In your opinion. In your opinion, habit and addiction, they are interchangeable?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, it's really not my opinion that I would like to state here. It's what I've seen the public -- how the public
and even doctors have characterized it over a long period of time.
I can't really weigh in on whether I think that these should be equivalent or ought to be equivalent. They simply have been used
equivalently in the period of time I looked at.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Categorically they have been used equivalently?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Only over time.
For example, in some period of time people would be more likely to use the word addictive. Another period of time people
might be more likely to use the word habit forming or slavery to describe the same property.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q And it's your opinion that the use of the term “habit forming” in literature means or meant the same thing as “addictive”?

98In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. I don't think that's her testimony.
MR. BIGGER: That's what I'm trying to figure out.
THE WITNESS: Well, when the Surgeon General in 1964 put in “habit forming,” they were referring to the same property
as the Surgeon General's report of 1988 which used the word “addictive” to describe the same chemicals and the same effect
upon people.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, are you aware of --
A Words go in and out of fashion, so to speak.
Q Are you aware of the Reader's Digest article that compares quitting smoking as a habit being no different than the habit of
wearing clothes?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yeah, you'd have to show me that particular article. I've read, I believe, all of the Reader's Digest articles.
But I just don't remember that phrase.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Are you aware if that's in your reliance list?
A Is that particular article with that particular phrase? I don't know. As I said, you'd have to show me the article. Then I could
look back and see whether it was one I included or not.
Obviously, I can't remember every phrase from every one of thousands of documents.
Q Are you familiar with The Roper Organization?
A Yes, I am.
Q You're aware that they also are a polling organization?
A Yes, I'm aware of that.
Q Do you believe them to be a reliable source of information regarding public opinion?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that they would be very similar to The Gallup Organization and considered one of the better polling
-- more reputable polling companies in America.
MR. BIGGER: I'm going to have this marked as 10. It already has a 13 written on it. I'm sorry. I don't know why it has that on
there. But it's in folder 15, so that doesn't make any sense at all. But nonetheless.

THE WITNESS: Taking it on faith.
MR. BIGGER: That's right.
(Whereupon Exhibit 10 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q This is document 10. This is a poll from The Roper Organization that was commissioned by The Tobacco Institute.
Do you see that on the title page?
A Yes, I do.
Q In July of 1982?
A Yes, I do.
Q What is your understanding of The Tobacco Institute?
A The Tobacco Institute was an organization that represented did some research, I believe, for the tobacco industry. I think it
might have been originally the TIRC. Changed its name over time. But I honestly haven't studied their particular history closely
so I don't want to swear on that.
Q Are you aware that they also were involved in lobbying for the tobacco industry?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall whether they were also a lobbying group.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Are you aware of whether they were involved in public relations for the tobacco industry?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, I just remember them as being an industry-organized institute that could have those various things.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
If you'll turn to page -- it's 31 in the upper left-hand corner.
A Okay.
MS. LINDSAY: For clarification, is this an excerpt from that poll?

100In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
MR. BIGGER: Yes. It's not the entire I think the poll itself is 100 -- 150 pages or something.
MS. LINDSAY: I just wanted to make sure we were clear about that. Thank you.
MR. BIGGER: It is an excerpt from that poll.
THE WITNESS: Yeah, I can see that.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So on page 31 -- do you see there at the bottom?
A Uh huh.
Q It says,
“As of 1978, smokers consider smoking to be only a habit ... rather than an addiction ...”
A Mm-hmm.
Q Do you agree that there seems to be a distinction drawn here between habit and addiction in this poll?
A Yes, at this time there was this distinction being made. At least Roper says it was being made.
Q But in your opinion there typically wasn't such a distinction made in the sense that habit and addiction were equivalent?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: People can use something interchangeably and not say that they are exactly the same thing. That's why we
have the sources, because there are a lot of words to say the same thing.
In this case I'm going to guess this is 1978. So I'm going to infer here that because it's in '78 people might have been aware of
the Surgeon General's report of '64, pretty near in time, which called it not an addiction but habit forming.
Ten years later a different Surgeon General called it an addiction, changing the definition -- the medical definition of addiction.
And so it's possible that and, again, that's one of the problems with polls and why you can't use them alone, because I do know
that -- at least I've always heard that when a poll is taken, depending on how the question is worded, you might get a different
answer, even if you're asking -- intending to ask the very same question.
So in this case I would put it in the universe of information I have, which is that probably it's likely the same people who said
habit forming might on another occasion use the term addiction and mean the very same thing, but when pressed on the fine
distinction might say, well, habit forming.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Are you an expert on addiction?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

101In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
THE WITNESS: I'm not a doctor. I'm not so, definitely not a biologist or somebody who would understand how -- the chemical
processes.
But, of course, I have read quite a bit. For example, even in the records of the Surgeon General in Washington, DC in the
National Archive the records of the original Surgeon General's committee that devised the 1964 report, and they have a couple
of files on addiction. So I read those files.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you understand that an addiction is typically something that results in a diagnosis?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm not aware of that, how that's used.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You're not aware of the criteria for diagnosing addiction?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, I am.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What criteria are you aware of?
A Well --
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: there are many criteria and, as I indicated, at different times -- points in time different criteria are applied.
And I've seen that.
I've seen conversations and, you know, read in the public -- even in the newspaper, something in the Tampa Tribune I was just
looking at yesterday about addiction and the use of the term addiction.
So I couldn't -- I can't tell you how doctors use it at a given time or how they would diagnose it.
I do know that diagnosis has changed, and I could tell you something about that change.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You could tell us something about that change from the historical use of the word. Is that what you're saying?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

102In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
THE WITNESS: I can tell you about how people -- what conversations they had about the word and the use of the word in
the 1960's, for example, or in the 1980's.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q But you're not giving an expert opinion on addiction in these cases, are you?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, that seems very broad. I've tried to tell you the ways in which I would be able to testify about addiction.
This is how it's been understood. This is how the term was used historically.
I, however, will not endeavor to because I have not researched even at all the physical properties of addiction, for example, or
the prognosis for people who are addicted. I don't know that information.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q But you are going to give an expert opinion on the fact that addiction and habit have been used interchangeably throughout
the literature that you reviewed?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I will be testifying as to public awareness of the hazard of addiction, using it in the term that it was used in
every century, actually, I looked at.
Sometimes people would also call it habit forming. And so I will be able to testify to that knowledge of the hazard that's involved
in smoking, which is that you may become addicted or you may develop a very bad habit.
And different people say the essentially, the same thing and sometimes the same people use the same thing. Use the same word.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So, if I was in the habit of always putting my left sock on before my right sock, would you say that I was addicting to putting
my left sock on before my right sock?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I wouldn't be trying to diagnose an addiction in any case. So, you know, I could really make no statement
about that.
People who have obsessive-compulsive disorder -- I'm inferring now, not that I'm a doctor that knows about that. But sometimes
somebody is very strongly habituated to do something in a certain order.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q In your opinion, habit and addiction are used interchangeably throughout the literature that you reviewed, and that's the
opinion you'll be expressing in these cases and in this Patterson case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

103In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
THE WITNESS: I really don't mean to be difficult. Please tell me one more time question?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q In your opinion, habit and addiction have been used interchangeably throughout the literature you've reviewed.
And so for purposes of this case, the Patterson case, it's your opinion that the use of the two phrases is interchangeable and,
therefore -- for example, like in this poll where 52 percent of the smokers said smoking is a habit and 25 percent said it was
an addiction, those two words are essentially interchangeable?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think you had one question and then you phrased a second one. I will answer no to the first question.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q They're not interchangeable?
A Yes, I will not say that in all circumstances they've been used interchangeably because that would not be accurate.
Q Okay.
So on your disclosure, then, where you indicate that it may be habit forming, addictive and difficult for some people to quit, are
there different points in time where the public was aware that it was habit forming versus the period of time when the public
was aware that it was addictive?
A Well, let me try to explain.
In 1988 the Surgeon General published reports saying that tobacco was addictive and disputing the use of the term habit forming
that had been used by his predecessor in 1964.
So that's a good example of how a person makes a big point of saying that they're not interchangeable, even though people
commonly interchange the two words.
He wanted to say that they're not interchangeable and that, in fact, we need to understand addiction as being something different
from something that's merely habit forming.
Q And that's the opinion you plan to express in these cases?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I -- the thing I just said is something I would be prepared to demonstrate at trial.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
For something to be common knowledge, does it have to be widespread?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
104In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A It seems to me that common roughly means widespread, yes.
Q So, in a given population, would the majority of the people have to know or be aware of something in order for it to be
common knowledge or common awareness?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
Common knowledge or common awareness is obviously different for different populations. Would you agree with that?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't -- I don't know what you mean.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, you'd have to look at the particular population that the person was in to determine whether there was common knowledge
or common awareness.
For example, do you believe you could compare the common knowledge or common awareness of nonsmokers with common
knowledge or common awareness of smokers?
A I would certainly compare -- I would put them all in a general pool of Americans who would have been exposed to the same
information. So there would be common awareness amongst these two groups.
Q So, in your opinion, there should be no distinction drawn between the common knowledge or common awareness amongst
a group of smokers relative to the common knowledge or common awareness amongst a group of nonsmokers?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I sort of feel that's almost too hypothetical because we -- you know, it would be helpful to know specifically
what you're driving at, honestly.
(Whereupon Exhibit 11 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I'm handing you a document that we've marked Exhibit 11. This is an excerpt of a poll done by The Gallup Organization.
You can see the title of it is “Trends in Public Attitudes on the Possibility of a Health Hazard in Cigarette Smoking” and it's
dated March 1964.
A I'm sorry. Where is the date on that?
Q It's you see the stamp confidential? It is --
A Oh, it's stamped over it.

105In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Right. This is a poll that was commissioned by one of the tobacco companies. They privately commissioned The Gallup
Organization to conduct this poll.
You can see in the introduction, which is, I think, the fourth page in there --
A Mm-hmm.
Q -- it has the objective of the study.
A Okay. Yes.
Q It indicates that,
“The objective of this study was to measure, among a sample of the national adult civilian population 21 years and older, trends
in attitudes concerning the possibility of a health hazard in cigarette smoking.”
Do you know if this poll is contained in your reliance materials?
A I don't remember. I don't think so.
Q Do you know if any of the polls that were commissioned by the tobacco companies are contained in your reliance materials?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It's possible there's an overlap but I'm unaware. The poles that I took generally were the ones that were in the
public domain that, for example, were available from The Gallup Organization.
So, if something was commissioned secretly, then I probably wouldn't have it anywhere.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Did you ever ask the companies for any research that they had done on the public awareness of the health effects of smoking?
A I've had no communication with the companies.
Q Well, did you ask the attorneys from Jones Day for any research that the companies have done on the public awareness of
the health effects of smoking?
A No, because I didn't think it pertained to my research.
Q Why not?
A Because they would be reflective of as you said, they're internal documents. They would be reflective of what the company
was saying to each other or what they were to pollsters, et cetera.
What I'm really interested in is what the public had access to, since that's what I considered Florence Patterson to be a member
of, not a member, obviously, of a, you know, tobacco company. I would want to know the kinds of things she and her circle
of -- that she lived in would be exposed to.

106In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Maybe you're confused on what I'm saying.
The tobacco companies commissioned The Gallup Organization and The Roper Organization to conduct polls of the national
population regarding their awareness or their knowledge of various things associated with smoking cigarettes.
A Mm-hmm.
Q One of them was the public's awareness of the health effects of smoking cigarettes, which is the objective of this poll.
So, based on that understanding, that this is a poll done of the national population, do you still feel that this poll is in some
way skewed?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
MS. CHUANG: Object to form and lack of foundation.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Not skewed.
I'm just trying to understand why you wouldn't ask the --
A Well, I just --
Q Hold on one second. I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to understand why you wouldn't ask the -- for polling that was done that maybe doesn't exist out there for you to
get on your own independently but that you could have access to that would further reflect what the level of public awareness
was at that time.
A Well --
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: You may be aware that there are lots of polls available that do help me to understand what people were talking
about at the time and thinking at the time.
So -- The Gallup Organization, for example, ran a regular column on their polls, and I -- and regularly reported on the subjects
that we're talking about.
So I didn't feel a need to go find out if internally there were other organizations which would have also conducted polls or that
Gallup might have conducted polls for.
So I really felt I had plenty of evidence just using what was out there and available to me or anybody else.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.

107In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
So you didn't feel that you needed any more information?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Is that what you're saying and that's why you didn't ask for any research the companies had done?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
So why didn't you ask for any of the research that the companies had done prior to retaining you as an expert witness?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: What research they had done internally is not related at all to my finding out what the public saw.
In fact, they're almost opposed in the sense that I'm not interested in what people were saying to each other internally or polling
about.
I'm really wanting to know what an average person like Florence Patterson could have possibly been exposed to, and The Gallup
Organization -- and Roper to a lesser extent but Gallup has a lot of information on polls that they've conducted concerning
tobacco for more than 50, 60, 70 years. So those were polls I did look at. I just didn't feel it was necessary.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Let me read the objective of this study again and maybe you just don't understand what the objective was of this poll.
“The objective of this study was to measure, among a sample of the national adult civilian population 21 years and older, trends
in attitudes concerning the possibility of a health hazard in cigarette smoking.”
So this is a poll that was conducted of the national adult civilian population 21 years and older.
Are you aware if there was another Gallup poll that was conducted in 1964 that you rely on in your opinions in this case?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't recall if there was a particular 1964 poll. But I've seen polls from the 50's and from the 60's and from
the 70's, from the 80's from Gallup and other groups. So I didn't think I needed yet another poll.
I don't -- and I may have even seen this poll. I just don't recall offhand. But it was something I went out of my way to find
because there were lots of other polls available.

108In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
But I asked similar questions, from what I can tell just looking at that objective you reiterated. You read out loud.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q And you have not at any time asked for any of the internal research that was done by the companies on the public awareness
of the health effects of smoking cigarettes?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Is that correct?
A I have not asked the companies for any internal documents, including those that pertained to polls like this one.
Q Or any other research that was done on the public awareness of the health effects of smoking cigarettes?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think I answered that question. I don't know how is there some different -- something differently you're
asking me?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, you just limited your answer to polls.
I'm just saying you haven't asked for any other research done by the companies on the public awareness of the health effects
of smoking cigarettes.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Is that correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It's correct that I haven't asked the companies for any of their research.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q On the public awareness of the health effects of --
A On the public awareness.
Q Okay.
If you'll look at the Bates number at the bottom is 01140992.

109In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A Okay.
Q And the question that was asked in this poll is,
“What is your opinion -- do you think cigarette smoking is or is not one of the causes of cancer of the lung?”
And the results printed there are, “Yes, it is one of the causes,” and they have broken it down amongst all adults as a percentage
and amongst current cigarette smokers.
A Mm-hmm.
Q And you can see that there's a discrepancy amongst all adults and cigarette smokers as to the percentage of people who think
that cigarette smoking is or is not one of the causes of cancer to the lung.
Do you think that the distinction is significant between the cigarette smokers and all adults?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
MS. CHUANG: I was going to say objection, lack of foundation. I don't think you established that she's seen this before. Have
you asked her?
MR. BIGGER: I think she's established she's never seen this before because she's never asked for it.
MS. CHUANG: So it's a document that she hasn't seen that you're asking her about?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What I'm asking about is that we were discussing whether it's important to look at the level of awareness amongst a particular
population in which a person is based on their circumstances.
For example, we talked about previously it's important to know that you didn't include the public awareness of Arkansas in
these materials because there was no reason to believe that Ms. Patterson was ever exposed to anything in Arkansas.
Do you remember talking about that, that you included materials in here from Palm Beach and Ft. Lauderdale and Miami
because it's important for the context that she could have been exposed to those populations of people who were exposed to
that material? Do you recall the previous testimony in that --
A I recall having a conversation about that, yes.
Q Okay.
Likewise, is it important when you're assessing the public awareness to look at the population the person is in and the awareness
of that population?
In other words, not just all the people in the country, but the awareness, level of awareness, amongst smokers.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

110In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q Is that an important distinction to make --
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q -- in your opinion?
A This is fairly hypothetical. Yes and no.
For example, I might look at the books that all fourth graders have read. There's not a big chance that fourth graders have
started smoking yet. I'm sure there are some fourth graders who have, mind you, but it would be pretty small compared to
eighth graders or something.
So in this case taking just this poll we would know that current cigarette smokers and all adults would all have been in the
fourth grade, probably, anyway. Very likely to have all attended fourth grade.
So there, that wouldn't be a particularly important distinction to know about those two people if you were looking at what
awareness and what information people get from their educational background.
You know, it's certainly of interest here, and you see that, you know, the columns are different and the number is smaller under
the column related to -- under the column of current cigarette smokers than the column all adults.
Q Well, for example, if you look at June of 1963, which is before the Surgeon General's report came out in 1964 --
A Right.
Q -- which was obviously, everyone agrees, a major news events, 53 percent of all adults according to this poll think that cigarette
smoking is one of the causes of cancer of the lung. Only 44 percent of cigarette smokers believe that it is one of the causes.
A Yes. But keep in mind that we -- again, I'm not a polling expert, but even I can see that there are different ways of reading
that question.
You might think it's the cause. So, if you don't think it's one of the causes, if you think it's the cause, then you might answer
no to this question.
That's why -- and I don't know. I'm just saying there are a variety of inferences that one could draw from this question.
And so it would be important to look at them both, and it would be important to look at other polls around them and also other
information around them and the ways that they had reacted under different circumstances.
So it's significant, but I can't tell you its precise significance other than as one piece of the information that tells us that people
were thinking about this topic and were aware that these things had been linked.
Do they think there's biological proof yet? That's a different question from do they think they've been warned about it, do they
remember Hammond and Horn warning about it. Those are all relevant considerations.

Q Regardless of your critique of the question that someone who thought it was the cause may not have answered yes, it is one
of the causes, 44 percent of cigarette smokers in this national poll did not believe cigarette smoking was one of the causes of
cancer of the lung. Agree?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I can just read to you what it says there. I don't know what all of the poll was about. So it's kind of hard to know.
But certainly in this column what it's showing is that the current smokers, that number is lower than all adults.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q And since 44 percent of the people who were cigarette smokers in June have 1963 believed that it was one of the causes, 56
percent of the cigarette smokers in June of 1963 did not believe that smoking was -- cigarette smoking was one of the causes
of cancer of the lung.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: All we know is that in this one poll they answered the question this way, where if they were asked a different
question such as, “Are you aware that the Surgeon General has warned people that smoking is a cause of cancer,” it might
have a very high number.
So I can tell you you're absolutely right, that's what it says there on the paper. Do I think this means that cigarette smokers did
not realize that there was a strong link between these two things? No, I wouldn't say that. I think they did know.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q And it's your opinion from what we talked about earlier as well that if the Surgeon General had warned people that it was
a cause but they didn't believe it, they didn't believe it to be true, that it was a cause of cancer, that they still were aware of
the health hazards of smoking cigarettes.
Is that correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: That's a pretty long sentence there.
So I -- maybe you could pare it down or give me one thing to answer rather than several parts of it. Yes, I think that they were
aware that smoking was hazardous.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Even if they didn't believe it to be true, they were still aware?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: They may have thought it wasn't hazardous to them. Often people think that something won't happen to them.

Q Cognitive dissonance? That's the term for it? Are you familiar with that term?
A Well, optimism bias. There are lots of terms that are related to the fact that humans do risky things, and it's hard to explain why.
Q Cognitive dissonance is a psychological term that's associated with people not wanting to believe that bad things will happen
to them that are happening to others.
Are you familiar with that term, cognitive dissonance?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes, although I've heard it used in slightly different ways. In fact, a number of ways.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You're familiar with the principle, though?
A Yes.
Q And that's one of the reasons that you believe that people may be aware of the hazards but not believe it to be true?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, actually, there I think that you're asking me to go into an area that I can't give an expert opinion on,
which is the psychology of cognitive dissonance or any of those terms, because I really know them more from a lay person's
point of view.
I'm not sure why people would do this, but I do know they were warned. And they were aware of the warnings.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well okay.
Information was out there? You are aware of that fact, that there was information available?

Q When did television begin gaining mainstream popularity in households across the United States?
A Well, a very tiny percentage owned TV's at the beginning of the 50's, and 80-something percent owned them by the end of
the 1950's. So if would be occur over the course of that decade.
Q Throughout the 50's?
A Yeah, throughout the 50's.
Q Is that a subject that you discuss in your class on the history of the 50's and 60's?
A Yes.
Q The rise of television?
A That's right.
Q TV dinners sitting in front of the TV?
A Only if you're forced to.
Q Not a TV watcher?
A Not a TV dinner eater.
Q Not a TV dinner eater. Fair enough. I can't fault you for that. Me neither.
Would you agree that television became important as a medium for communication in the 50's and 60's?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Say that again?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Would you agree that television became important as a medium of communication of information in the 50's and 60's?
A Yes, I would agree with that.
Q Would you agree that it became very important?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I would say it became important. There are other that are also important and perhaps equally important sources
of information.

Q Do you know what the average number of hours per day would be of the typical American household watching television
in, let's say, the late 50's?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No, I don't know that figure.
(Whereupon Exhibit 12 was marked for identification, a copy of which is attached hereto.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I'm handing you what we marked Exhibit 12. This is a document you probably have never seen before because it's an internal
-- a Lorillard company document. The title is “P. Lorillard Company Network Television Review 1962.”
And if you look at -- it's Bates numbered 04413150.
A 4413150?
Q Yes.
A Okay.
Q The title of that page is “Average Viewing Hours Per Home Per Day.” Is that the document you're looking at?
A Mm-hmm.
Q And you see at the bottom the source of this information is from the A.C. Nielsen company?
A Yes.
Q Are you aware who the A.C. Nielsen company is?
MS. LINDSAY: I'm going to object to form because I don't believe we've established she's ever seen this document either.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Have you ever seen this document?
A No, not that I recall.
Q I didn't think so.
MS. CHUANG: I'm going to state an objection, a continuing objection, to questions about documents that she's never seen
before.
MR. BIGGER: Okay.

Q You see at the bottom of that page Bates 04413150?
A Yes. The page we were just speaking of?
Q Yes.
A Yes.
Q Again, the source of that information on that page is from the A.C. Nielsen company.
A Yes.
Q And I believe you indicated that you were familiar with the A.C. Nielsen company?
A I'm not familiar with the company, but I've heard Nielsen ratings.
Q Okay. That's the company.
Do you know whether the A.C. Nielsen company is a reliable source of information regarding television ratings and, by
necessity, the television viewing hours of American households?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know if they're the place to go to find that out per se, but I do know that they know a lot about television
and about what people watch.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You're familiar --
A That's why they talk about ratings.
Q Is it your understanding that they're essentially an expert in television ratings, or is that your general understanding?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: That would be my lay person's understanding.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Right.
A I couldn't attest to that as an expert certainly.
Q That's fine.
A And, as I noted, I have never seen this document. So it's on the fly.

Q And you have not had any experience with the A.C. Nielsen company in the course of your historical research into tobacco
litigation, have you?
A Yes, I have.
Q You have?
A I've come across Nielsen ratings on shows, for example, to know whether or not a show was very popular. So that would
be relevant at time times.
Q Have you included any of that information in your reliance list?
A I don't think there's a document on there from the Nielsen ratings. It might be included in the subset sometimes on articles
on -- on a popular television show it will say the Nielsen company says this is the top show. So it would work in. Possibly
would be embedded, I think.
Q And you you did include some television clips in your reliance materials.
Do you know if you included any television clips from any television shows that were sponsored by the tobacco companies?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to the form.
THE WITNESS: I don't know.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Let me back up a step.
Are you aware that many television shows in the 50's and 60's were sponsored by tobacco companies?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I would have to -- we'd have to talk about what “many” meanings. I'm aware that some were.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, let's jump ahead a couple pages and come back.
A Okay.
Q You know what? Let's wait. Let's clean out this page first.
So you see here the average viewing hours per home per day as provided by the A.C. Nielsen company in, for example, 1959
was six hours.
A Yes. 1959. I see that.
Q Do you have any reason to disagree with that?
© 2016 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.
117In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: To be honest, the chart doesn't look very good to me.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q But the hours that are provided from the A.C. Neilsen company in 1959, do you have any reason to disagree that that was
accurate, that the average viewing hours per home per day was six?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Because other parts of this page don't look reliable to me, I would then -- it would make me wonder about
this one, too. Were I to do research on the Nielsen company and on this document, I would want to dig a little deeper.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What about the chart doesn't look reliable to you?
A Well, it says the first block there you see under 1951 it says the average hours of television viewed per day per home was
about almost five and a half hours. Five hours and 29 minutes.
But television was, as I understood it, only in less than five percent of homes in 1951. Again, that's not I'm speaking generally,
but I'm pretty sure it's close to that.
So how could -- if only five percent of the people had TV's, how could the average viewing time in each home be five and
a half hours? It doesn't sound right.
So that figure doesn't sound right so that tends to make me feel a little bit more suspicious of the second figure.
Q Okay. Anything else?
A That's all that jumps out at me.
Q Okay. Looking ahead at 04413163. So about 13 pages ahead.
A 163. Okay.
Q Further ahead.
A I have that.
Q At the bottom there it says,
“Source: LNA - BAR.”
A Yes, I see that.
Q Are you familiar with those acronyms?

118In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A No, I'm not.
Q Okay.
The title of the page is “Number of Evening Programs Sponsored by Cigarette Companies November to December Each Year
1955 to 1961.”
A Mm-hmm.
Q And do you see there in 1957 approximately 26 percent of evening television programs were being sponsored by cigarette
companies?
A I see that there's a block that's 1957, and at the top it reads “31” and under that 26 percent.
Q Right. So approximately a quarter of the evening television programs were being sponsored by cigarette companies in 1957?
MS. CHUANG: Object to form.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you see that in this document?
A I see this chart that you're telling me about.
Q Right. Sure. And I understand. I'm just asking if you see that information stated there.
A I see exactly what it says. I'm not entirely sure what it means.
Q Okay.
Do you see in 1961 that number has risen to 45 percent --
A Uh-huh, I do.
Q of evening programs sponsored by cigarette companies?
A Yes, I do.
Q So not quite half of the evening television programs at that time were being sponsored by cigarette companies?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: That's what it says there.

Q Do you recall or have you come across in the course of your historical research the -- some of the well-known programs that
were sponsored by cigarette companies at that time in 1961?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm aware of advertising on television, but I'm not aware -- I have not researched per se which shows would
have been sponsored and which shows were not. I've heard that, but I have not made a study of it.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You don't hold yourself out to be an expert on advertising, do you?
A I think this would fall under the category of kind of the question about polling. I'm not an advertiser. I don't design advertising.
I don't make that the focus of my research, for example.
But, as a historian, advertising is very often a part of what I do. In the class on the history of the 1960's, for example, we talk
quite a bit about advertising as a historical subject.
Q So, as far as the history of advertising, its growth and development, you feel you are an expert on that subject?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: My specialty is not advertising. So I wouldn't -- couldn't give an expert opinion about the internal workings
of that industry, for example, or what advertisers are seeking in trying to set things up in different ways.
But I certainly talk about advertising and have considered advertising, both in this historical subject and in other historical
subjects I've looked at.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, did you include any of the television programs that were sponsored by tobacco companies in your reliance materials?
A Here's my problem. I think I might have, but I'm just not certain, because advertisers bounce around.
Sometimes a program might be sponsored or -- you know, like, “Here's a word from our sponsor,” and you'll see an ad, and
then maybe a year later somebody else will be a sponsor.
So when a company decides to run an ad during a program may vary quite a bit. So I have not made any effort to track down
which programs were sponsored by a particular company for a particular period of time. I am aware that there was advertising
on television until 1971.
Q Well, what about like the I Love Lucy show? Are you aware that the I Love Lucy show was sponsored by tobacco companies?
MS. CHUANG: Objection.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I have watched I Love Lucy myself and --

Q Reruns on TV today?
A Reruns on TV today, reruns in the 60's and 70's.
Q They've taken the sponsors out now.
A Well, I know. But I'm just saying --
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: do I am I aware I'm sure there was a time when they were I'm not sure. But I think I have heard there was a
time when one of the advertisers on that show, perhaps the sponsor of the show even, was a cigarette company.
I also know that many, many times the show has aired without them being a sponsor.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Have you or are you aware that during the 1950's I Love Lucy was, if not the most popular television, one of the most popular
television shows at that time?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I'm aware that I Love Lucy is an iconic show.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Are you aware --
MS. LINDSAY: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Can we take a break soon?
MR. BIGGER: In a few minutes.
THE WITNESS: Thanks.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Are you aware that I Love Lucy was one of the most popular shows during the 1950's?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

Q And perhaps even into the 1960's.
A You know --
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

121In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
THE WITNESS: -- I think that this in a way goes outside my expertise only in the sense that you're asking me to make a
comparison with the - let's say ratings of other shows as well.
It's a very well-remembered show, like Leave it to Beaver, a show that I've talked about. And there would be other shows.
Father Knows Best, The Donna Reed Show.
You know, Have Gun Will Travel. There are a lot of popular shows, yes. It was one of those shows that we historians believe
and acknowledge was a very popular show.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Have you included any clips from I Love Lucy in your reliance materials?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I don't believe so.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q 45 percent of the evening television programs were sponsored by tobacco companies, according to the LNA-BAR
organization.
Have you included any clips from evening television programs that were sponsored by tobacco companies in your reliance
materials?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I am not certain in the sense that, for example, Leave it to Beaver is in there, and Leave it to Beaver -- you
know, there could have been an ad run during a Leave it to Beaver show at some point for a cigarette company.
So I -- again, what I'm looking at is Leave it to Beaver or other shows, movies, et cetera, songs that were sung, all kinds of
things that could have been up against or in the context of an ad at times.
For example, radio programs you might hear a song and then hear a radio jingle, and one of those could have been for a cigarette
company.
So I haven't included them because they ran alongside the particular advertising. I included them for the content itself.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So why did you include the Leave it to Beaver clip in your reliance materials? What does that clip include that you felt was
important to inform the public about the awareness of the health effects of smoking?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, I included Leave it to Beaver -- again, this was like I Love Lucy or any of these other shows I've just
mentioned, a very popular show and one that also went into reruns for a long time. So it would have been seen not just in the
50's but the 60's, 70's, 80's, possibly into the 90's. You could find it on YouTube likely today.

122In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
It showed Beaver smoking -- I think it was his dad's pipe and his older brother said to him, “Beaver, don't you know that
smoking could wreck ya,” meaning -- we don't know what “wreck ya” means. Emphysema, cancer. It just means it could be
really bad, ruin you.
And, in fact, you know, this is a phrase we hear all the time in these depositions where people are told it could ruin you in
some way or another.
So he says that, and Beaver says, “Well, Wally, all adults are always telling you that it's really bad for you so I thought if that
many adults told you it was bad for you, there must be something really fun about it.”
So to me this was emblematic of childhood, the way kids think, and also the fact that Beaver was getting consistent messages,
as would have been other children.
And the fact of course Florence Henderson -- Florence Henderson. Florence Patterson. Florence Henderson appears elsewhere
in these documents --
Florence Patterson, her children might have been around the age of the Beaver or she herself had only recently been a teenager.
She might have watched the show for all I know.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So you included that clip with the message that was anti tobacco, but you did not include I Love Lucy clips with Lucille Ball
and Desi Arnaz promoting cigarettes or a particular brand of cigarettes on their show?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. Mischaracterizes.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. That's I didn't think we were even talking about that.
When I was talking about the I Love Lucy show, we were simply talking about the show itself, and you were saying it was
sponsored by a company. That doesn't mean that they were promoting it per se necessarily.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Have you ever seen the clips from the I Love Lucy show that were run at the end of the program that was sponsored by
the tobacco companies?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Have I seen a show from the 50's?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I'm sorry.
Have you seen the if you want to call them an advertisement, that's fine. There really wasn't television advertisement, which
is why they had sponsorships.

But have you seen the clip from the end of the I Love Lucy shows that were run during the 50's when they were sponsored
by the tobacco companies where Lucille ball and Desi Arnaz promote a particular brand of cigarettes? Have you ever seen
any of those clips?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I may have, but I don't recall.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
They're definitely not included in your reliance materials.
A No.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
When there was 45 percent of evening programs being sponsored by cigarette companies and the average household was
watching six hours of television a day, that was quite a significant exposure to the messages that were being sent out by the
tobacco companies through television.
Would you disagree with that statement?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, you've included several things in there. We could assume that these figures are correct. I don't know if
they are or not. Let's say for the sake of argument that they are correct.
What that would mean is that people would be seeing some advertising. What was the message of the advertising is another
subject.
How did that come up against the other message messages with which they were being bombarded is yet another subject.
I don't think it in any way undermined the awareness of the hazards of smoking and the fact, is the Beaver said, that it could
wreck ya. W-R-E-C-K. No C. No C.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q C-K, I think.
A No, no C's. W-R-E-A-K.
Q W-R-E-C-K is correct.

Q Yes.
MR. BIGGER: We'll take a break. That's fine.
THE WITNESS: I think we need a break. I think we can tell that by the fact that we're not spelling the word “wreck” right.
(Recess.)
MR. BIGGER: Back on the record.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q We were talking about television sponsorship and advertising during the 50's and 60's when we left.
Have you ever seen the original Flintstones episodes that aired -- I want to say in the early 60's? It may have been the late
50's. I'm not sure.
But have you ever seen the original Flintstones episodes that aired at that time?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I watched them at that time.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Did you?
A Mm hmm.
Q When they were on evening television?
A I assume so.
Q When the show originally started it was actually on evening television, and it was intended to be for more of an adult audience.
A Yeah.
Q Winston cigarettes was a sponsor of the Flintstones.
Have you ever seen the Flintstones -- clips of the Flintstones television show where Fred and Barney sit down and light up
a Winston cigarette?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

A (Witness shakes head.)
Q I'll have to find it for you sometime and show it to you. I don't have it here. I wish I did.
You obviously didn't include it in your reliance materials, though, if you've never seen it.
A No. I've never seen it. I have some on the reliance materials a TV Guide thing showing that it was an evening program, as
you said. Oriented towards an adult audience.
Q Have you ever smoked cigarettes?
A No.
Q Anyone in your family ever smoke them?
A Yes.
Q By “your family,” I'm not trying to be too broad. Your immediate family.
A Yes.
Q Husband or --
A No.
Q Parents?
A No.

A Jeff Norell.
Q Jeff Norell.

A I'm sorry, I don't know.
Q How long ago was that?
A That the deposition was taken or that I read it?
Q That you read it.
A Maybe three months ago.

127In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A I think so, but I'm not 100 percent sure.
Q Why did you read a deposition of another historian just three months ago?
A I was interested to know what kind of questions come up and, therefore, to be better prepared for the universe of materials
that I would want to present.
Q You hadn't been involved in depositions or trials for five years, as you stated earlier, and so just to give yourself a refresher?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, as I said, I was interested -- this is Florida, and I had never been deposed in cases in Florida before. So
I was curious to know what the kinds of questions would be.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Anything that you read or saw that you didn't expect to see?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I really -- nothing struck me as surprising. But it was a few months ago, so I don't remember every phrase
either.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Did you learn anything?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Again, not nothing that I recall.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
Did you disagree with any of the opinions that he gave?
A I don't remember it well enough to say that either way. It didn't strike me as surprising. It struck me as straightforward.
Nothing jumped out at me that I recall disagreeing with.
But, you know, were I today sit down and examine every phrase, well, I might say something slightly different or have a
difference of opinion on something.
Q One of the opinions that Dr. Norell has given in past depositions is that, in his opinion, approximately 25 percent of the
information that was communicated about the health hazards of smoking contained a counterpoint by representatives of the
tobacco industry.

Do you understand what I'm saying when I'm talking about articles where within the article there is a counterpoint or a response
to the position that the article is setting forth?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yes. I understand what you're saying about a counterpoint.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I'm sure some or several of the articles that are in your reliance list are such articles where at the end or at some point in the
article typically someone from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, or TIRC, or the Tobacco Institute or the Center for
Tobacco Research, organizations we have discussed earlier, has a statement or statements contained in the article.
And you're aware of the type of articles I'm talking about?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I understand the type of articles you're talking about. They wouldn't -- if they are in there, they wouldn't be
very frequent.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So you would perhaps disagree with Dr. Norell that if he stated an opinion that the -- that 25 percent of the articles contained
a counterpoint or a response to what the article was setting forth and I believe -- I can't be specific. I apologize. But I believe
he's probably referring to articles in the 50's and 60's.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q We'll limit the question to that, whether he's referring to it or not.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: So I think what you're asking is would I agree with the number 25 percent.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you think it's 25 percent, or would you think that it was a lower number or a higher number?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think that the number has is in my experience much lower than that.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q What number would you say?
A Well, in one study I did, I found that the number would have been around five percent.

129In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q What study was that?
A I studied the Los Angeles Times at one time and did -- you know, was curious to know exactly what you were talking about,
and I found that roughly five percent of the time there was a passing reference. Sometimes even a disparaging reference, but
a passing reference to the position of the industry.
Q Were you curious to know or was that something you were doing as part of the research that you were being paid to do
for tobacco litigation?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It seems like an odd juxtaposition. I'm always interested in the research I do, whether I'm doing it in this case
or for a different kind of project.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Were you being paid to do the research?
A Yes, I was being compensated to do the research.
Q Okay.
As we said earlier, you are aware that in these cases, these Engle Progeny cases, there is legal findings regarding the fraudulent
concealment of the health effects of smoking cigarettes by the tobacco companies and the agreement of the companies to conceal
information regarding the health effects and addictive nature of smoking cigarettes?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. Calls for a legal conclusion.
THE WITNESS: What I would say is I'm aware there are findings, but I don't know the specific content of the findings as
you're describing it.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Assume that the finding is as I describe it, that the companies fraudulently concealed information regarding the health effects
of smoking. No, never mind. We don't need to go there.
A Okay.
Q We'll go there another time.
You stated that you reviewed Ms. Patterson's deposition before reaching your opinions in this case?
A Yes, I did.
Q And you also reviewed the fact witness depositions and took notes on them. So all the fact witness depositions that you
reviewed are indicated by the notes we have marked as an exhibit?

BY MR. BIGGER:
Q All the fact witness depositions that you have reviewed are included in the notes that we marked as composite Exhibit 5
for this deposition?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I take notes on all depositions. And so all of the depositions I've read about Florence Patterson I have notes on.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
So it's safe to conclude there aren't any other depositions that you reviewed that we don't have notes on?
A I don't think so.
Q Okay.
A Everyone misses a trick sometime in life, but I think I'm pretty consistent about that.
Q Is there any material that you requested from R.J. Reynolds and have not yet received?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So is there any additional material that you need to review before giving your full and complete opinions?
A I can -- could walk into court today and deliver the opinions based on the materials I've given you and based on what I've
already written down, et cetera.
Q Okay.
A At the same time, my research is ongoing. So I don't plan to stop learning anything about the subject in the next -- I don't
even know how long it will be before it goes to trial. So I should be able to do that.
If something came across my desk that provided further information, then, you know, I would file that away up here in my
files or whatever.
Q Well, between September of 2008 and May of 2009, you added 1800 additional documents to your reliance list.
As you sit here today, do you plan to add any additional documents to your reliance list?
A As I sit here today, I definitely do not plan to add 1800, and I don't even have a plan for 10.

Q Do you have a plan to add one?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I don't have a specific plan.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay.
A I would not like to close the door, however, that there may be something else I'll find down the road that would be of additional
interest. But --
Q As you sit here today --
A I don't think it's very likely.
Q You have no plan to do so as you sit here today?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Not that I can think of.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Is there anything else that we haven't discussed regarding your opinions in the Florence Patterson case that you feel is
necessary for us to discuss?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I'm really here to answer your questions.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you feel like we have discussed all of your opinions that you're prepared to give in the Florence Patterson case?
A No, I don't think so.
Q As you sit here right now what other opinions do you plan to give that we haven't discussed?
A Well, I think that if we were to go back to my disclosure statement isn't that what it's called? we could discuss it all in
further detail.
But, you know, it seems like you've covered the waterfront. I'm not thinking of anything right now that I think is going to be
really important.
But, obviously, I've spent ten years researching it, so we could have quite a long conversation -- a much longer conversation
than we are having right now about everything I've looked at and what my opinions are on it.

Q You say you've spent ten years researching it. But your testimony earlier -- maybe it wasn't, I thought it was was that you
were retained for these Florida cases in January 2007.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. Mischaracterizes.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q When were you retained to work on these Florida cases?
A In the Florida cases, as I said, in 1999, 2000, roughly right around in there.
Q For the Florida cases, the Engle Progeny cases?
A For the Florida cases. Right? Am I losing track of numbers now? Wait. Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. 2007. It is late in the day.
Q That's okay. Your first invoice was for January 2007?
A No, Florida, it's much later. I'm sorry. The reason why I'm saying ten years is because I'm going back to 1999, which is when
I started researching the general topic of public awareness.
Q That's when --
A So that's ten years.
And then the Engle cases or the cases related to Florida are all in late -- late 2006 and early 2007. Thank you for catching that.
Q That's no problem. I want the record to be clear. Like I said, there's no trick questions here today.
A Very good. I tell my students that all the time.
Q It's true.
When exactly, what year, was Florence Patterson aware of the health hazards of smoking cigarettes?
A I can tell you that she said she was aware in 1990 for the very first time that there were any hazards associated with smoking
cigarettes.
She said a doctor for the first time told her that in 1990. Dr. Modh.
Q What is your opinion regarding when Florence Patterson was aware of the health hazards of smoking cigarettes? What year,
in your opinion, was she first aware of the health hazards of smoking cigarettes and, speaking in a general sense, generally the
health hazards of smoking cigarettes? Do you understand my question?
A Yes I do.
Q Okay.

133In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
A Well, it seems to me that all the evidence points to her knowing this very early. She said she snuck her first cigarette when
she was around 11. She stole them, and she hid this both from her parents and her teachers. She said she smoked to -- quote,
to be with the in crowd.
I know that she again, she said she didn't know they were hazardous until 1990. She said she had never -- had never heard the
slang cancer sticks, for example, or coffin nail.
But then her grandson later said that the first time he ever heard the phrase was his grandma using it.
So that suggests to me that there are other kinds of things that are in these documents that she knew, seems to me had to have
known much, much earlier than 1990. Probably -- she was born in 1940. Yeah, 1940. So I'd say by 1950 sounds like she would
have known it.
She certainly would have been told it in school. And it sounds like her parents talked to her about not smoking, too.
And, of course, like anybody, she sees doctors from time to time. And as a number of people said in depositions, they've never
met a doctor who didn't ask them, “Do you smoke? And, if you do, you shouldn't.”
So she says even though she was seeing doctors all through you know, at least through the 60's -- well, she had children, her
first child, in the 50's. So she had seen a doctor at least then.
She had -- she worked at a hospital in the 60's. Worked at a hospital in the 70's. So she must have interacted with doctors
consistently.
In a place like Florida in by 1965 I think it was 95 percent, something like that -- 95 percent of Florida physicians -- I assume
New York would be pretty similar had warned patients who smoked that they shouldn't do it.
So I really see that it's very hard to draw any conclusion, other than that she knew very early.
Q You don't know when, though? You can't name a specific year when you can pinpoint that she was aware of the health
hazards of smoking cigarettes?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q It's just your opinion?
A Again, I'd have to -- I have to -- what's the word -- infer this or deduce it --
Q Sure.
A from the things that she said and people around her said.
So, since she said she snuck her first smokes, because she knew she shouldn't do it, I she says age 11. So I think that would
be a good age to peg that she said she knows it.
I think she probably, however, did know it earlier, because people talk about this earlier than that -- that age, typically. You
know, you start hearing about it in schools earlier on. So 11 or younger.

134In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q That's your opinion?
A Yeah, that's my best estimate. Best guess.
Q When exactly did Florence Patterson first become aware of the addictive nature of smoking cigarettes?
A I think that that would probably be around that same time, since that's one of the things that was in educational literature,
for example, that it was very hard to stop.
So I think that that piece of information is a part of the little package that people get when they first learn about tobacco, that
it's habit forming, or addictive, and that it's not good for you.
Q Do you know where the -- do you know the first time in the public domain it appeared that smoking cigarettes at a young
age can physically alter your -- can biologically alter your brain?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: No. I really would have to go back to my materials and search for that. It's not something I would know
off the top.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you recall seeing any newspaper articles about that?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: You know, it's kind of a vague term, affect the brain. So I've seen lots of references from the 19th century
into the 20th century about its effect on the brain.
The way you phrased it, though, it sounds to me a little bit like a more recent phrasing of it. So I don't quite know what you're
driving at.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q And so it's your opinion that at age 11 in 1951, I believe it was, Florence Patterson was aware of the addictive nature of
smoking cigarettes?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think it is the case, demonstrably easy, in fact, very easy to show that all around her she was being told that
cigarettes are habit forming and that they're bad for you.
And so I think she would have heard that and understood it at that age. Very -- 11 is actually a pretty -- you know, an age where
you remember what people tell you and you're not a baby. She certainly understood language by then.

Q You say that it was all around her. Can you point me to a specific document in your reliance materials that Florence Patterson
was exposed to at age 11?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Just one document. Any document in your reliance materials that you believe Florence Patterson was exposed to at age 11.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: As we discussed earlier, I cannot point to a document and say that she definitely held this document.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q I understand. I'm asking --
A But exposed to, yes.
You know, the Wilson, for example. The Wilson textbook I think is the likeliest one they used in the Brooklyn parish.
Q Can you find that document number for me?
A On a different rendition of this list, they were in chronological order. Now it would be very hard for me to find it. I would
be happy to try, but I'm not sure how long it will take. Is that okay?
Q I see what you're saying. The list we were provided is --
A I mean, to find it, it's in what? There's 170 pages.
Q Right.
A I've got to find the edition at age 11 that she --
Q What's the -- why don't you just tell me --
(Whereupon the Deposition Officer requested all parties to speak one at a time.)
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Why don't you just tell me the document, the full title of the document that it's your opinion she was exposed to at age 11.
A Age 11? What grade is that?
Q Fifth grade.
A Fifth or sixth? You're 12 in seventh grade. So sixth grade maybe. Fifth or sixth.
Well, okay. I think this is the likeliest book. Again, I can't put it in her hands, metaphorically speaking.

136In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
The book that -- I think it's likely is that the Catholic schools in Brooklyn and that the parish that she was in which later split
off and became a different parish, by the way.
But at this time it was under the Brooklyn diocese. Later it was under a different diocese. but at this time Brooklyn diocese.
The book that they seemed to preference was Wilson's Health at Work and Play. This was published in 1948. She would have
been reading it in 1950, '51, and she would have been 11 years old. It says,
“Alcohol and nicotine are poisonous substances called narcotics.”
“In every state there is a law against selling or giving tobacco in any form to persons under twenty-one years old. These laws
are to protect you.”
“People who smoke a lot sometimes develop coughs.”
“Smoking sometimes causes a disease of the arteries.”
In other parts of the book they would explain what the arteries do, that the arteries bring or deliver or remove blood from your
brain and your heart. They deliver blood, obviously. So it says,
“Some people believe that tobacco smoking is one of the causes of a kind of heart disease.”
Now, that seems to me to be important information because kids even that young know that your heart is if your heart stops,
that's like the worst thing that happens, that can happen and you'll die from that.
It says also,
“You will be interested in knowing about an investigation a scientist recently made. After getting all the information he could,
he concluded that heavy smokers do not live so long as those who do not smoke.”
That's some of what she would have been exposed to. I think.
Q For the record, you read that from the document we've marked as Exhibit 7, which is your notes that you took during the
course of reviewing materials?
A Right.
And in this larger list we would find that book, and the book is called -- it's by Charles Wilson published by Bobs-Merrill, and
I think I said what year it was published.
Q 1948?
A 1948. And it would certainly be on this list. I'm hoping it is, unless it fell off.
Q Although you don't know that's the book that her school actually utilized, your best inference is that that one was available
for them to choose from?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

137In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
THE WITNESS: Yes. But there are more reasons why I think that's the likeliest book.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay. What are those reasons?
A This was the only book on the diocese's list, the list of the diocese, where it spelled out the individual titles of the health
series. For the other books it just gave a series name.
So the fact that they gave greater specificity makes me think it's more likely the one -- it's very likely the one they used.
The other, to me, important reasons are -- is that this Bobs-Merrill text was actually the one that was state mandated in Florida
at the same time and state mandated in California at the same time, which means it was a very popular, very well-respected text.
So I think it's likely, considering what the diocese said about it, considering what other states were doing, which were actually
publishing their own editions, like the California state edition, the Florida state edition of this Bobs-Merrill text, that this is a
pretty a pretty good guess, an educated guess, if you will, as to the book that she and others would have reading.
Q And did you include the list of diocese materials in your reliance materials?
A Yes.
Q That's in there as well?
A They should be. That would be under the Catholic Educator.
Q Okay.
Do you know where in your reliance materials there are any articles or documents of any kind that discuss the risk of developing
bladder cancer from smoking cigarettes?
A Yes. There are references to it in the documents.
Q Can you name for me or point me to any particular document?
A I'm sorry, but I would have to go through the documents to pull that out. I'm sure I could, given time.
Q But you were aware that there are documents that exist that refer to the risk of developing bladder cancer?
A Yes.
Q What kind of document was it that you were --
A You know, the one that -- the ones that strike me the most are newspaper articles on the subject, and that's -- were I to retrace
my path for you, that's the first place I'd start looking.
But I think it's likely in some of the Surgeon General's reports too, but I'm just not as certain about that.

138In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
Q What year are the articles that you're referring to, the newspaper articles?
A I'm sorry. I would be really hazarding a guess. I would like not to guess.
Q Well, when was the first Surgeon General's report to link smoking as a cause of bladder cancer?
A Well, that's what I'm saying. I'm not sure. I would have to go to the Surgeon General's report and actually look back. There
are 20 or more of them. Twenty or 30 of them. And I'd have to go back and see which is the first time, and I don't know if
it was 1964. Could have been 1967.
Q If I told you it was the 2004 Surgeon General's report was the first time that smoking cigarettes was linked as a causative
factor to bladder cancer, would you have a reason to disagree with that?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I simply don't know. So I don't really have a basis for agreeing or disagreeing.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Okay. So you believe --
A I would be happy to go back and look.
Q But you believe it to be earlier than that as you sit here today?
A No.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Actually, no, I'm not saying that. I'm saying I just don't recall when the earliest references were.
So I would be happy to go back and find them, but I don't know sitting here, because there are so many ailments that have been
associated with it and so many types of cancer over so many you know, more than a century. Well more than a century.
So, therefore, to trace that one down, I think I would have to do a little more field work.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Why despite what you call the widespread public knowledge of the health hazards of smoking cigarettes did the tobacco
companies deny that cigarettes caused or that it wasn't proven that cigarettes caused any of these diseases?

Q In your opinion, why would they deny that?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Maybe you could take that apart for me. Are you saying -- just repeat it in a shortened form.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Do you agree that tobacco companies --
A It seemed like you got two things together.
Q Do you agree that the tobacco companies denied the link between smoking cigarettes and disease?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Yeah. I do deny that. I don't agree with that statement.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q You don't agree? You think that they didn't deny it?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think they said there was a link. I think in the Frank Statement they say these two things have been linked.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q The statement that says, “We do not believe our products are injurious to human health,” do you think that statement indicates
a link between smoking cigarettes and health hazards?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: They say in the Frank Statement that there have been reports that cigarette smoking is in some way linked
with lung cancer in human beings.
Then they go on to say that there should be more research on this because it's a very serious charge.
I don't read that as a denial. I read that as a different kind of statement.

A Sure.

A Mm-hmm.
Q -- towards the bottom?
A Right.
Q The second sentence from the bottom?
A Mm-hmm.
Q What does that say?
A Is this the sentence that goes, “We believe the products we make are not injurious to health”?
Q Yes. That's the one.
A Okay.
Q Thanks.
You stated that the material in your reliance list are a representative sample of what was available in the public domain regarding
the health hazards of smoking cigarettes. Is that correct?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: It's a representative sampling of my research, which I think was pretty thorough.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Was your research neutral? In other words, did you try to include documents that were informing the public of a health hazard
of smoking and documents that were denying that smoking was a health hazard?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Let me say to the first part of your question that, yes, it was neutral, unbiased; that I looked at as best I could
the full universe of things that people were hearing about about the health risks, and that universe, of course, changed over time.
Certain risks became more deep more well articulated, better understood.
Of course, even to the present, doctors imperfectly understand the human body. So that it's a wide range of -- it shows a
progression over time beginning with the understanding that it could wreck ya and that it was harmful and with the myriad
ways in which the harm could take place were more thoroughly articulated over time.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q And it's your opinion that there was never a time when there wasn't public awareness that smoking was a health hazard?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.

141In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Common awareness that smoking was a health hazard.
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, there was a time when it wasn't known that it was a health hazard.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q When was that?
A Before 1492. 1493.
Q So, at every year since 1492 there has been common public knowledge that smoking is a health hazard smoking cigarettes
is a health hazard?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: There have been consistent statements since that time about the ways in which tobacco is harmful.
This knowledge might become more widespread with the invention of newspapers and print, for example, things like that that
we and then as the product becomes more prevalent and more people are exposed to the product, then more people know about it.
But since the very beginning there have been serious warnings by public officials that it's deeply injurious.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Have there been any inconsistent statements?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: What do you mean by “inconsistent statements”?
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q Well, you said that all the statements since 1492 have been consistent.
I'm asking: Have there been any statements, public statements, inconsistent with the belief that smoking cigarettes is injurious
to health?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: Well, for example, in the mid 50's let's that period, the period that the Frank Statement falls within, and that
may give us some reason -- some way to understand this.
There was a debate over whether smog caused lung cancer or cigarettes caused lung cancer or whether it was smog and cigarettes
together that caused lung cancer.

142In re: ENGLE PROGENY CASES TOBACCO LITIGATION...., 2009 WL 6666232...
So there is a conversation that's going on that's in the public domain out there right -- you know, in everyone's from everyone's
point of view.
So, in that sense -- I don't know if contradictory is the right word for it, but there would be some people who would say it's
less injurious or some people would say it was more injurious.
There would be a debate about how it was injurious, what chemicals caused the injury. So there would be differences of
opinion, just like the one in the Frank Statement itself, where someone might say, as they did here, it's linked, which is a way
of broadcasting the harm of it because already it's an alert. By the way, be alert here, the first sentence, it's been linked to lung
cancer, which would be frightening to me if I were a smoker.
But then it goes on to say but we don't think it does that, you know. Other people have said that, but we don't think that.
And, of course, there were the National Cancer Institute who said that smog was a risk. But, again, we have to keep remembering
there that -- what they're having a conversation about there is the specific disease of lung cancer. They're not talking about
Berger's disease or tobacco blindness or tobacco heart or tobacco cough.
So there's sort of a lot of layers to the conversation. And sometimes on the surface maybe they seem like they contradict each
other, but I think the overall message is pretty clear. They were bad for you.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q So do you think that there's anything that the tobacco companies concealed?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form. Calls for a legal conclusion.
THE WITNESS: Well, I don't know about a legal conclusion. That could be accurate. But certainly it's outside the scope of my
research. I did not research what they were up to. I was researching what the public was up to.
BY MR. BIGGER:
Q But if everyone in the public knew, then, obviously, there was nothing that could have been concealed; right?
MS. LINDSAY: Object to form.
THE WITNESS: I think the information about smoking's harm was right out there in the public.
I think that the public knew that it was habit forming, addicting, enslaving, whatever the term was of the period, and that it
could give you cancer or that it could, you know, lead to blindness. And people didn't know all of the ways, and medical science
was fairly inexpert compared to today.
But people did know it could cause you harm or that they at least be warned that it could cause you harm. That experts thought
it caused people harm, caused them to live less long.
MR. BIGGER: Okay. I have nothing further on the Patterson case.
MS. LINDSAY: I am going to probably have a few questions. Can we take a couple minutes for me to review my notes? And
I'll be very quick.
