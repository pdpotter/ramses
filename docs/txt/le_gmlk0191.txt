2	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Today's date is
3	October the 21st, 2009. The time is approximately
4	11:03 a.m. My name is James Hollingsworth, I'm the
5	videographer. The court reporter is Nora Meola.
228388
6	We are present at the Law Offices Keane and
7	Rease, et al . , in St. Petersburg, Florida, we are
8	here for the purpose of taking the deposition of
9	Louis Kyriakoudes, Ph.D. The case is instituted in
10	the Circuit Court for the 17th Judicial Circuit in
11	and for Broward County, Florida. The short style of
12	the case is in Re Engle Progeny cases as it pertains
13	to Naugle.
14	I will now ask the attorneys to introduce
15	themselves, beginning with the plaintiff's attorney.
16	MR. McPHARLlN: Todd McPharlin on behalf of the
17	plaintiff.
18	MR. KEANE: My name is Michael Keane. I
19	represent the witness.
20	MS. BROWN: Jenny Brown, Philip Morris USA.
21	MR. HENK: Pete Henk, Phillip Morris USA.
22	MS. CASE: Ashlie Case, R.J. Reynolds.
23	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: will the court reporter
24	kindly swear in the witness.
25	LOUIS KYRIAKOUDES, Ph.D., called as a witness
1	by the Defendant, having been first duly sworn,
2	testified as follows:
3	THE WITNESS: I do.
4	DIRECT EXAMINATION
5	BY MS. BROWN:
6	Q. Good morning, Dr. Kyriakoudes.
7	A. Good morning.
8	Q. For the record, could you, please, state your
9	name and your work address.
10	A. My name is Louis Michael Kyriakoudes. Do you
11	need that spelling? My work address is the Center for
12	Oral History and Cultural Heritage, Box 5175, University
13	of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, Mississippi 39406.
14	And actually I should qualify or clarify that. The
15	address should read, 118 College Drive, No. 5175,
16	University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg,
17	Mississippi.
18	Q. And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, we've met before. You
19	know my name is Jenny Brown.
20	A. That's correct.
21	Q. Now, this is certainly not your first
22	deposition; right?
228388
23	A. That's correct.
24	Q. You have been through this several times
25	before; correct?
6
1	A. That's correct. Yes.
2	Q. So you understand that if at any point today I
3	ask you a question and you don't understand it, you
4	should let me know. And I will try to rephrase the
5	question so that you do understand it; correct?
6	A. That's right. I will do that.
7	Q. And you also understand that if for some reason
8	you need to take a break, just let me know. And
9	assuming there's no question pending, that is a good
10	point to take a break, we can take a break; correct?
11	A. Okay. I will let you know.
12	MR. mcpharlin: Let's get the agreement we
13	discussed off the record on the record. This first
14	part of the deposition is going to be limited to the
15	subject matter of the motion to compel that was
16	brought before Judge Streitfeld at the last CMC.
Page 6
17	And the order was that you would have two hours to
18	talk to Professor Kyriakoudes about the university
19	of Florida matter. And that -- that's how the first
20	part of the deposition is going to proceed, when
21	you concluded that, whether it's two hours or the
22	end of your questioning, then we'll move on to the
23	case specific. Okay?
24	MS. BROWN: That's fine.
25	MR. KEANE: Let me just make a -- introduce
7
1	myself on the record, but I'm Mike Keane. I'm
2	representing the witness in this aspect of the
3	matter. And I want to say for the record now, he
4	will read the deposition at the end of the -- of its
5	conclusion, reserve that right. He will not waive
6	that. I perceive that because the motion that is to
7	be heard is -- will have far-reaching impacts on
8	this gentleman, that he is sole positioned as a
9	quasi-party because of that, and I may have some
10	questions of him when you conclude your examination
11	at the end.
12	MS. BROWN: So just so I'm clear, Mr. Keane,
13	it's your position that because of a pending motion
14	to strike Dr. Kyriakoudes with the Naugle case, he's
15	now become a party to the Naugle case?
16	MR. KEANE: No. That's not what I said. I
17	said that your -- the motion has pretty far-reaching
18	ramifications. I'm sure you understand that. And
19	that there's going to be, as I understand it, a
20	hearing very shortly on that. And if it becomes
21	necessary, I reserve the right to ask some
22	questions.
23	MS. BROWN: Now, Mr. Keane, am I correct that
24	you have not otherwise entered any kind of a general
25	appearance in the Naugle matter?
8
1	MR. KEANE: I checked the rule and there is no
2	rule that applies to this situation in the rules of
3	judicial administration. I am not appearing as a
4	lawyer in the case for a party. I don't believe he
5	is a party. I called him a quasi-party because of
6	the nature of the relief that's being sought, it's
7	a little bit unusual. I'm sure you understand.
8	BY MS. BROWN:
9	Q. And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, as Mr. Keane said, he's
10	here today as your lawyer. Is that your understanding?
11	A. Yes.
12	Q. And you retained Mr. Keane?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. When did you retain Mr. Keane?
15	MR. MCPHARLIN: That's -- that's completely
16	irrelevant and not the subject of your -- the
17	limitations that are the scope of this first part of
18	the examination. So you need to ask him about the
19	matters related to the university of Florida, not
20	about his retention of his private counsel. That's
21	not what you were given permission to do.
22	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, Mr. Keane is here,
23	as he's already stated, because of the motion that
24	is pending which all relates to the University of
228388
25	Florida and the Proctor matter.
1	MR. McPHARLlN: uh-hum.
2	MS. BROWN: So anything related to Mr. Keane's
3	presence here and any questions that Mr. Keane has
4	to ask, I assume, pertains to this matter. So you
5	can state your objections. I think objection to
6	form is appropriate under Florida Law and we'll keep
7	moving. I will tell you, if you insist or making
8	speeches throughout, that will be detected from the
9	two hours. I am not spending my two hours listening
10	to long objections or speaking objections.
11	MR. McPHARLlN: Right. And if I think you're
12	asking an area that goes outside of what the judge
13	ordered or if I think you're asking a question that
14	a motion for protective order would be required,
15	then I am going to make that objection and that
16	instruction to the witness. Because you have -- you
17	have your guidelines as to what you can ask in the
18	subject matter of this portion of the deposition.
Page 10
19	And that his retention of Mr. Keane is not part of
20	the subject matter.
21	MS. BROWN: I understand that's your position,
22	Mr. McPharlin. I disagree with you. So if you want
23	to instruct the witness not to answer, you can do
24	that, but there is a question pending.
25	BY MS. BROWN:
10
1	Q. And the question is, when did you retain
2	Mr. Keane, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: And I am going to instruct him
4	not to answer. That is not part of what this
5	deposition is about, it has absolutely no relevance
6	to what you are here to ask him about.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, have you worked with Mr. Keane
9	before?
10	MR. MCPHARLIN: You can answer that.
11	A. No. I have never worked with him.
12	BY MS. BROWN:
13	Q. You've never testified as an expert witness in
14	any of Mr. Keane's cases?
15	A. No.
16	Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you understand that Judge
17	Streitfeld has given us two hours to depose you on your
18	involvement in, and/or knowledge, of Dr. Proctor's
19	actions with respect to university of Florida research
20	assistants and your testimony on these issues. Is that
21	your understanding?
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to the form.
23	A. Well, I understand that you've been -- I mean,
24	yes. And I understand that you've been restricted,
25	although, I'm not privy to all of the knowledge of that.
11
1	I haven't read any documents related to this.
2	BY MS. BROWN:
3	Q. Okay. But you do understand that Judge
4	Streitfeld has permitted us to question you regarding
5	your knowledge and testimony about Dr. Proctor's actions
6	in relation to the university of Florida grad students;
7	correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	MR. MCPHARLIN: Object to the form.
10	BY MS. BROWN:
11	Q. Now, given the fact that we have two hours,
12	will you cooperate with me this morning in using that
13	time efficiently?
14	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to the form.
15	Argumentative.
16	A. I will do as I've always done, which is try to
17	be as helpful as possible.
18	BY MS. BROWN:
19	Q. And so when it's possible to do so, will you
20	give me a yes or no answer?
21	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to the form.
22	A. Yes.
23	BY MS. BROWN:
24	Q. Will you do your best to limit your answers to
25	testimony that's responsive to my questions?
1	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to the form.
2	Argumentative.
3	A. I will do my best to answer the questions as
4	best I can.
5	BY MS. BROWN:
6	Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you know you're under
7	oath today; correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. And it's the same oath that you've taken in
10	prior depositions; correct?
11	A. That's correct.
12	Q. To tell the truth, the whole truth -- excuse
13	me -- and nothing but the truth; correct?
14	A. That's correct.
15	Q. what did you do to prepare for today's
16	deposition?
17	MR. McPHARLlN: Hold on, Professor Kyriakoudes.
18	You are not to discuss anything that you did to
19	prepare that would in any way reveal conversations
20	or discussions that you had with Mr. Keane or in any
Page 14
21	way reveal discussions that you had of any trial
22	strategy nature. That would be protected by work
23	product. Do you understand?
24	THE WITNESS: Yes.
25	BY MS. BROWN:
13
1	Q. Go ahead and answer that question. And the
2	question was, what did you do to prepare for your
3	deposition today?
4	MR. MCPHARLIN: And he's answering it with
5	that -- with that instruction.
6	MS. BROWN: And, Mr. McPharlin, I mean, we can
7	talk at another point about your assertion of some
8	work product privilege that protects conversations
9	regarding trial strategy with Dr. Kyriakoudes.
10	BY MS. BROWN:
11	Q. But first, subject to those limitations, might
12	you answer my question and then we can probe further?
13	MR. MCPHARLIN: He is answering it with the
228388
14	instruction that I gave him to not reveal work
15	product or attorney-client privilege matters, just
16	so the record is clear.
17	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, I think the record
18	is incredibly clear. Now, if you would let
19	Dr. Kyriakoudes answer the question, we can move
20	this along.
21	MR. MCPHARLIN: Go ahead.
22	A. To prepare for this deposition, I pulled
23	together some materials that were responsive to the
24	schedule A, which I brought together. I inquired of
25	Mr. McPharlin, prior to today, some questions I had
14
1	about -- about the -- about the smoker, the plaintiff.
2	I don't know if it's technically the plaintiff, but
3	Ms. Naugle. And those questions were really relating to
4	when she was born, where she was born, you know, her
5	position in time and space as that kind of just vocal
6	context. That's what I did.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. Did you meet with Mr. Keane in preparation for
9	your deposition today?
10	A. well --
11	MR. McPHARLlN: She asked you if you met with
12	him.
13	A. Yeah, I did. I met with him.
14	BY MS. BROWN:
15	Q. When did you meet with Mr. Keane?
16	A. This morning.
17	Q. Was that the first time you met with Mr. Keane?
18	A. Yes.
19	Q. And how long did you meet this morning?
20	A. I think I got here about 9:00, 9:30, 9:40. And
21	it's 11:20 now. We met for that period before.
22	Q. Was there anyone else in attendance at your
23	meeting with Mr. Keane?
24	A. Not when I met with him. No.
25	Q. Did you meet with Mr. McPharlin this morning?
1	A. Just briefly as he walked into the building, in
Page 17
2	the hallway and exchanged pleasantries and greetings.
3	Q. in preparation for today's deposition, did you
4	meet with anyone else from Mr. McPharlin's office?
5	A. No.
6	Q. We talked about whether you had met Mr. Keane
7	before in preparation for today's deposition. Had you
8	talked to Mr. Keane before this morning?
9	A. I had a phone call. Yes.
10	Q. And when was that?
11	A. I had a phone call with him to initially --
12	MR. MCPHARLIN: Dr. -- Professor, don't discuss
13	why you called him or what you discussed.
14	THE WITNESS: Okay.
15	MR. MCPHARLIN: She wants to know when.
16	A. I think I've had two brief phone calls with
17	Mr. Keane prior to today.
18	MS. BROWN: One thing I'd like to seek some
19	clarification on is, are you asserting
20	Dr. Kyriakoudes' attorney-client privilege, Todd?
21	MR. MCPHARLIN: I'm an officer of the court.
22	So if he is going to reveal --
Page 18
23	MR. KEANE: I will be glad to do that, if we
24	want to -- if you want to put that burden on me, I
25	will do that.
16
1	MS. BROWN: Okay. I just assume that's why you
2	were here, Mr. Keane, was to protect his personal
3	rights.
4	MR. McPHARLlN: Right. He's also a witness in
5	this case. So if I feel like you're asking an
6	improper question or if you're asking a question
7	that would require him to do something he is not
8	supposed to be doing, then I will instruct him.
9	MS. BROWN: So my question to you, though, is
10	are you asserting his attorney-client privilege? is
11	that what you're doing?
12	MR. McPHARLlN: I am giving him -- I'm telling
13	him not to discuss matters that are confidential and
14	protected by attorney-client privilege. I think
15	that's pretty clear. So I think your question is
16	unnecessary.
17	BY MS. BROWN:
18	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, when was your first call with
19	Mr. Keane related to preparing for this deposition?
20	A. I'm sorry, could you -- I couldn't hear you.
21	Q. Let me rephrase. When was your first phone
22	call with Mr. Keane?
23	A. Oh, when? I just couldn't make out that first
24	word. About, I would guess about -- approximately two
25	weeks ago.
17
1	Q. And how long did that call last?
2	A. Probably no more than a half hour. Probably
3	considerably less. I don't recall exactly.
4	Q. Did you talk to Mr. Keane again between then
5	and this morning?
6	A. Yes.
7	Q. When was your second conversation with
8	Mr. Keane?
9	A. it would have been last week.
228388
10	Q. And how long did that conversation last?
11	A. It was very brief. Maybe five minutes.
12	Q. Was that a telephone call?
13	A. it was a telephone call.
14	Q. And, I'm sorry, how many minutes?
15	A. Maybe five minutes.
16	Q. Any other occasions in which you've talked to
17	Mr. Keane?
18	A. I had a brief call this week.
19	Q. And when was that?
20	A. Today is Wednesday. I think it might have been
21	Monday.
22	Q. And how long did that call last?
23	A. Less than five minutes.
24	Q. Any other phone calls with Mr. Keane?
25	A. I don't think so. No.
18
1	Q. Now, of the phone calls we've just discussed,
2	the one two weeks ago, the one last week and the one on
3	Monday, did anyone else participate in that phone
Page 21
4	conversation? Was there anyone else on the phone?
5	A. No. No. it was just me and Mr. Keane.
6	Q. And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, are you asserting an
7	attorney-client privilege of your conversations with
8	Mr. Keane?
9	MR. KEANE: Yes, he is.
10	A. Yes.
11	BY MS. BROWN:
12	Q. Did you review any materials in preparation for
13	your deposition today?
14	A. Aside from what I mentioned earlier in my
15	earlier question, no.
16	Q. Did you review any of your prior depositions in
17	preparation for today's deposition?
18	A. No, I did not.
19	Q. Now, you were deposed four times in Engle
20	Progeny cases from June 25th to August 24, 2009;
21	correct?
22	A. That's probably right. That sounds about
23	right. Yeah.
24	Q. Just so we're clear, you were deposed in
Page 22
25	Barbanell on June 25th; correct?
1	A. That's right.
2	Q. And then you were deposed in Grossman?
3	A. Grossman was next. That's right.
4	Q. And then in August you were deposed in Willis
5	and in Evers; correct?
6	MR. MCPHARLIN: Counsel, these questions have
7	all been asked in the prior deposition. You've
8	asked all of those questions, every single question
9	you just asked in the prior deposition. So given
10	the limitations of the court about not re-asking the
11	questions, you're not -- you're not abiding by that.
12	So you've just asked three questions previously
13	asked.
14	MS. BROWN: Is that an objection, Todd? Are
15	you objecting?
16	MR. MCPHARLIN: I am stating -- I am stating an
17	objection. Yes. So you asked him, but I am going
18	to limit you, again, to the judge's instructions.
19	MR. KEANE: Do you have the order?
20	MS. BROWN: Why don't you limit me to the
21	judge's order, Mr. McPharlin, which indicates that
22	the subject matter of these two hours --
23	MR. HENK: Do you have an objection to me
24	handing you the order?
25	MR. KEANE: I will take the order. Thank you.
20
1	MR. HENK: You ought to read it.
2	MS. BROWN: I will read -- I will read the
3	order to you, Mr. McPharlin. Defendant may question
4	Dr. Kyriakoudes for two hours on the specific issues
5	of his knowledge of and/or involvement with any
6	alleged inappropriate conduct by Dr. Robert Proctor
7	in connection with research assistants employed by
8	defense expert historian, Dr. Greg Michel, and
9	Dr. Kyriakoudes' prior testimony on these issues.
10	BY MS. BROWN:
11	Q. So the question to you was, then Willis and
228388
12	Evers you were deposed in in August; correct?
13	A. That's right.
14	Q. And then finally on August 24th, you were
15	deposed in the Koballa case; right?
16	A. That is right.
17	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection. Also previously
18	asked in the prior deposition.
19	BY MS. BROWN:
20	Q. Now, as to each of those depositions, just as
21	you did today, you reserved the right to read and sign
22	the deposition transcripts; correct?
23	A. That's correct.
24	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection. Previously asked in
25	prior depositions. Counsel, you're doing it again.
21
1	You're asking all questions that have been
2	previously asked. You haven't asked a single
3	question that hasn't already been asked.
4	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, because I am
5	entitled by the judge's order to question

6	Dr. Kyriakoudes about his prior testimony on these
7	issues, there's going to be some need to lay some
8	foundation about that prior testimony.
9	MR. McPHARLlN: You told the judge that you
10	would not ask him a single question that had already
11	been asked. You've already asked him -- every
12	single question you've asked so far related to this
13	matter is a question that has already been asked.
14	The judge granted your motion based on your
15	representation, as an officer of the court, that you
16	would not ask him a question that has already been
17	asked. Each one of these questions has already been
18	asked.
19	MS. BROWN: Okay. Well, Mr. McPharlin, you can
20	continue to make an objection. I would ask you to
21	just confine yourself to an objection so that we can
22	continue to expeditiously move this along.
23	MR. McPHARLlN: I am not going to allow you to
24	continue this. So if you keep doing it, keep asking
25	questions over and over again that have already been
1	asked, I am going -- I am going to instruct him not
2	to answer.
3	MS. BROWN: Madam court reporter, as you go
4	today, are you keeping -- does it keep log of a
5	running time entry?
6	COURT REPORTER: Yes.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. Again, Dr. Kyriakoudes, just as you did this
9	morning, you reserved in those other depositions your
10	right to read and sign the deposition transcript;
11	correct?
12	A. That's correct.
13	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked.
14	BY MS. BROWN:
15	Q. And you understood that you have 30 days to
16	review the transcript and then you can make whatever
17	corrections you need to on an Errata sheet; correct?
18	MR. MCPHARLIN: Also previously asked.
19	A. That's correct.
20	BY MS. BROWN:
21	Q. Now, you do not intend to testify today that
22	any of the transcripts, Barbanell, Grossman, Willis,
23	Evers or Koballa, contain any inaccurate recording in
24	your testimony; is that correct?
25	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
23
1	A. Ask -- I'm sorry, I am not following -- sure if
2	I'm following you. Just run that by me again.
3	BY MS. BROWN:
4	Q. Okay. Do you intend today to testify that any
5	of the transcripts in those cases: Barbanell, Grossman,
6	Willis, Evers or Koballa, contain any transcription
7	errors?
8	A. I mean, I haven't -- I haven't read those. So
9	I can't say either way.
10	Q. Well, you have read -- you have read those
11	transcripts, haven't you, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
12	A. Not -- not all of them. No.
13	Q. which of those transcripts have you read?
228388
14	A. I read portions of the Koballa.
15	Q. Now -- I'm sorry, I did not mean to interrupt
16	you.
17	A. That's okay. I read portions of the Koballa
18	transcript. That's -- those are the -- that's the one
19	I've read.
20	Q. And you did not submit an Errata sheet in the
21	Koballa case; is that correct?
22	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
23	deposition, I think, two times.
24	A. No. I didn't submit an Errata sheet.
25	BY MS. BROWN:
24
1	Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, are you taking any
2	medications today that you believe might affect your
3	ability to remember things?
4	A. No.
5	Q. Are you taking any medications today that you
6	believe might affect your ability to give truthful and
7	accurate testimony?
8	A. No.
9	MS. BROWN: I'd like to go ahead and mark as
10	Deposition Exhibit 1 the second re-notice of taking
11	videotape deposition and duces tecum.
12	(Exhibit No. 1 marked for identification.)
13	BY MS. BROWN:
14	Q. Thank you. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I am handing you
15	what's been marked Deposition Exhibit 1. That's the
16	second re-notice of taking video deposition duces tecum;
17	correct?
18	A. Yes. That's right.
19	Q. And it shows your name and today's date and the
20	location of the deposition; correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	Q. You've seen this before?
23	A. I have. Yes.
24	Q. And you mentioned earlier that you have
25	reviewed the schedule A; is that correct?
228388
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. Did you bring with you today any documents that
3	are responsive to the request in schedule A?
4	A. I did.
5	Q. And what documents are those?
6	A. I brought a copy of my curriculum vitae, which
7	is here. I've given this to you before, but I brought
8	another copy. And then I brought some photographs that
9	are, you know, part of my reliance documents.
10	Q. So you brought some photographs that are part
11	of your materials that go to your opinions in the Naugle
12	case; is that correct?
13	A. That's correct.
14	Q. Okay, we'll get to those later today. Now,
15	the date -- well, wait. Let's just take a look at the
16	schedule A for a second, if we could, if you turn,
17	Dr. Kyriakoudes, to page five, number 22: All written
18	communications of any form including, but not limited to
19	correspondence, e-mails and faxes, between you and your
20	assistants -- or your assistants and Robert Proctor
21	and/or his assistants pertaining to Engle Progeny
22	litigation.
23	MR. McPHARLlN: We filed an objection to that
24	request, that it was overly broad, harassing and
25	relevance as well.
26
1	BY MS. BROWN:
2	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, did you bring any documents
3	responsive to request number 22?
4	A. I did not.
5	Q. Do you have any correspondence or
6	communications, written communications, that would fall
7	within request number 22 that you had not previously
8	produced to defendants in this litigation?
9	A. Well, as I -- as I read this, I mean, yes, I
10	have communications between myself and Robert Proctor.
11	And as I understand number 22, this is basically asking
12	for all my communications with him. And I do have
13	communications with him, but I did not bring them.
14	Q. And when you read 22 to ask you for all your
15	communications, you consider all your communications
16	with Dr. Proctor to pertain to Engle Progeny litigation?
17	A. Oh, I see. I see. I missed that last phrase.
18	No. No. I have -- thank you for clarifying that. I
19	need to take my time and read these more carefully.
20	I -- I have an e-mail or I have some communications that
21	pertain to Engle Progeny litigation that I did not bring
22	with me.
23	Q. Okay, what are the dates of those
24	communications?
25	A. I don't know. I don't have -- I think I've got
27
1	one from sometime in the winter.
2	Q. And what was the subject matter of that
3	communication?
4	A. I think it was just a discussion of, you know,
5	what cases are coming out. I -- I don't have it with
6	me, so I can't recall exactly.
7	Q. That's an e-mail you could produce to us?
8	A. Yes. in the sense that it's -- yes. I mean, I
9	have it. Is that what you mean when you say produce?
Page 33
10	Q. Yeah. How come you did not bring that e-mail
11	with you to produce in response to request number 22?
12	MR. McPHARLlN: Because we objected to the --
13	to that particular request, as I said, as being
14	overly broad, harassing and asking for documents
15	that are not relevant to this deposition. Just as
16	you would, a witness who is obtained by the defense,
17	you object to requests all the time.
18	BY MS. BROWN:
19	Q. So, Dr. Kyriakoudes, do I understand that
20	Mr. McPharlin instructed you not to bring that e-mail
21	with you to this deposition today?
22	A. Yes. He explained to me that they -- as he
23	just mentioned, that they filed an objection against
24	that.
25	Q. Okay. Let's move on to number 23, which is:
28
1	All written communications in any form between you
2	and/or your assistants and Robert Proctor and/or his
3	assistants regarding the use of research assistants by
4	any defense witness in connection with Engle Progeny
5	litigation. Do you have any such written communications
6	that you have not previously produced to defendants in
7	the Engle Progeny litigation?
8	A. No. I've produced that to you.
9	Q. And so the universe of those materials would be
10	what? what's the universe of materials?
11	A. Oh, responsive to number 23?
12	Q. Yeah.
13	A. Well, that would be an e-mail attached to the
14	forwarding of the Greg Michel deposition, which I
15	produced. And then the two copy e-mails, which I
16	produced at the Koballa deposition.
17	Q. Other than those three e-mails, is it your
18	testimony that you do not have any additional
19	communications, written communications, with Dr. Proctor
20	related to the use of research assistants by any defense
21	witness --
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection.
23	BY MS. BROWN:
228388
24	Q. --in connection with this litigation?
25	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection. Previously asked in
29
1	multiple depositions multiple times.
2	BY MS. BROWN:
3	Q. You can answer, Dr. Kyriakoudes. He's going to
4	do that all day. So you can always answer when he's
5	done giving his speech.
6	A. Okay. Just trying to --
7	MR. MCPHARLIN: It's not a speech.
8	BY MS. BROWN:
9	Q. Unless he instructs you not to answer?
10	MR. mcpharlin: it's not a speech, Counsel. So
11	that's an inappropriate comment, it's an objection
12	and it's a statement that you're asking questions
13	outside the guidelines the court gave you.
14	A. Since we've had a bit of a --
15	MS. BROWN: Right. Madam court reporter, would
16	you mind reading back my last question.
17	(The question was read by the reporter.)
228388
18	A. That's correct.
19	BY MS. BROWN:
20	Q. Okay. And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, if you looked at
21	number 24, which asks you about written communications
22	between you, Robert Proctor, Dr. Betty Smocovitis and/or
23	any of your research -- or any of your assistants, other
24	than what we've just discussed you produced already, do
25	you have any additional written correspondence that
30
1	would satisfy request number 24?
2	A. No, I don't.
3	Q. Now, the date of the last e-mail you produced
4	from Dr. Proctor was dated June 8th; correct?
5	A. That sounds about right. I don't have it in
6	front of me, but that sounds about right.
7	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Previously asked.
8	BY MS. BROWN:
9	Q. And that would be one of the e-mails you
10	referenced just a minute ago that Dr. Proctor forwarded
11	to you; correct, or copied you on?
Page 37
12	A. That's correct.
13	Q. Now, have you had any e-mail communications
14	with Dr. Proctor since June 8th?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Have you had any e-mail communications with
17	Dr. Proctor since June 8th that relate to the Engle
18	Progeny litigation?
19	A. No.
20	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection. Previously asked.
21	You haven't asked maybe a handful -- a couple of
22	questions that were not previously asked. So go
23	ahead.
24	BY MS. BROWN:
25	Q. How many e-mail communications have you had
31
1	with Dr. Proctor since June 8th?
2	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
3	depositions multiple times.
4	A. One.
5	BY MS. BROWN:
6	Q. And what was the subject matter of that e-mail?
7	MR. MCPHARLIN: No. Dr. Proctor -- I mean,
8	Dr. Kyriakoudes, that's it. That question has been
9	asked in multiple depositions and you know it. Are
10	you saying -- are you representing on the record
11	that that question has never been asked?
12	MS. BROWN: What e-mail he's exchanged? I do
13	not recall.
14	MR. MCPHARLIN: The subject of the e-mail.
15	That --
16	MS. BROWN: I do not recall that. But, Todd,
17	we are not having this back and forth. I mean, I am
18	going to have my two hours. We're going to subtract
19	your lengthy objections from that time and then
20	we'll have to take this up with Judge Streitfeld.
21	And unfortunately we'll have to bring
22	Dr. Kyriakoudes back.
23	MR. MCPHARLIN: You represented to the judge --
24	MS. BROWN: That I would not re-plow old
25	ground.
1	MR. MCPHARLIN: No. That you would not ask
2	questions that have already been asked. That
3	question has already been asked. So, Professor, I
4	am going to instruct you not to answer that
5	question. I am going to ask you to stick within the
6	guidelines of the representations that you made to
7	the court.
8	BY MS. BROWN:
9	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, what is the date of the e-mail
10	you're thinking of that you have with Dr. Proctor since
11	June 8th?
12	A. I don't know the exact date, but it's been
13	within the last week.
14	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, have you been deposed in the
15	last week?
16	A. No.
17	Q. Okay. So back to my earlier question,
18	Dr. Kyriakoudes. what was the subject matter of the
19	e-mail that you received from Dr. Proctor within the
20	last week?
21	A. The subject matter was related to our -- our
22	common research interest on the history of smoking and
23	the history of the tobacco industry.
24	Q. And was this an e-mail related to your upcoming
25	conference that you're presenting at together?
33
1	A. No. it wasn't relevant to that. No.
2	Q. In this e-mail, did you discuss your testimony
3	in any of the Engle Progeny litigation?
4	A. No.
5	Q. in this e-mail, did Dr. Proctor -- well, first
6	of all, was this an e-mail from Dr. Proctor to you?
7	A. That's correct.
8	Q. Did you respond to his e-mail?
9	A. No.
10	Q. In the e-mail from Dr. Proctor, did he make any
11	reference to any issues related to the university of
12	Florida matter?
13	A. No.
14	Q. Did he make any reference to any of his recent
15	testimony related to the University of Florida matter?
16	A. None whatsoever.
17	Q. And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, when I say the University
18	of Florida matter, do you understand that to be
19	referring to Dr. Proctor's contact with Professor
20	Smocovitis related to the research assistants that were
21	being employed by Greg Michel?
22	A. Yes. That's how I understand it.
23	Q. Now, you've previously testified about a
24	telephone conversation you had with Dr. Proctor on
25	August 21st; correct?
34
1	A. Prior, yes. Yeah. That is right.
2	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked.
3	BY MS. BROWN:
4	Q. Have you had any communications with
5	Dr. Proctor, phone call? we talked about this e-mail.
6	So putting aside this e-mail, any other form of
228388
7	communications with Dr. Proctor since that date,
8	August 21st?
9	A. Yeah, we talked on the phone.
10	Q. And when did you talk to Dr. Proctor on the
11	phone?
12	A. Last week.
13	Q. what was the date of that?
14	A. I don't remember the exact date, but you could
15	discover the date because I spoke to him the day that he
16	was written up in a -- in a newspaper called the
17	Chronicle of Higher Education.
18	Q. And who initiated that call?
19	A. He called me. And then I returned his call
20	because I didn't get the initial call.
21	Q. And what was the subject matter of that call?
22	A. He said that he was in the paper and he wanted
23	to alert me to that fact.
24	Q. How long was that call?
25	A. Maybe -- maybe 15 minutes, 20 minutes. Not
1	long.
2	Q. During that call, did you discuss your
3	testimony or his testimony in the Engle Progeny
4	litigation?
5	A. No.
6	Q. Did you discuss any issues related to the
7	University of Florida matter?
8	A. No.
9	Q. Okay. Other than the e-mail in the last week
10	and the phone call last week, any other communications
11	you've had with Dr. Proctor since August 21st?
12	A. None.
13	Q. Now, you were last deposed on October 1st in
14	the Hibner case; is that correct?
15	A. That's correct.
16	Q. Since that date, have you communicated, in any
17	manner, with plaintiff's counsel in the Engel Progeny
18	cases about your knowledge of or involvement in
19	Dr. Proctor's contact with the University of Florida
20	regarding graduate students working for Dr. Michel?
21	A. If you count a phone -- well, the one phone
22	call I had was after that deposition, that evening, I
23	spoke with the attorney that defended that deposition, a
24	Mr. Michael Quinn. That would be it.
25	Q. And what was your conversation with Mr. Quinn?
36
1	A. it was about -- about that deposition.
2	Q. And what about that deposition?
3	A. Well, as you know, it was an intimidating
4	experience and I ended that deposition. So it was about
5	that process.
6	Q. it was about the process of ending the
7	deposition?
8	A. Well, he called me to tell me that that -- that
9	he thought that the behavior of the attorneys in that
10	deposition was outrageous and that I did the right thing
11	in ending the deposition after I had been accused of
12	lying by one of the attorneys that were asking me
13	questions.
14	Q. Now, this would be questions related to whether
15	answers you had given in response to questions in the
Page 45
16	Koballa deposition were false?
17	MR. MCPHARLIN: Object to the form.
18	A. Well, the questions were the questions. I
19	mean, I don't have that -- that -- I don't have that
20	testimony before me. I mean, the questions are the
21	questions that they were asking me.
22	BY MS. BROWN:
23	Q. And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, at that deposition nobody
24	called you a liar; correct?
25	MR. MCPHARLIN: Object to the form.
37
1	A. They didn't use exactly that language. They
2	said that I was lying. I also overheard, while I was
3	out of the room, coming back from the bathroom, one of
4	the attorneys tell Mr. Quinn that -- that he thought I
5	was lying. I heard that as I was coming in just as I
6	stood outside the door.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. And was this when you ended your deposition?
9	A. Well, I came back in -- I mean, you can read
10	the record. That's going to be a much more accurate
11	reflection of what happened than -- than my memory of
12	that very stressful period of time. But my recollection
13	is, I came back in, we answered more questions and then
14	when I felt that I was being harassed, intimidated and
15	accused of lying, that -- that I made the decision to
16	stop the deposition.
17	Q. And you made this decision to stop the
18	deposition when you were asked whether a question and
19	answer you gave to a question in the deposition was
20	false; correct?
21	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form.
22	A. I'd have to, you know -- I mean, you can read
23	the record. The record is going to be more accurate
24	than my recollection. But, you know, so that says what
25	it says. I recall what I just answered a minute ago.
38
1	BY MS. BROWN:
2	Q. Now, earlier when we were talking about e-mail
228388
3	correspondence with Dr. Proctor, you referenced your
4	e-mail transmitting Dr. Michelle's transcript to
5	Dr. Proctor; correct?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. And just so the record is complete, let me make
8	sure we're talking about the same e-mail.
9	MS. BROWN: Let's mark this as the next
10	deposition exhibit.
11	(Exhibit No. 2 marked for identification.)
12	BY MS. BROWN:
13	Q. That is Deposition Exhibit No. 2; is that
14	correct, Dr. Kyriakoudes?
15	A. Yes. That's correct.
16	Q. Could you identify what that is.
17	A. This is an e-mail that I forwarded that I
18	received from an attorney named David Sales and I
19	forwarded it to Dr. Proctor.
20	Q. Now, did Mr. Sales, at any point in time, ask
21	you to forward that transcript on to Dr. Proctor?
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: That's been asked in previous
23	depositions.
228388
24	A. No, he did not.
25	BY MS. BROWN:
39
1	Q. And had Dr. Proctor made any requests to you to
2	forward him that transcript upon your receipt?
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
4	deposition.
5	A. No. He didn't ask for me to send it.
6	BY MS. BROWN:
7	Q. And did you receive a response from Dr. Proctor
8	to that e-mail?
9	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
10	depositions.
11	A. No, I did not.
12	MR. MCPHARLIN: You agree these questions have
13	been asked previously; right?
14	BY MS. BROWN:
15	Q. But you did eventually hear from Dr. Proctor as
16	a result of your forwarding that transcript to him;
17	correct?
18	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Objection to
19	previously asked in prior depositions. You are
20	rehashing all ground that has been covered before,
21	Ms. Brown. Are you telling -- are you making a
22	representation that that question has never been
23	asked? He's never been asked if Dr. Proctor
24	responded to that -- to that e-mail? is that the
25	representation you're making, because those were the
40
1	guidelines that you were given. And you told the
2	judge that you wouldn't ask a question that's
3	already been asked. So if you're representing on
4	the record that that question has never been asked,
5	go ahead and ask it. is that what you're doing?
6	BY MS. BROWN:
7	Q. There came a time, Dr. Kyriakoudes, when
8	Dr. Proctor did send you an e-mail related to
9	Dr. Michelle's transcript; correct?
10	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
228388
11	depositions. You agree with that, too; right?
12	BY MS. BROWN:
13	Q. You can answer the question that's pending,
14	Dr. Kyriakoudes.
15	A. And just so that you're clear, I'm just making
16	sure that everybody, you know -- you know, takes care of
17	what they need to say. Yes. I did receive
18	communications subsequent to this e-mail.
19	Q. From Dr. Proctor; correct?
20	A. Yeah. From Dr. Proctor. That's right.
21	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
22	depositions.
23	MS. BROWN: And, again, so the record is
24	complete and we all know what e-mail we're talking
25	about, let's mark this -- let's mark this just so
41
1	it's consistent with the prior transcripts. I think
2	you talked about this e-mail. Let's mark this as
3	Exhibit 9 to the deposition.
4	(Exhibit No. 9 marked for identification.)
5	BY MS. BROWN:
6	Q. And, Dr. Kyriakoudes, I am handing you what's
7	been marked as Exhibit 9 to this deposition; correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	Q. And can you identify, for the record, what this
10	is.
11	A. This is an e-mail that was forwarded to me by
12	Robert Proctor.
13	Q. And when you received this e-mail, you reviewed
14	it; correct?
15	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
16	depositions. Professor Kyriakoudes, don't answer
17	that question. You're asking him -- you're just
18	repeating the depositions that have already been
19	taken.
20	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, I don't understand
21	the need to continue to explain this to you, but I
22	will take the time to do it one more time, although
23	we can excise this from the two hours. And that is,
24	there are questions I am going to need to ask
25	Dr. Kyriakoudes that relate to his prior testimony.
1	in fact, it's memorialized in the judge's order
2	that, in fact, I can take this two hours to inquire
3	about Dr. Kyriakoudes's prior testimony.
4	in order to do that, I need to lay some
5	foundation leading up to the questions I need to ask
6	him. I'm going to do it on this e-mail. I'm going
7	to do it on the next e-mail. Because in order to
8	ask him about prior testimony, it should come as no
9	surprise that I am going to need to reference the
10	prior testimony.
11	MR. McPHARLlN: You don't need to lay a
12	foundation. You can ask him your questions. You
13	told the judge that you wouldn't ask him a question
14	that's already been asked. He granted your motion,
15	and specifically stated on the record based on your
16	representation as an officer of the court, that you
17	won't ask a question that's already been asked, I am
18	going to go ahead and grant it. That's what he
19	said. So you don't need to lay a foundation. Ask
Page 53
20	him your questions.
21	MS. BROWN: I need to lay a foundation. And,
22	Mr. McPharlin, this is my deposition. I will lay
23	the foundation I think is necessary.
24	MR. MCPHARLIN: Well, I've instructed him not
25	to answer that question because that question has
43
1	been asked multiple times. So you can move on to
2	the next question so we are not wasting time.
3	BY MS. BROWN:
4	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, when you read this e-mail on
5	May 23rd, what parts of this e-mail did you read?
6	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
7	depositions. Don't answer that.
8	MS. BROWN: You're instructing him not to
9	answer that question?
10	MR. mcpharlin: You've asked him, ad nauseam,
11	about this e-mail. And you're just -- correct? How
12	many depositions have been taken on that e-mail?
13	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, I am lost. Are you
14	objecting to something or are you questioning me
15	now?
16	MR. MCPHARLIN: I am objecting to you telling
17	the judge that you won't ask him questions that have
18	already been asked and then you coming in here today
19	and doing exactly what you told the judge you
20	wouldn't do.
21	BY MS. BROWN:
22	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes --
23	MR. MCPHARLIN: That is what I have an
24	objection to.
25	BY MS. BROWN:
44
1	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, when you reviewed this e-mail
2	on May 23rd, what was your understanding of what
3	Dr. Proctor was doing with respect to the research
4	assistants that worked for Dr. Michel?
5	A. I didn't get that far into the e-mail. I -- it
6	didn't seem to require -- I read the opening line and
228388
7	didn't seem to require any action on my part, so I
8	skipped it. I did not review it any farther -- any
9	further.
10	Q. So you read the line that says: FYI, my recent
11	exchange with Professor Betty Smocovitis at the UF
12	Florida -- University of Florida, a history of silence
13	colleague, note her astonishment. That's what you read?
14	A. Well, no. I read the subject line, spreading
15	the word. I probably looked at that first sentence, but
16	then -- then moved on. Because it clearly didn't
17	require any -- it was not an actionable e-mail that
18	required me to do something. And so it didn't seem to
19	be of any interest to me.
20	Q. And what was your understanding of -- or what
21	is your understanding of what Dr. Proctor hoped to
22	accomplish by contacting the University of Florida about
23	the research assistants being employed by Dr. Michel?
24	MR. McPHARLlN: Professor, don't answer that
25	question. You're -- you're doing exactly what was
1	done in several prior depositions, what did Proctor
2	understand? what did Dr. Proctor understand? what
3	was Proctor trying to do? What was Dr. Proctor
4	trying to accomplish? You're not -- you're
5	re-plowing ground exactly like you said you wouldn't
6	do.
7	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, I disagree with you.
8	And if you can point to me in a transcript where
9	that precise question was asked, and Dr. Kyriakoudes
10	answered it, then perhaps we can move on. But
11	unless you can do that, we're going to continue with
12	the questioning that I'm asking.
13	MR. MCPHARLIN: Okay. Continue. But I've
14	already instructed him on that question. That
15	question has been asked.
16	MS. BROWN: Okay. Mr. McPharlin, you do
17	understand that we're going to end up in front of
18	Judge Streitfeld on another motion to compel.
19	MR. MCPHARLIN: I understand. I understand
20	what you told the judge. I understand what you said
21	to the judge.
22	MS. BROWN: I understand what I told the judge,
23	too, Mr. McPharlin, which is that it was not my
24	intent to re-plow old ground. Now, I mean, one of
25	the situations we have is that, depending on which
46
1	transcript and which deposition Dr. Kyriakoudes is
2	sitting for, the answers tend to change. So there
3	are some things I'm going to have to ask him about.
4	MR. MCPHARLIN: I already gave him my
5	instruction. Because I -- I can see from your line
6	of questioning that you intend to abuse this process
7	by asking him repeatedly questions that have already
8	been asked despite what you told the judge. So
9	that's what's happening here. So go ahead.
10	BY MS. BROWN:
11	Q. Did you respond to Dr. Proctor, whether in
12	writing or verbally, with respect to Exhibit 9, this
13	e-mail that was received on May 23rd?
14	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
228388
15	depositions. But go ahead, Professor.
16	A. No, I didn't.
17	BY MS. BROWN:
18	Q. And at any point have you discussed with
19	Dr. Proctor your feelings about the appropriateness of
20	his contact with Betty Smocovitis related to the grad
21	assistants used by Dr. Michel or employed by Dr. Michel?
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked. Go ahead,
23	Professor.
24	A. No.
25	BY MS. BROWN:
47
1	Q. But you have told us that you don't approve of
2	what he did; correct?
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in multiple
4	depositions.
5	A. That's not accurate. A number of hypotheticals
6	were represented to me in the Barbanell deposition. I
7	don't know if those things have happened or not, but I
8	responded to those hypotheticals. I believe it was
228388
9	Ms. Case over the phone that was asking me the
10	questions. And you can go back to my testimony. My
11	position is still the same on that.
12	BY MS. BROWN:
13	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, are you telling us that even
14	as you sit here today, you don't know what Dr. Proctor
15	did in relation to contacting Betty Smocovitis in
16	relation to the grad students employed by Dr. Michel?
17	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form.
18	A. What I'm saying is that you -- and I mean you
19	collectively -- discussed a series of representations or
20	hypothetical representations of activities. I don't
21	know that any of those activities either were intended
22	to be accomplished or actually happened. So I don't
23	know about that.
24	BY MS. BROWN:
25	Q. So, Dr. Kyriakoudes, we did not have your
48
1	e-mails at the time of your Barbanell deposition;
2	correct?
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection.
4	A. That's correct.
5	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form. Hold on.
6	BY MS. BROWN:
7	Q. You had not produced those to us; correct?
8	MR. McPharlin: Listen, as a professional
9	courtesy, if I am going to make an objection, I'd
10	like for you to stop so I can make my objection for
11	the record, so we're not talking over each other
12	because that is discourteous to the court reporter
13	and it's not going to sound very good on the video.
14	Okay. So I am going object. That's been previously
15	asked in prior depositions. But go ahead,
16	Professor.
17	MS. BROWN: Madam court reporter, could you
18	read back my question, please.
19	(The question was read by the reporter.)
20	A. That's right. You did not have these e-mails
21	at that time.
22	BY MS. BROWN:
23	Q. And that was because you had not produced those
Page 61
24	to us; is that correct?
25	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
49
1	depositions. Professor, don't answer that question.
2	That's been asked in just about three depositions
3	multiple times.
4	BY MS. BROWN:
5	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, we're no longer talking about
6	hypotheticals; correct?
7	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to the form. Vague.
8	A. Well, I don't know what -- tell me what you're
9	talking about and then I can respond.
10	BY MS. BROWN:
11	Q. well, we now know, based on the e-mails that
12	you produced two months after the Barbanell deposition,
13	that Dr. Proctor did, in fact, contact Betty Smocovitis
14	at the University of Florida; correct?
15	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection. Previously asked in
16	prior depositions. Don't answer that.
17	MS. BROWN: You're advising him not to answer
18	that question?
19	MR. McPHARLlN: Are you representing -- read
20	the question back, please, madam court reporter.
21	(The question was read by the reporter.)
22	MR. McPHARLlN: Are you representing on this
23	record that he's never been asked whether he knows
24	that Dr. Proctor contacted Professor Smocovitis at
25	the University of Florida? Is that what you're
50
1	representing on the record?
2	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, the way we started
3	down this road was that Dr. Kyriakoudes took us back
4	to hypotheticals being posed in the Barbanell
5	deposition.
6	MR. MCPHARLIN: Listen --
7	MS. BROWN: This is another foundational
8	question that we're not talking about hypotheticals.
9	We are now talking about what Dr. Kyriakoudes
10	actually knows based on the e-mails he's received.
11	MR. MCPHARLIN: You can call them foundational
12	questions. They are questions that have been
13	previously asked multiple times in multiple
14	depositions. And I am holding you to your
15	representations to the court and what -- and the
16	guidelines you were given. So if you're making --
17	if you're making a representation as an officer of
18	the court that he's never been asked that question
19	and answered that question, then go ahead and ask
20	him. But you're going to make the representation as
21	an officer of the court on the record.
22	MS. BROWN: I told you it's a foundational
23	question.
24	MR. MCPHARLIN: I'm not -- but I'm -- listen.
25	MS. BROWN: We're not going to continue to
51
1	dispute this, Mr. McPharlin.
2	MR. MCPHARLIN: Okay.
3	MR. KEANE: Show my objection to the form also.
4	BY MS. BROWN:
5	Q. Prior to your deposition in the Koballa case,
6	how many times had you reviewed the e-mail that's been
7	marked as Exhibit No. 9?
8	A. Once.
9	Q. And when did you review that e-mail that one
10	time?
11	A. I don't know exactly when. I don't know -- I
12	don't know exactly when I reviewed it. I mean, I just
13	don't recollect that. But it would have been whenever I
14	initially clicked on it, looked at the header and made
15	the decision that it wasn't anything that was important
16	for me.
17	Q. Now, prior to your August 24, 2009 deposition
18	in the Koballa case, it's your testimony that you didn't
19	re-review that e-mail?
20	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
21	A. Well, I later found it when I was searching. I
22	mean, I've -- I've described this process. I later
23	discovered it in looking for the e-mail that is marked
24	Exhibit No. 2 here today, and I found that one and
25	another one. And those are the ones that I produced at
Page 65
1	the Koballa deposition. So, I mean, that would have
2	been the second time that I looked at it.
3	BY MS. BROWN:
4	Q. How did you go about conducting your search for
5	those e-mails?
6	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
7	depositions. Go ahead, Professor.
8	A. I searched on I think -- I think -- I don't
9	even recall exactly, but I think what was searched on
10	Proctor, you know, in my Google window.
11	BY MS. BROWN:
12	Q. And do you have a sent box where e-mails that
13	you send are stored in your e-mail?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. And then you have an inbox where e-mails that
16	you receive are stored; is that correct?
17	A. Well, that's not exactly how Google mail works.
18	Google mail lists conversations in groups. So you
228388
19	actually don't have to use a sent -- or it doesn't
20	divide the mail into inbox or outbox, but rather it
21	keeps it together in a string.
22	Q. What if you receive no reply to your e-mail.
23	Does it still show up as some part of the string?
24	A. Well, then it -- if you send out an e-mail to
25	which you receive no reply, it's a string of one.
53
1	Q. And it all shows up in the same box?
2	A. That's correct.
3	Q. Now, you said that you received other e-mails
4	from Dr. Proctor; correct?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. And there are occasions where you received
7	several e-mails in a month, depending on what's going on
8	with your relationship with Dr. Proctor; correct?
9	A. On a variety of subjects.
10	Q. So when you went to search for Proctor in your
11	e-mail box, how many e-mails came up?
12	A. Not many. And I don't recall exactly how many,
13	but not many.
14	Q. And did you go through each e-mail that came up
15	to see if, in fact, those e-mails related in any way to
16	this issue of the university of Florida grad students?
17	A. Well, these were the ones that came up right --
18	right initially in the search. And so that's -- so they
19	did -- they came right up at the top.
20	Q. is that because these were the most recent
21	e-mails you had received or sent related to Dr. Proctor?
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
23	A. That may have been the case. I can't say for
24	sure. I mean -- but that -- that may well have been the
25	case. Yes.
54
1	BY MS. BROWN:
2	Q. Did you scroll through all the e-mails that
3	showed up with Dr. Proctor to see if there was anything
4	else related to these issues?
5	A. Yes.
6	Q. Now, you were looking for the e-mail that you
Page 68
7	sent to Dr. Proctor forwarding Dr. Michelle's
8	transcript; correct?
9	A. That's right.
10	Q. And why were you doing that?
11	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Previously asked in
12	prior depositions multiple times.
13	A. I was asked by a defense attorney to do that.
14	BY MS. BROWN:
15	Q. Was that at the Grossman deposition?
16	A. That's correct.
17	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
18	depositions.
19	BY MS. BROWN:
20	Q. So a defense attorney at the Grossman
21	deposition asked you if you would produce to them in
22	Grossman a copy of your e-mail transmitting
23	Dr. Michelle's transcript to Dr. Proctor; correct?
24	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Previously asked in
25	prior depositions.
1	A. That's correct. And, you know, as I sit here,
2	you know, you asked me about searching and I'm looking
3	at the spelling of Dr. Michelle's name, which is, you
4	know, an uncommon spelling. To be honest with you, I
5	may have -- I may have searched on Michel in looking for
6	those e-mails. I really don't recall either way. But
7	it is quite possible that I put in Michel into the
8	search box. So I'd have to, you know, clarify that --
9	that prior answer in that regard.
10	BY MS. BROWN:
11	Q. So it's possible that you've received
12	additional e-mails from Dr. Proctor related to this
13	issue that didn't specifically reference Dr. Michel;
14	correct?
15	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form. Assumes
16	facts not in evidence.
17	A. No. I don't have any other e-mails related to
18	this issue from Dr. Proctor.
19	BY MS. BROWN:
20	Q. Well, if you've only searched on Dr. Michelle's
228388
21	name, how can you be sure of that?
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
23	Mischaracterization.
24	A. I'm just -- you had asked me about my initial
25	search for this. I've looked -- these are the only ones
56
1	that I have -- that I have that related to this issue.
2	And I gave them to you.
3	BY MS. BROWN:
4	Q. And I'm asking you how you can be sure of that.
5	MR. mcpharlin: Objection to form. Asked and
6	answered.
7	A. Well, I mean, I searched my e-mail.
8	BY MS. BROWN:
9	Q. Did you run another search using Proctor's
10	name?
11	A. I may have. You know, I just don't recall.
12	it's -- it's been a few months. I just don't recall.
13	Q. So it's possible that you only picked up
14	e-mails that had Dr. Michelle's name referenced in
15	them --
16	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form.
17	BY MS. BROWN:
18	Q. -- related to this issue; correct?
19	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to the form. Asked
20	and answered. Mischaracterization.
21	A. No. I'm -- I'm confident that I searched for
22	everything and given you everything related to this
23	issue.
24	BY MS. BROWN:
25	Q. Other than that one search where you may have
57
1	used Dr. Michelle's name as your search term, have you
2	conducted any other searches of your e-mail to see what
3	you have related to these issues?
4	A. Yeah. I mean, yes, I have. And I've given you
5	what I have.
6	Q. when did you do your second search for these
7	e-mails?
8	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form.
Page 72
9	A. It would have been certainly sometime prior to
10	the Koballa deposition.
11	BY MS. BROWN:
12	Q. Remind me when you did the first search with
13	Michel as your search term.
14	A. Well, let's be clear. I'm not recalling
15	exactly, you know, how I did it. I may have done both.
16	I just -- I'm just telling you that I don't have a hard
17	and fast recollection of that. So you've taken that and
18	you're kind of running with that. But be careful of
19	what I actually said.
20	Q. Well, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you said you may have
21	used Michel instead of Proctor; correct?
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form. Asked and
23	answered.
24	A. Right. I am not exactly recalling, but --
25	BY MS. BROWN:
1	Q. Right.
2	A. -- I feel confident that I've given you what I
3	had --
4	Q. Right.
5	A. -- in my e-mail box related to this issue.
6	Q. Okay. To go back to my question, when is it
7	that you ran your first search for these e-mails?
8	MR. MCPHARLIN: That was previously asked in
9	prior depositions multiple times. Professor, don't
10	answer that.
11	A. He's right.
12	BY MS. BROWN:
13	Q. And you said that you did that search in order
14	to produce the transmittal e-mail in the Grossman case;
15	correct?
16	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
17	depositions. Professor, don't answer that.
18	BY MS. BROWN:
19	Q. Did you, in fact, produce the e-mail
20	transmitting Dr. Michelle's transcript to Dr. Proctor to
21	the attorneys in the Grossman case?
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
23	depositions.
24	A. Did I ever actually forward it to them? I may
25	not have. I can't recall. I think I did -- I did
59
1	produce it at a -- at a subsequent deposition.
2	BY MS. BROWN:
3	Q. Did you produce it to Mr. Hammer and
4	Mr. Udanski, the attorneys representing the plaintiff in
5	the Grossman case?
6	A. No.
7	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
8	depositions.
9	BY MS. BROWN:
10	Q. Did you produce it to -- let me see if I can
11	pull up the name of the attorney from R.J. Reynolds who
12	questioned you about it at the Grossman case.
13	A. You want me to help you?
14	Q. Yeah. If you recall his name, that would be
15	very helpful. Mr. Carter, is that it?
16	A. Oh, well, I guess I can't be helpful. That's
17	not the one I recall.
18	Q. I believe Ed Carter questioned you about that
19	at the Grossman deposition. He represented R.J.
20	Reynolds.
21	A. Did he appear over the telephone? That's
22	probably why I don't remember.
23	Q. He may have. I can't tell you that.
24	A. No. I didn't -- I didn't give it to him.
25	Q. But you did your search with the intent to find
60
1	that e-mail to produce in the Grossman case; correct?
2	A. Yes. It -- I remembered in -- you know, after
3	I had come back from vacation sometime in July that they
4	had mentioned that. I looked for it. I've described
5	that process previously and assumed that, you know, if
6	they really wanted it, they would have asked -- you
7	know, asked for it or, you know, made an attempt to
8	follow up or something like that.
9	Q. Well, they did ask you for it at the Grossman
10	deposition; correct?
11	MR. mcpharlin: Asked and answered multiple
12	times and in previous depositions.
13	A. Yes. They did ask for it.
14	BY MS. BROWN:
15	Q. And you went looking for it in order to produce
16	it in Grossman?
17	MR. MCPHARLIN: Professor, don't answer that.
18	That's been asked and answered, not only in this
19	deposition, but in others as well.
20	BY MS. BROWN:
21	Q. So, Dr. Kyriakoudes, why did you not, once you
22	located these e-mails, produce them to counsel in the
23	Grossman case?
24	MR. MCPHARLIN: Professor, don't answer that.
25	That has been previously asked in prior depositions.
61
1	Ms. Brown, are you representing on the record that
2	that has never been asked in any prior deposition?
3	MS. BROWN: Why after doing a search in the --
4	for purposes of the Grossman case he did not produce
5	them in the Grossman case?
6	MR. McPHARLlN: why he didn't produce?
7	MS. BROWN: That is the question that is being
8	asked and that is the question I want an answer to.
9	MR. MCPHARLIN: Okay. Go ahead.
10	BY MS. BROWN:
11	Q. So, Dr. Kyriakoudes, just --
12	MR. McPHARLlN: it's been previously asked, but
13	go ahead.
14	BY MS. BROWN:
15	Q. -- just to be clear, after doing a search for
16	purposes of locating the e-mail requested of you in the
17	Grossman case, why did you not then produce the e-mails
18	you located in the Grossman case?
19	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked. But go
20	ahead.
21	A. I just didn't think to do it. I was very busy,
22	a lot going on. it didn't seem to be a big deal to me.
23	So it didn't seem to be important, you know, and not
24	something that I needed to follow up on.
25	BY MS. BROWN:
1	Q. You didn't think these e-mails from Dr. Proctor
2	to Professor Smocovitis at the University of Florida
3	encouraging her to out these graduate students as
4	working for the tobacco industry was a big deal?
5	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
6	MR. KEANE: Objection to the form of the
7	question.
8	A. Well, you asked me -- you know, we're talking
9	about a different e-mail, we're talking about this
10	forwarding e-mail that was asked for in the Grossman
11	case. I just didn't think that was a big deal.
12	BY MS. BROWN:
13	Q. Well, maybe I misunderstood you,
14	Dr. Kyriakoudes. Clarify for me, when you searched for
15	this e-mail, this transmittal e-mail, was it as part of
16	that search that you turned up the other two e-mails?
17	A. That's correct.
18	Q. And so my question to you was, why didn't you
19	produce all three e-mails to counsel in the Grossman
20	case?
21	A. I just didn't think to do it. I don't, you
22	know -- I just didn't think to do it. I didn't think it
23	was a big deal.
24	Q. And, again, back to my prior question. You
25	didn't think it was a big deal that Dr. Proctor was
63
1	contacting Professor Smocovitis at the university of
2	Florida in an effort to get her to talk to the faculty
3	or the advisors of these graduate students related to
4	the research they're doing?
5	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
6	A. Well, now that's -- you know, that's a
7	different situation than what was represented to me in
8	the first Barbanell case, which I testified. Based on
9	what I know now from this -- this e-mail, I don't see
10	anything -- I don't see anything wrong with this. You
11	know, you're asking me a question about Dr. Proctor's
12	behavior, there's nothing wrong with discussing this
Page 80
13	issue. Academia operates on openness. I mean, that's
14	how -- that's how we operate.
15	BY MS. BROWN:
16	Q. So, Dr. Kyriakoudes, do you approve of
17	Dr. Proctor's conduct in contacting the University of
18	Florida Professor?
19	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Previously asked in
20	prior depositions. Don't answer that, Professor.
21	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, I think
22	Dr. Kyriakoudes has taken a position very different
23	than one he's taken in prior depositions, which is
24	exactly the reason why we need to ask these
25	questions. So I'm entitled to clarify his position
64
1	is different than it's been in prior depositions.
2	MR. McPHARLlN: You just asked him if he
3	approves of what he did. That has been covered, ad
4	nauseam, to a ridiculous level in prior depositions.
5	So if you're telling me that that question has never
6	been asked, whether he approves it or not, that's
7	the representation you're making on the record,
8	fine.
9	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, this is the first
10	time Dr. Kyriakoudes has said he doesn't think this
11	is any big deal. I mean, like you, I read the prior
12	deposition testimony that suggests Dr. Kyriakoudes
13	thought this was a significant deal, and frankly,
14	didn't approve of Dr. Proctor's conduct. But if now
15	Dr. Kyriakoudes feels differently, we're entitled to
16	know that. So I would like my question read back to
17	Dr. Kyriakoudes. Nora, would you mind reading back
18	my question.
19	(The question was read by the reporter.)
20	MR. KEANE: Object to the form of the question.
21	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked multiple
22	times.
23	A. First of all, let's be clear about conduct,
24	what you mean, because I think we have different
25	definitions of what that word indicates and the actions
1	that lay behind it. Many -- and my opinion has not
2	changed since I was asked about this in Barbanell. I
3	was very clear in that -- in that case in pointing out
4	that graduate assistants who are simply trying to make
5	some extra money and doing low-level research, reading
6	microfilm or photocopying articles for professors,
7	there's nothing -- there's no problem with that. I have
8	no problem with that. And I was quite explicit about
9	that in the Barbanell.
10	But I did say in the Barbanell case that -- I
11	am paraphrasing because I don't have the exact words in
12	front of me -- but if it's the case that the students
13	were not fully informed of the larger context of what
14	they were doing -- I didn't use exactly those word in
15	the Barbanell case, but that was my meaning -- that is a
16	problem.
17	There's nothing secret about this process.
18	Everything is written down and these depositions are
19	available. They're public documents. And if a -- if a
20	graduate student isn't fully informed -- and I don't
21	know what the situation is, because I don't know. All I
22	know is from this limited piece of information here.
23	But if -- if any student is not fully informed of the
24	full context of what they're doing, whom they're working
25	for, that there is a problem with that.
66
1	And so simply contacting a colleague about this
2	issue, there's nothing wrong with this. I mean, he
3	contacts a colleague and he gives his view as to the
4	content of the experts and their testimony, which he has
5	published and which I have published, so those are not
6	unknown opinions.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, if I could direct your
9	attention to Exhibit No. 9, the opinion after the third
10	or fourth paragraph that begins: The only faculty
11	member I know about from your department. Do you see
12	that?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. Now, toward the end of that paragraph, he says:
Page 84
15	In my view, this is historical malpractice; correct?
16	A. Yes.
17	Q. And this is referencing what comes earlier in
18	that paragraph; correct: Dr. Michelle's assignment to
19	read all Pensacola papers from the 1950's and succeeding
20	decades to find examples of smoking and health stories
21	which smokers have been exposed.
22	A. Yes.
23	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
24	BY MS. BROWN:
25	Q. So you would characterize that,
67
1	Dr. Kyriakoudes, as Dr. Proctor merely contacting a
2	colleague to raise that issue?
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection. Argumentative.
4	A. Well, now, let's read this fairly and
5	accurately. He goes on to say: The argument -- the
6	argument is then made in court that only an ostrich or a
7	moron could have failed to realize that cigarettes cause
228388
8	death and injury, so plaintiffs don't deserve
9	compensation. Then he goes on to say: In my view this
10	is historical malpractice.
11	And then he says: I would be very interested
12	to know if the advisors of these students know what they
13	have been doing. The historical malpractice meaning,
14	that is attached to the opinions that the defense
15	experts give in court. That's what Mr. Proctor is -- is
16	saying. And I think you misrepresented when you leave
17	out that critical -- you skip over that sentence as you
18	read this into the record. That's -- that's what he's
19	referring to. He's published on this in peer-review
20	journals. There's nothing secret about that.
21	BY MS. BROWN:
22	Q. Well, Dr. Kyriakoudes, let's cut to the chase.
23	Are you telling me you don't read these e-mails to
24	suggest that Dr. Proctor was disparaging the conduct of
25	graduate students in history who would perform this kind
1	of research?
228388
2	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Argumentative.
3	Speculation.
4	A. That judgment is not supported by this e-mail.
5	That characterization of what you just said is not
6	supported by this e-mail. That's all I can say about
7	that.
8	BY MS. BROWN:
9	Q. So you read this e-mail, Dr. Proctor was merely
10	raising an issue to Professor Smocovitis and, what?
11	Encouraging the grad students to keep up the good work?
12	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form.
13	Argumentative. Speculation.
14	MR. KEANE: Objection to the form of the
15	question.
16	A. He says right here: I would be very interested
17	to know if the advisors of these students know what they
18	have been doing. And that is indicating a sense of
19	openness. Now, I was very -- you know, you're asking me
20	questions which you've basically asked me before. I was
21	quite explicit in Barbanell when you asked me about
22	this. And I -- and to summarize that, I talked about
23	the special position of trust between graduate students
24	and their advisors, the desire for students engaged in
25	this activity, for which I see no -- and still agree
69
1	that there's nothing wrong with this.
2	BY MS. BROWN:
3	Q. And this being the research assistants'
4	activity; correct?
5	A. Yes. Absolutely. I myself use research
6	assistants. There's nothing -- nothing wrong with that.
7	But issues of openness and trust, which I described in
8	Barbanell, again, totally in this hypothetical
9	discussion, are relevant within -- in this context.
10	Q. And I assume that you abide by your prior
11	testimony after the Barbanell deposition, that you
12	believe graduate students should be left alone; correct?
13	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
14	A. Yes. Yes. I personally, for me, see nothing
15	to be gained from -- I mean, my interest is not in
16	graduate students, it is in the methods, the materials,
Page 88
17	you know, the historical arguments that are put together
18	by defense experts as I've written about in my published
19	research.
20	BY MS. BROWN:
21	Q. Now, you've brought up several times this
22	morning the Barbanell deposition; correct?
23	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
24	A. Well, you were asking me -- it's because you
25	were the person asking or you were at the Barbanell
70
1	deposition. That's correct. You were there.
2	BY MS. BROWN:
3	Q. I was at that deposition. And at that
4	deposition, we've already agreed, we didn't have these
5	e-mails; right?
6	A. That's correct.
7	MR. mcpharlin: Objection to form. Asked and
8	answered.
9	BY MS. BROWN:
10	Q. But there's no question that you had already
11	reviewed the May -- at least the May 23rd e-mail from
12	Dr. Proctor; correct?
13	MR. McPHARLlN: As of the -- that's your
14	question? Did he see the e-mail before the
15	Barbanell deposition? That's your question, right?
16	BY MS. BROWN:
17	Q. As of the Barbanell deposition, there is no
18	dispute that you saw the May -- you had already reviewed
19	the May 23rd e-mail; correct?
20	MR. McPHARLlN: That's been previously asked in
21	every single deposition, I think, on this matter.
22	Maybe not every one, but certainly him, certainly
23	Koballa multiple times, multiple different ways.
24	BY MS. BROWN:
25	Q. And, again, Dr. Kyriakoudes, there's no
71
1	dispute --
2	MR. McPHARLlN: Professor, don't answer that.
3	A. If you're moving on to another question, I just
228388
4	want to top off my water glass.
5	MS. BROWN: Let's take a break.
6	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We're off the video record.
7	(Discussion held off the record.)
8	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video
9	record.
10	MS. BROWN: Let's go ahead and mark this as the
11	next exhibit.
12	(Exhibit No. 10 marked for identification.)
13	BY MS. BROWN:
14	Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, can you identify what
15	Exhibit 10 is?
16	A. This is one of the e-mails that I produced at
17	the Koballa deposition.
18	Q. This is another e-mail. This is one on which
19	you were copied from Dr. Proctor to Professor Smocovitis
20	at the University of Florida; correct?
21	A. That's correct.
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked at prior
23	depositions.
24	BY MS. BROWN:
228388
25	Q. I just want to make sure we had all your
1	e-mails in front of you. Again, these -- none of the
2	e-mails that we've been talking about this morning, your
3	transmittal e-mail or the two e-mails from Dr. Proctor
4	were produced prior to the Koballa deposition on
5	August 24th; correct?
6	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
7	depositions. Professor, don't answer that.
8	BY MS. BROWN:
9	Q. Now, July 9th, you were deposed in the Grossman
10	case; right?
11	A. Yes. I think that's the date.
12	Q. And we talked about the fact that you were
13	asked questions by Mr. Carter for R.J. Reynolds;
14	correct?
15	MR. MCPHARLIN: Asked and answered.
16	A. I was asked questions by an R.J. Reynolds
17	attorney. That's true.
18	BY MS. BROWN:
19	Q. And do you recall that he asked you questions
20	about what you knew, if anything, about Dr. Proctor's
21	contacts with Professor Smocovitis regarding the
22	involvement of University of Florida grad students in
23	research with Dr. Michel?
24	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
25	depositions.
73
1	A. it came up I recall. I don't recall the exact
2	wording of it. But, yes, it came up. Yeah.
3	BY MS. BROWN:
4	Q. You remember that subject matter being
5	addressed?
6	A. Yes. That was addressed.
7	Q. And did you tell Mr. Carter that the questions
8	in Barbanell were the first time you had heard anything
9	about the contact that Dr. Proctor had with anyone at
10	the University of Florida regarding research assistants
11	or grad students?
12	MR. MCPHARLIN: Are you referring to a specific
13	portion of the deposition? Because I think it's
14	unfair to ask him about a deposition without
15	directing him to the deposition and giving him an
16	opportunity to review it. So if you have the
17	deposition and then a specific reference in the
18	deposition, you should have him look at it instead
19	of asking him from memory back months ago. So can
20	we get the deposition.
21	MS. BROWN: Well, at this point I am asking
22	Dr. Kyriakoudes if he recalls, Todd, if he has a
23	problem recalling. We can go from there, but --
24	MR. MCPHARLIN: I think we should give him the
25	deposition.
74
1	MS. BROWN: Please read back my question, Nora.
2	I'd appreciate it.
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: So we don't talk over each
4	other, I think he should have the deposition in
5	front of him so that he can refer to it if he needs
228388
6	to. So if you're going to ask him about it,
7	let's -- we should get the deposition out.
8	MS. BROWN: Nora, would you mind reading back
9	my question.
10	(The question was read by the reporter.)
11	A. I'd like to read --
12	MR. KEANE: Are you going to show him the
13	deposition?
14	MS. BROWN: if he needs to see it, Mr. Keane.
15	I am still waiting for Dr. Kyriakoudes' answer.
16	MR. KEANE: You know how to use depositions.
17	If you're going to refer someone to something they
18	said in a deposition and you want to ask about
19	specific questions and answers that were given, show
20	him the deposition.
21	BY MS. BROWN:
22	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, do you recall telling
23	Mr. Carter that the questions in Barbanell were the
24	first you had heard about anything related to contact
25	between Dr. Proctor and any professor at the University
1	of Florida?
2	MR. McPHARLlN: Just so the record is clear,
3	Counsel has been requested to provide Professor
4	Kyriakoudes with the deposition and she is refusing
5	to do so.
6	MS. BROWN: I'm not refusing to do so. I am
7	asking for an answer to my question. If
8	Dr. Kyriakoudes needs to see the transcript, then at
9	that point we can pull the transcript. But I'm
10	entitled to ask him if he recalls. And that's what
11	I am asking him.
12	MR. KEANE: As his counsel, in this serious
13	proceeding, in which time has been reserved for you
14	to explore the subject matter of serious motions, if
15	you're going to ask him about depositions, I'm going
16	to ask you respectfully provide him with the
17	deposition and be fair about it. That's what I am
18	going to ask you to do.
19	MS. BROWN: And your request has been made,
20	Mr. Keane.
21	MR. KEANE: And I understand it's being denied;
22	is that right?
23	MS. BROWN: Until my question is answered,
24	which is: Do you recall that testimony?
25	MR. KEANE: You're asking him to recall
76
1	portions of a deposition taken months ago that he
2	does not have in front of him and that's
3	fundamentally unfair. And I'm renewing my request
4	that you provide him with the deposition and the
5	page and line number, and if you want to ask him
6	about that, you can ask him about that.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I will provide you a copy of
9	the transcript.
10	MR. KEANE: Then let's just do it.
11	BY MS. BROWN:
12	Q. But I'm asking you whether you recall giving
13	that testimony.
14	MR. MCPHARLIN: Professor, I think you need to
15	listen to your counsel. So, Professor, hold on. I
16	think you need to listen to your attorney so --
17	BY MS. BROWN:
18	Q. Mr. McPharlin's pointing out to you Mr. Keane
19	has made a speaking objection and he would like you to
20	follow that direction.
21	MR. MCPHARLIN: You just said that you would
22	provide him with the deposition.
23	MS. BROWN: As soon as my question is answered,
24	Mr. Keane.
25	MR. KEANE: Just do it. You know, I don't want
77
1	to become a player in this. I'm trying to guide
2	this gentleman through a difficult situation. But
3	this is taking on an abusive nature and there's not
4	much I can do about it except move to terminate the
5	deposition. So if you're planning on giving him the
6	deposition, give him the deposition. That's fair.
7	That's honest. Give him the deposition.
228388
8	MR. henk: Take a break.
9	MS. BROWN: Well, there is a question pending,
10	now. And I've made it clear, as soon as the
11	question is answered --
12	MR. HENK: I think he is getting ready to
13	terminate the deposition unless you provide the
14	transcript.
15	MR. McPHARLlN: Listen, you're not a party to
16	this deposition.
17	MR. KEANE: I will take the action that I
18	believe is appropriate. But you're very correct.
19	I'm very concerned about the manner in which this
20	deposition is being conducted. And when you start
21	asking about prior deposition testimony and you
22	don't show him the deposition, I believe what you're
23	trying to do is trip him up on some faulty
24	recollection of what was said and you need to show
25	him the deposition. That's only fair. You wouldn't
1	be allowed to do it in a courtroom. You wouldn't be
Page 99
2	allowed to do it in impeachment. You wouldn't be
3	allowed to ask questions about a deposition, a prior
4	deposition in any context in a court proceeding
5	without giving him the deposition. And the rule on
6	taking depositions is that examination shall be
7	conducted as that trial. And so I'm asking you
8	respectfully, once again, to please give him the
9	deposition.
10	MS. BROWN: To move this along, I am going to
11	provide the deposition. But I do not believe
12	there's any rule that says you cannot ask a witness
13	if they recall testimony. If Dr. Kyriakoudes needs
14	to see it, he can always ask to take a look at it.
15	MR. KEANE: Do you have a copy? Thank you.
16	BY MS. BROWN:
17	Q. Okay. Dr. Kyriakoudes, if you would please
18	turn to page 148 -- well, first, just look at the cover
19	Dr. Kyriakoudes. Is this the transcript from your
20	Grossman deposition taken on July 9th in New Orleans?
21	A. Yes.
22	Q. Okay. If you would turn with me to page 148.
Page 100
23	MR. mcpharlin: You had a page and line ready
24	to ask him and you refused to give him the
25	deposition?
79
1	BY MS. BROWN:
2	Q. If you would turn to page 148, Dr. Kyriakoudes,
3	lines 10 to 15. Question: But those hypotheticals --
4	and by those hypotheticals, you understand he's
5	referring to Barbanell?
6	A. That's correct.
7	Q. Okay. But those hypotheticals, that was the
8	first you heard in any of the contacts that he may have
9	had -- and you understand he there is Dr. Proctor;
10	correct?
11	A. Yes. That's correct.
12	Q. Okay. But those hypotheticals asked at the
13	Barbanell deposition, that was the first you heard of
14	any of the contacts that he, that Dr. Proctor, may have
15	had with the University of Florida regarding research
16	assistants? And your answer was: That's right. And I
17	made my position clear on that. Did I read that
18	correctly?
19	A. Yes, you did.
20	Q. That was your answer to that question on
21	July 9th at the Grossman deposition; correct?
22	A. That's correct.
23	Q. But that wasn't accurate testimony, was it,
24	Dr. Kyriakoudes?
25	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form.
80
1	A. Well, when I gave it, it was accurate. I --
2	I've explained this many times. These were not e-mails
3	that I read -- in one case, read at all, or reviewed
4	and/or recollected. This is not anything that I pursued
5	or interested in or, you know, engaged myself in.
6	BY MS. BROWN:
7	Q. Well, earlier you agree, that there is no
8	question that you had reviewed the May 23rd e-mail
9	before your Barbanell deposition. So I assume we can
228388
10	agree that that would be before your Grossman
11	deposition; correct?
12	MR. MCPHARLIN: Professor, don't answer that
13	question. That's been previously asked in multiple
14	depositions, including this one.
15	BY MS. BROWN:
16	Q. So, Dr. Kyriakoudes, it is your position that
17	the answer you gave on page 148 of your Grossman
18	deposition to that question, that that was accurate
19	testimony?
20	MR. McPharlin: Objection. Hold on a second.
21	That has -- you have asked him whether he gave
22	accurate testimony in these cases about those
23	e-mails multiple times, multiple times: Hibner,
24	Koballa, hundreds of pages. So I'm going to
25	instruct him not to answer because you are doing
81
1	exactly what you said you wouldn't do.
2	MS. BROWN: So, Mr. McPharlin, it is your
3	position when we go in front of Judge Streitfeld,
Page 103
4	you will be able to point out to him, page and line
5	in a transcript where Dr. Kyriakoudes was asked
6	whether his answer to that question on page 148 of
7	his Grossman deposition was accurate testimony? Is
8	that your position?
9	MR. MCPHARLIN: Are you saying -- are you
10	representing that he's never been asked if -- let's
11	go to the question again. Can you pull it up.
12	MR. KEANE: 148.
13	MS. BROWN: Let's take a break while you look
14	through the transcript.
15	MR. mcpharlin: what was the page again?
16	MS. BROWN: 148. We're off the record.
17	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the video record.
18	(Discussion off the record.)
19	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video
20	record.
21	BY MS. BROWN:
22	Q. I believe there was a question pending when we
23	took a break.
24	MS. BROWN: Nora, could you read back my
Page 104
25	question.
1	(The question was read by the reporter.)
2	A. At the time that I gave that, yes. it was
3	accurate.
4	BY MS. BROWN:
5	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you say that is accurate,
6	while not disputing; correct, that you had received and
7	reviewed an e-mail from Dr. Proctor on May 23rd that
8	laid out his contact with Professor Smocovitis and
9	disclosed the names of Dr. Michelle's research
10	assistants at the university of Florida; correct?
11	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Argumentative.
12	A. Yes. And I just want to point out that when
13	you say reviewed, to clarify, as I've testified many
14	times, that I took the briefest glance at the e-mail and
15	skipped over it and did not read the entire thing and
16	did not recollect that e-mail.
17	BY MS. BROWN:
18	Q. But, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you do admit that you
19	read at least the beginning of the e-mail that refers to
20	Professor Smocovitis; correct?
21	MR. McPharlin: Objection. Asked and answered.
22	A. I skimmed through the very, you know, initial
23	part of the e-mail and didn't think it was anything that
24	required any action on my part, did not read the whole
25	thing and skipped over it. And that's -- I've said that
83
1	many times. You've asked me about that a number of
2	times here and at previous depositions. And at the
3	Barbanell trial, I did not -- I did not recall that.
4	BY MS. BROWN:
5	Q. Didn't Mr. Carter's question concerning
6	Dr. Proctor's contact with Professor Smocovitis
7	regarding these graduate students trigger any memory for
8	you?
9	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
10	MR. KEANE: Object to the form.
11	A. Are you talking about the -- no. No. They
12	didn't.
13	BY MS. BROWN:
14	Q. Hearing Professor Smocovitis' name and in
15	reference to Dr. Michelle's research assistants didn't
16	ring a bell at all for you?
17	A. Well, her name was known to me because it had
18	come up in the Barbanell deposition. That's when her
19	name was introduced to me.
20	Q. And at the Barbanell deposition when you were
21	questioned at length about whether you had any knowledge
22	of Professor Proctor's contact with Professor
23	Smocovitis, none of these questions rung any bells for
24	you, as far as the fact you had received and reviewed an
25	e-mail from Dr. Proctor reporting on his contact with
84
1	Professor Smocovitis?
2	A. No. I had never heard of her.
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form. Previously
4	asked in prior depositions.
5	BY MS. BROWN:
6	Q. You've never heard of her besides that e-mail
7	from May 23rd; correct?
8	A. Well, my recollection of the Barbanell
9	testimony was -- when I testified in Barbanell, I had
10	never heard of her until that point. I did not recall
11	that prior e-mail which I, you know, did not completely
12	review. I've testified on this quite a bit.
13	Q. Now, you know Dr. Proctor was retained as an
14	expert in the Barbanell case; correct?
15	A. Well, I -- I don't know that. I didn't know
16	that, or if I did, you know -- I don't keep up on, you
17	know, who the other experts are.
18	Q. Prior to the e-mail that you received from
19	Dr. Proctor that you did not produce today that set out
20	a list of trials that you have -- the two of you have
21	upcoming in the Engle litigation, have you exchanged
22	e-mails like that at any time before?
23	A. Okay. Now, run that by me again. Are you
24	referring to the e-mail that I referred to when you were
25	going over the schedule A?
1	Q. Yes.
2	A. Okay. So that was a -- you know, that was an
3	e-mail. And so then your question is?
4	Q. That was an e-mail from the winter; correct?
5	A. Yes. Yes.
6	Q. And you set out a list of cases that you had
7	coming up -8	A. Yeah.
9	Q. -- or that Dr. Proctor had coming up.
10	A. Or discussed -- discussed cases. Yeah.
11	Q. was either Barbanell or Grossman discussed in
12	that e-mail?
13	A. No. No. To be precise, it had discussed a
14	case that had already happened in that e-mail.
15	Q. what case was that?
16	A. You're asking me the name, the names run
17	together. But it was the one in Broward County where
18	Gary Paige was the plaintiff's attorney. And that -- it
19	might be Sherman, it might be Hess, it was that first
20	one after the -- after the new year. I'm forgetting the
21	exact name of the case. But I think I've given you
22	enough information that you can identify the case tried
23	in Broward County, you know, after the new year where
24	Gary Paige was the lead attorney.
25	Q. And what was the nature of your discussion in
86
1	that e-mail with Dr. Proctor?
2	A. Just about -- just stuff about the testimony.
3	Q. Was this the case where Dr. Proctor's testimony
4	resulted in mistrial?
5	A. Yes. it was that case.
6	Q. The Hess case?
7	A. That -- thank you. I was not remembering the
8	exact name of it.
9	Q. And did the e-mail discuss the mistrial?
10	A. No.
11	Q. Did it discuss Dr. Proctor's testimony that
12	resulted in the mistrial?
13	A. No.
228388
14	Q. Now, after your Barbanell deposition, you
15	talked to Dr. Proctor and told him about the questions
16	you had been asked at the Barbanell deposition; right?
17	A. I don't think so. No. I don't think I did
18	that.
19	Q. So when you think back to your Barbanell
20	testimony, can you recall a conversation you had with
21	Dr. Proctor at any point about the types of questions
22	you were being asked at the Barbanell deposition related
23	to the University of Florida grad students?
24	MR. KEANE: Object to the form of the question.
25	A. No. I did not talk to him about that issue.
87
1	BY MS. BROWN
2	Q. You didn't give Dr. Proctor a heads-up that
3	defense counsel were asking questions about his contact
4	with Professor Smocovitis at the University of Florida?
5	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Asked and answered.
6	A. No, I didn't. I did not do that.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. Well, you've looked at your Koballa deposition
9	fairly recently; correct?
10	A. Yes. in a deposition. Yes.
11	Q. In fact, you were reading it during -- or had
12	it in front of you during your deposition on
13	October 1st; correct, in the Hibner case?
14	A. That's correct. Yeah. Refresh my memory.
15	Q. I'm handing you, Dr. Kyriakoudes, the Koballa
16	deposition. Doctor, if you could turn with me to page
17	228, line nine.
18	A. Let me get there. Just give me a second to get
19	where you are.
20	Q. Are you there, Doctor, 228, line nine?
21	A. Uh-hum.
22	Q. Okay. You were asked: Have you ever spoken
23	with Dr. Proctor about this situation that led to the
24	subpoenaing of the documents? And you answered: After
25	I was asked in that, you know, it came up in a
1	deposition called Barbanell, which I'm sure you're aware
2	of. And I asked him about it just in general way. I
3	told him that I was asked about this. That's all. I
4	just left him -- I informed him. I've tried, you know,
5	because of this, you know, we are not really spoken a
6	lot -- we've not really spoken a lot, only in a kind of
7	necessity basis to handle the logistics of the history
8	of science conference. So I've kind of kept my
9	distance.
10	Was that the question that was asked of you and
11	the answer you gave at your Koballa deposition on
12	August 24, 2009?
13	MR. MCPHARLIN: Take your time to read it.
14	A. And repeat your question 'cause I was reading
15	while you asked that.
16	BY MS. BROWN:
17	Q. Did I read that correctly? was that the
18	question that you were asked and the answer you gave at
19	the Koballa deposition on August 24, 2009?
20	A. That's correct. And -- and this is all
21	accurate. I did not give him a heads-up after the
22	Barbanell trial which is -- or deposition, which is what
23	you asked me about.
24	Q. But I also asked you if you had a conversation
25	with Dr. Proctor. You, in fact, did have a conversation
89
1	with Dr. Proctor about the questions you were asked
2	related to this issue with the Barbanell deposition;
3	correct?
4	A. Yes. But this was much later.
5	Q. When did this conversation with Dr. Proctor
6	take place?
7	A. Significantly after the Barbanell deposition.
8	Q. when did the conversation take place,
9	Dr. Kyriakoudes?
10	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Asked and answered.
11	A. I'm not exactly recalling the exact date. But
12	it was not right after the Barbanell deposition.
13	BY MS. BROWN:
14	Q. was it two weeks later?
15	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Asked and answered.
16	A. No more than that I would think. I would -- I
17	would -- this is -- this is much later. Probably in
18	July.
19	BY MS. BROWN:
20	Q. In July you had this conversation with
21	Dr. Proctor?
22	A. Well, I'm not recalling exactly when I had it,
23	but I didn't have it at any time close to the Barbanell
24	deposition. I can say that with certainty.
25	Q. Did you have this conversation with Dr. Proctor
90
1	prior to July 9th?
2	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
3	A. No. Must have been after that.
4	BY MS. BROWN:
5	Q. Why must it have been after that?
6	A. Well, it was -- it was after the Barbanell
7	deposition, significantly later than the Barbanell
8	deposition, it may well have been after that, but I
9	don't recall the exact date.
Page 115
10	Q. So it could have been before July 9th?
11	MR. mcpharlin: Objection. Asked and answered.
12	Speculation.
13	A. I couldn't say either way.
14	BY MS. BROWN:
15	Q. And tell me what exactly you discussed with
16	Dr. Proctor during that phone conversation.
17	MR. MCPHARLIN: Asked and answered in the
18	previous deposition obviously. Correct, Counsel?
19	A. I just told him that I was asked about this
20	general issue and did not go into detail because it was
21	just -- just as a general, you know, that I had been
22	asked about this. That's all.
23	BY MS. BROWN:
24	Q. Did this conversation take place before or
25	after you searched for e-mails and found three related
91
1	to this issue on your computer?
2	MR. mcpharlin: Objection to form. Asked and
228388
3	answered multiple times.
4	A. I can't recall exactly, precisely when they may
5	have all been. So I just can't recall. I mean, months
6	ago. So I don't know.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. who initiated that phone call?
9	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Asked and answered
10	in the prior deposition.
11	A. I'm not sure.
12	BY MS. BROWN:
13	Q. Did you disclose to counsel that you had this
14	call with Dr. Proctor at your Grossman deposition?
15	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form.
16	A. I don't think I had this prior to the Grossman
17	deposition, if I had it, I probably would have
18	disclosed it. I was probably asked and I don't recall
19	what I testified in Grossman. But my recollection of
20	these phone calls in Grossman would have been accurate.
21	BY MS. BROWN:
22	Q. So whatever you said in Grossman you think is
23	accurate?
228388
24	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
25	A. Yes. At the time that I gave it. Yes.
92
1	BY MS. BROWN:
2	Q. Did you disclose these conversations to defense
3	counsel in your Evers deposition?
4	A. I'd -- I'd have to re-read that testimony. I
5	don't recal1.
6	Q. How about in your Willis deposition?
7	A. Well, those basically happened at the same
8	time. So same answer. They were essentially coincident
9	depositions. I was asked questions the same day about
10	each of those.
11	Q. You had this conversation with Dr. Proctor --
12	A. I'm sorry, I was -- let me finish. I was asked
13	questions about those two cases on the same day. So I
14	don't have a distinct recollection of one versus the
15	other.
16	Q. In your conversation with Dr. Proctor, you told
17	him that you were asked questions related to his contact
18	with Professor Smocovitis at the Barbanell deposition;
19	is that correct?
20	A. I'm sorry, say that again?
21	Q. You told Dr. Proctor in that conversation that
22	you had been asked questions about his contact with
23	Professor Smocovitis during your Barbanell deposition;
24	is that right?
25	MR. MCPHARLIN: Ms. Brown, these question
93
1	questions have been asked. You asked -- you asked
2	him to read a deposition where he was asked about
3	that conversation. So can we agree that that
4	question has already been asked, Ms. Brown?
5	A. Yeah. My answer --
6	MR. MCPHARLIN: Louis -- Mr. -- Professor
7	Kyriakoudes. Can we agree that you're asking him
8	something that has already been asked very clearly?
9	You won't even make that recognition?
10	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, I'm asking the
11	questions here.
12	MR. McPHARLlN: I understand that. But you're
13	not abiding with what you told the judge. You're
14	asking him about a conversation that has been --
15	he's been questioned about and you're actually -- we
16	know that because you're pointing him to a
17	deposition where he was asked about it.
18	BY MS. BROWN:
19	Q. In addition to -- or during your conversation
20	with Dr. Proctor, you did tell him about the questions
21	that you had been asked related to his contact with
22	Professor Smocovitis at the Barbanell deposition;
23	correct?
24	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
25	depositions. Are you going to refer him to some
94
1	portion of the deposition?
2	MS. BROWN: You know, what is dragging this out
3	is, these are perfunctory questions.
4	MR. MCPHARLIN: They're not.
228388
5	MS. BROWN: Yes or no, you did talk to
6	Dr. Proctor in that conversation about the fact that
7	you had been asked questions in your Barbanell
8	deposition related to his contact with Professor
9	Smocovitis; correct?
10	MR. McPharlin: That has been previously asked
11	and answered and has been previously discussed in
12	prior depositions.
13	MS. BROWN: Right. We just read it --
14	MR. MCPHARLIN: Hold on. Please don't
15	interrupt me. Please don't interrupt me. There is
16	nothing perfunctory about any of the questions
17	you're asking him. Trust me. I understand that.
18	Professor Kyriakoudes understands that. Mr. Keane
19	understands that. You're not asking a perfunctory
20	question. Every question has some intent behind it.
21	So there is nothing ministerial about what you're
22	doing.
23	MS. BROWN: Mr. McPharlin, is it your intent to
24	eat up as much time as you can with these
25	long-speaking objections? Is that your intent?
1	MR. MCPHARLIN: You're asking him questions
2	that have obviously been asked in prior depositions
3	despite what the judge instructed you to do.
4	BY MS. BROWN:
5	Q. In addition to discussing with Dr. Proctor the
6	fact that you had been asked questions about his contact
7	with Professor Smocovitis during your Barbanell
8	deposition, did you talk to him about similar
9	questioning at any other depositions?
10	A. No.
11	MR. KEANE: Object to the form of that
12	question.
13	BY MS. BROWN:
14	Q. Why not?
15	A. We didn't talk about it that much.
16	Q. And why did you raise with him on the telephone
17	the fact that you had been questioned on that issue at
18	your Barbanell deposition?
19	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
20	A. You know, I was asked about things that, at
21	that time, I didn't have a knowledge of related to his
22	behavior. So I just -- it came up in a conversation and
23	I just made mention of it. But I recall it was not
24	after the Barbanell testimony and that it was -- it was
25	sometime after that. And I didn't go into detail.
96
1	BY MS. BROWN:
2	Q. Did you ask him any questions about what
3	exactly he was doing through his contact with Professor
4	Smocovitis?
5	A. I didn't. No. I didn't -- I didn't ask him
6	those questions.
7	Q. Did you ask him why he was in contact with
8	Professor Smocovitis?
9	A. No, I didn't. I didn't.
10	Q. Did you discuss with him the e-mail that he had
11	sent you on May 23rd?
12	A. No.
13	Q. Why not?
14	A. Because we didn't have a deep conversation
15	about this. I just made him aware that I had been asked
16	questions, that his name had come up in a deposition
17	that had not really -- from my recollection -- happened
18	before. So in that conversation, that's all I did.
19	MR. MCPHARLIN: Hang on one second. Hang on
20	one second, what time did we go on the record?
21	Nora, what time did we go on the record?
22	COURT REPORTER: About five after 11:00.
23	MR. MCPHARLIN: Okay.
24	BY MS. BROWN:
25	Q. Now, subsequent to this conversation you had a
97
1	conversation with Dr. Proctor on August 21st; correct?
2	A. Yeah. That's correct.
3	Q. Okay. During that conversation --
4	MR. MCPHARLIN: Hold on. Hold on. That
5	question has been previously asked in prior
6	depositions.
228388
7	MS. BROWN: How do I get one place to the
8	other, Todd, without bringing up the date?
9	MR. MCPHARLIN: I am just making a record. I'm
10	not instructing him.
11	MS. BROWN: Okay.
12	BY MS. BROWN:
13	Q. On August 21st, you discussed with Dr. Proctor
14	the fact that his e-mails had been subpoenaed in a case
15	in Volusia County; correct?
16	MR. MCPHARLIN: Hold on, Professor. Don't
17	answer that question. That has been asked and
18	answered. Are you representing that that question
19	has never been asked and answered?
20	MS. BROWN: I am representing that I need to
21	ask that question to lay context for my following
22	questions, Todd. I need you to quit interfering
23	with the deposition.
24	MR. MCPHARLIN: I'm not. why don't you just
25	ask your question. You don't need your foundation.
1	You don't need your -- your perfunctory questions,
2	as you call them. Just ask your question.
3	BY MS. BROWN:
4	Q. That was my question, Dr. Kyriakoudes. On
5	August 21st, you discussed with Dr. Proctor the fact
6	that some of his -- or that his e-mails had been
7	subpoenaed in a case in Volusia County; correct?
8	A. That's correct.
9	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked.
10	BY MS. BROWN:
11	Q. And that was the first time that you had heard
12	that documents had -- were being subpoenaed; correct?
13	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
14	depositions multiple times.
15	BY MS. BROWN:
16	Q. Correct?
17	A. Okay. I'm just waiting for the air to clear.
18	That's correct.
19	Q. Do you recall in the Koballa case -- in the
20	Koballa deposition, rather, on August 24th testifying
21	that you did not talk to Dr. Proctor on August 21st
22	about anything related to any of the smoking and health
23	lawsuits?
24	MR. MCPHARLIN: Okay. Hold on. Let's direct
25	him to the deposition. If you're going to ask him
99
1	about his testimony, you need to tell him what
2	you're referring to. He should have an opportunity
3	to look at it.
4	MS. BROWN: And I will direct him to that as
5	soon as he answers the question of whether he
6	recalls.
7	MR. MCPHARLIN: Hold on. Hold on. That is a
8	fundamentally unfair way to take a deposition and
9	you know it. So if you're asking him about what he
10	testified in the deposition, show him the
11	deposition.
12	MS. BROWN: We're going to treat that, because
13	we've got to get this moving, we are going to treat
14	that as an instruction not to answer that question.
15	And I will move to my next question to expedite
Page 127
16	things.
17	MR. MCPHARLIN: You can do what you want.
18	BY MS. BROWN:
19	Q. Okay. Doctor, if you would turn with me in
20	your Koballa deposition --
21	A. Is it more or less than 167?
22	Q. Less. 163. If you could turn with me to 163.
23	MR. MCPHARLIN: You hit your two hours.
24	MS. BROWN: But we did take some breaks in
25	there, Todd.
100
1	MR. MCPHARLIN: You hit your two hours. We
2	haven't taken any breaks of any substance.
3	MR. KEANE: You're counting breaks in the two
4	hours?
5	MS. BROWN: There is a question pending anyway,
6	Todd.
7	MR. MCPHARLIN: I'm just letting you know you
8	hit your two hours, though.
9	BY MS. BROWN:
10	Q. Dr. Proctor, if you'd look at page 163.
11	A. Uh-hum.
12	Q. Okay. If you start at line 13: Have you
13	spoken with him recently? And you understand him to be
14	Dr. Proctor; correct?
15	A. Yes.
16	Q. Your answer was: Yes. I talked with Robert.
17	Question: Okay. When did you last talk to him?
18	Answer: I talked with him this weekend on the phone.
19	Question: What did you-all discuss? Answer: We are --
20	I am on a panel with the history of science society. We
21	talk about that. It's coming up in November. Question:
22	Okay. Did you talk about anything related to any of
23	these smoking and health lawsuits? No. No. I didn't
24	talk to him about that. Did I read that correctly,
25	Doctor?
101
1	A. Yes.
2	Q. And then if we jump, Doctor, to page 165, line
3	11. Question: Okay. Have you spoken with Dr. Proctor
4	at all about his contacts with this professor at the
5	University of Florida? Answer: No, I haven't. Did I
6	read those correctly?
7	A. Yes.
8	Q. That answer was incorrect, inaccurate when you
9	gave it on August 24, 2009 in your Koballa deposition,
10	wasn't it?
11	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
12	A. No. I mean, this is -- when I gave the answer,
13	I was answering truthfully to the best of my abilities.
14	I know you -- these are all conversations that happened
15	much later for which, you know, I don't keep notes on my
16	phone calls, for which I, you know -- when you asked me
17	the question, I give you the best answer that I can on
18	my knowledge at that time.
19	BY MS. BROWN:
20	Q. Doctor, you're -- the conversation with
21	Dr. Proctor that's being discussed here, this was a
22	conversation that you had with Dr. Proctor on
23	August 21st; correct?
24	A. Yes.
25	Q. And your deposition, this deposition in Koballa
102
1	was taken on August 24th; correct?
2	A. Yes.
3	Q. That would be three days later; correct?
4	A. That's correct.
5	Q. So when you testified that in your August 21st
6	deposition that you did not talk about anything related
7	to any of these smoking and health lawsuits and you
8	said: No. No. I didn't talk to him about that, that
9	was inaccurate, wasn't it?
10	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
11	A. You know, at the time that -- again, you know,
12	I can't -- I don't keep all of this straight. I gave
13	you the best answer I can at the time, when I gave the
14	answer, I believe that I was answering accurately and
15	truthfully.
16	BY MS. BROWN:
17	Q. So your testimony three days after the
Page 131
18	conversation is worse than your memory a month after the
19	conversation?
20	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form.
21	A. No. What I'm saying is, you know, you've
22	asked -- asked me questions about this at great length
23	at many different times. And, you know, sometimes
24	I get -- you know, sometimes I get some of the details
25	incorrectly, or when I give -- when I give the testimony
103
1	at that time, I'm doing my best to recall as accurately
2	as possible. But, you know, I can't keep all of this --
3	I mean, it doesn't all, you know, come right to mind at
4	once. There's a lot going on in -- in my day. And this
5	is only a small part of it. And so, you know, I do my
6	best to answer truthfully when you ask me the questions.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. Given the fact that you now admit that you
9	talked to Dr. Proctor about the documents being
10	subpoenaed in this smoking and health litigation and his
11	contact with Professor Smocovitis, there's no question
12	that this testimony is inaccurate; correct --
13	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
14	BY MS. BROWN:
15	Q. -- at the Koballa deposition?
16	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
17	Mischaracterization. Asked and answered.
18	A. Well, you know, you've asked me about this and
19	I'm going to give the same answer, which is, you know,
20	when I gave this testimony, I was giving the most
21	accurate testimony I could give. You know, I've been
22	deposed on average about once every other week on these
23	issues since the summer. And to be honest with you, you
24	know, I can't completely recall all the specific details
25	of all the specific points that you've asked me about
104
1	that relate to conversations and other things. So, you
2	know, my testimony is what it is. And, you know, I am
3	not possessed of a perfect recollection of all of the
4	phone calls. I mean, when I gave this testimony, I was
228388
5	doing my best to give accurate testimony.
6	BY MS. BROWN:
7	Q. But, Dr. Kyriakoudes, my question is, this
8	answer to this question, whether on August 21st you
9	talked to Dr. Proctor about any of these issues and you
10	answered: No, no, I didn't talk to him about that, that
11	was inaccurate?
12	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
13	Mischaracterization. Asked and answered.
14	A. Well, to be honest with you, I can't really say
15	because what I've got is conflicting testimony and I'm
16	not recalling, you know, specific dates. I'd have to
17	review all of this and take it into consideration. I
18	agree, it conflicts a bit, but, you know, I'm possessed
19	of imperfect memory.
20	BY MS. BROWN:
21	Q. Do you remember in your Koballa deposition
22	saying that you don't need a good memory if you are
23	telling the truth?
24	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
25	A. Yes.
1	MR. McPHARLlN: Argumentative.
2	A. That's true.
3	MR. McPHARLlN: Asked and answered.
4	A. I'm not --
5	BY MS. BROWN:
6	Q. And on August 24th when you said you had not
7	talked to Dr. Proctor on August 21st about any of these
8	smoking and health suits, and that you had not spoken
9	with him about his contacts with the Professor at the
10	University of Florida, and you said you hadn't, both of
11	those things were untrue, weren't they?
12	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form.
13	Mischaracterization. Asked and answered multiple
14	times. Argumentative.
15	A. Well, I'm not sure which one is the most
16	accurate, to be honest with you. So I can't say.
17	MR. McPHARLlN: All right. We've hit our two
18	hours.
19	BY MS. BROWN:
20	Q. So --
21	MR. MCPHARLIN: Hold on. Hold on. No. We've
22	gone over it's now 2:15 -- 1:15; right? We're over
23	the two hours. Ten minutes over the two hours. So
24	that's it. We're done with this line of
25	questioning.
106
1	BY MS. BROWN:
2	Q. So, Dr. Kyriakoudes --
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: No. Ms. Brown, we're done,
4	just so you know.
5	MS. BROWN: You know, if we take out all of
6	your speaking objections, Todd, you probably got
7	another hour.
8	MR. McPharlin: Like I said, we are done with
9	this line of questioning. I'm following the court's
10	instructions. Okay. I would ask you to do the
11	same.
12	MS. BROWN: Okay. Mr. Keane, Dr. Kyriakoudes,
13	Mr. McPharlin, I just want to make sure everybody
14	around the table understands that given the way this
15	deposition has gone this morning, the numerous
16	long-speaking objections that were made and the
17	numerous instructions not to answer questions, we
18	are going to have to seek relief from the court and
19	the likelihood is that we're going to be back here
20	for another deposition.
21	Now, the way I see it, we have other options,
22	which is we can complete questioning on these
23	issues. Mr. McPharlin, as you well know, we have a
24	trial coming up, or we can risk delay of that trial
25	while we sort these issues out in front of the court
107
1	and have to schedule yet another deposition of
2	Dr. Kyriakoudes on these issues.
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: I am abiding with what the
4	court instructed us. You had two hours to ask him
5	questions, the questions that you had not asked
6	previously. You have not abided with that. I have
7	given you until ten minutes over the two-hour mark.
8	I've given you more leeway than I should given what
9	you've put Professor Kyriakoudes through. And
10	that's it. So, you know, you could have asked more
11	questions if you had chose to ask questions that
12	hadn't previously been asked. But you chose to ask
13	multiple questions that I let go, as well as the
14	ones that I objected to. And that was your choice.
15	So we're done with this line of questioning as
16	instructed by the judge. Okay, why don't we take a
17	break.
18	MR. KEANE: Just so the record is clear, how
19	much more time do you think you need?
20	MS. BROWN: You know, we could probably wrap
21	this up in another half hour, assuming every
22	question isn't instructed not to be answered or
23	there aren't 15 minutes of objections made during
24	the questioning.
25	MR. KEANE: Again, my view of this is from up
1	high. I'm not in the trees. I've watched you time
2	and time again ask questions that are right in the
3	depositions, we had a skirmish about whether you'd
4	give him a deposition to read when you wanted to ask
5	him about a line and page number. You are sitting
6	there with highlighted depositions that you have to
7	look at that you didn't want to share with him.
8	That ate some time. But the breaks were miniscule
9	and nothing changed.
10	After things were called to your attention, you
11	continued to ask questions that have already been
12	asked. I've read the transcript. You did make that
13	promise. And for you to -- for you to blame
14	Mr. McPharlin for holding your feet to the fire, it
15	just seems unfair to me that, you know, we had a
16	page and line number of the exact question that you
17	continued to insist on asking again. That's how you
18	chose to use your time.
19	MS. BROWN: Mr. Keane, and, again, I understand
20	that you're up high and so you're not as familiar
21	with the issues --
Page 139
22	MR. KEANE: And I only mean that in the sense
23	of the example versus being in the trees.
24	MS. BROWN: I understand. Please understand.
25	I was not trying to mischaracterize your analogy.
109
1	MR. KEANE: The Hubble be exalted and I'm --
2	MS. BROWN: That was not my intent at all. I
3	understand that you're not intimately involved in
4	these issues, that you've been brought in by
5	Dr. Kyriakoudes to defend him or represent him in
6	this deposition. I understand that.
7	Part of the problem we have here is that one of
8	the issues is the depositions contain different
9	answers. And there's really no way to get at that
10	without going back over some of the questions that
11	are being asked to determine what is the answer.
12	One day -- now Mr. Keane, one day I had a
13	conversation with Dr. Proctor in which we didn't
14	discuss that. A month later I had a conversation
228388
15	with Dr. Proctor where we did discuss that.
16	MR. KEANE: The -- the essence of what you are
17	saying about doctor -- to the court, as I understand
18	it, is that this is part of some conspiracy to
19	frustrate your ability to hire people to work for
20	the -- for the defense team. And you haven't
21	touched a single fact that suggests that. You
22	haven't asked a question about what his activities
23	were.
24	I fully expected, having read the lead up to
25	this, that this deposition would be about: what did
110
1	you do? Not about trying to reconcile depositions
2	that are already of record, already on paper,
3	already sworn to. And you haven't asked a single
4	question about what did he do to block somebody's
5	efforts.
6	In fact, he told you numerous times that he was
7	in favor of research aids finding a way to eat some
8	meat once a week, I think was his -- was his
9	testimony. And for whatever reason you elected not
10	to go near that and that speaks volumes. So I've
11	been invited to go discuss this with counsel for a
12	minute and let us do that 'cause I don't want to
13	make my client have to go through this again. So
14	let's see if we can figure something out.
15	MS. BROWN: Okay.
16	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Off the video record.
17	(Discussion off the record.)
18	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video
19	record.
20	BY MS. BROWN:
21	Q. Now, Dr. Kyriakoudes, on August 22, 2009, which
22	was two days before your Koballa deposition, you had a
23	phone call with a plaintiff's counsel in the Engle
24	Progeny cases; correct?
25	A. That's correct.
Ill
1	THE VIDEOGRAPHER: Ms. Brown, your mic.
2	MR. KEANE: Before -- before you ask another
Page 142
3	question, that didn't get on the record, I would
4	like it on the record that we have had a discussion.
5	Counsel has represented that she needs an additional
6	30 minutes to conclude. After much angst, we are
7	agreeable to allowing her that so that we can finish
8	this because of the great expense and distance and
9	all that is involved and for no other reason. So go
10	ahead.
11	MS. BROWN: Now, one thing I want to make sure
12	is clear on the record as well though, is that is
13	without prejudice to our raising with the court the
14	number of times Dr. Kyriakoudes was instructed not
15	to answer a question.
16	MR. KEANE: And I'm quite sure to our side to
17	point out to the court that notwithstanding your
18	promise not to ask the same questions again, you
19	did, over and over and over. So let's go.
20	BY MS. BROWN:
21	Q. During your conversation with Mr. Shultz -- I'm
22	sorry, first of all, the plaintiff's lawyer with whom
23	you had a conversation on August 22nd was Matt Schultz;
Page 143
24	correct?
25	A. That's correct.
112
1	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
2	depositions.
3	BY MS. BROWN:
4	Q. During your conversation with Mr. Shultz, you
5	discussed the fact that documents had been subpoenaed
6	related to the university of Florida issue; correct?
7	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
8	depositions.
9	A. That general issue came up, yes. You asked
10	me -- I testified about this in the Koballa extensively.
11	BY MS. BROWN:
12	Q. And you also told us in your Hibner deposition
13	on October 1st, Dr. Kyriakoudes, that in response to
14	Mr. Shultz telling you about the documents being
15	subpoenaed, you did tell Mr. Shultz about the e-mails
16	that we have attached here as Exhibits 9 and 10;
17	correct?
18	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked in prior
19	depositions.
20	A. I think so. Yeah. I mean, I mentioned that in
21	a general way. I didn't go into detail. But I just
22	mentioned that I had those e-mails.
23	BY MS. BROWN:
24	Q. And in your Koballa deposition, before you
25	disclosed Exhibits 9 and 10, you told something
113
1	different about your conversation with Mr. Shultz;
2	correct?
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
4	A. I don't recall what I said. I would have to
5	reflect -- I'm sorry, refresh my memory in the
6	deposition.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. Okay, well, let's do that, if you pull out
9	your Koballa deposition, if you look at page 164, line
10	16 through page 165, line one, you were asked: When did
228388
11	you talk to Matt about it? And again, it being the
12	documents being subpoenaed; correct?
13	A. Yes.
14	Q. He called me this weekend, what did you tell
15	him -- or what did he tell you, I'm sorry? Answer: He
16	said that they had had a hearing on Friday and that
17	certain documents were being subpoenaed from
18	Mr. Proctor. Question: Okay. Did you say anything to
19	Mr. Shultz about that? Answer: I told him that, you
20	know, I don't really have any response. It doesn't
21	involve me. Were those the questions and the answers
22	that were asked and given in your deposition in Koballa
23	on August 24th?
24	A. That's correct. And that's an accurate
25	statement.
114
1	Q. Well, Dr. Kyriakoudes, the answer you gave from
2	line 24 page 164 to line one of page 165, I mean, that
3	wasn't the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
4	truth; correct?
5	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form. Asked and
6	answered. Argumentative.
7	A. No. That's accurate.
8	BY MS. BROWN:
9	Q. Well, you did, in fact, respond to Mr. Shultz;
10	right? You just told us that you told him about your
11	e-mails; correct?
12	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form.
13	A. Right. But I made it clear to him that I had
14	not contacted anyone at the University of Florida.
15	BY MS. BROWN:
16	Q. Right. But that's not my question,
17	Dr. Kyriakoudes. My question to you is, when you were
18	asked at your Koballa deposition whether you said
19	anything to Mr. Shultz in response to his telling you
20	about the subpoenas, you said you didn't really have any
21	response. But, in fact, what you told Mr. Shultz is
22	that you had two e-mails that were directly responsive
23	to the University of Florida issue; correct?
24	A. Well, we're talking --
25	MR. McPHARLlN: Hold on. Objection. All of
Page 147
1	these questions were previously asked in prior
2	depositions. All of them. All about this subject
3	matter.
4	MR. KEANE: And I object to the form of the
5	question.
6	MR. MCPHARLIN: Can we have the question read
7	back, please.
8	(The question was read by the reporter.)
9	A. Right. But what -- what's being referred to in
10	here is the real issue, which was contacts with the
11	university of Florida graduate students, which I had no
12	activity in that area. And that's what I'm referring to
13	here.
14	BY MS. BROWN:
15	Q. At this point in your deposition in Koballa,
16	you had not yet produced your e-mails to defense
17	counsel; correct?
18	A. That's correct.
228388
19	Q. At this point in the deposition, defense
20	counsel had no idea those e-mails even existed; correct?
21	MR. KEANE: Object to the form of the question.
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: Previously asked. Objection.
23	A. Well I, can't speak to the state of mind of
24	your attorneys. So I don't know either way.
25	BY MS. BROWN:
116
1	Q. As far as you know, they didn't know about your
2	e-mails; correct?
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
4	Speculation. Previously discussed.
5	A. Well, I had not yet -- I mean, I had not given
6	up those e-mails. That's true.
7	BY MS. BROWN:
8	Q. And so at the point that you were being
9	questioned about your conversation with Mr. Shultz
10	saying that you told him that you didn't really have a
11	response 'cause it didn't involve you, it wasn't really
12	the whole truth, was it?
228388
13	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Argumentative.
14	A. Yes, it was.
15	BY MS. BROWN:
16	Q. Because, in fact, you are involved. You have
17	two e-mails directly related to these issues involving
18	Dr. Proctor, Professor Smocovitis and the university of
19	Florida; correct?
20	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Argumentative.
21	A. Well, I'm not involved in any of the
22	accusations that -- that your law firm is making related
23	to any untoward or unethical or whatever term one might
24	want to use, contacts with research assistants. Or to
25	put it more accurately, I'm not involved in any activity
117
1	that in any way has impaired the ability of research
2	assistants at the university of Florida to conduct
3	activities for you as you guys do your research in
4	whatever capacity that may or -- may be. And so in that
5	regard, it doesn't involve me.
6	BY MS. BROWN:
7	Q. And at this point in the deposition when you
8	were being questioned by Ms. Lawson and she was asking
9	you about your conversation with Mr. Shultz, you did not
10	disclose to her that one of the things you talked to
11	Mr. Shultz about were the two e-mails you had received
12	from Dr. Proctor; correct?
13	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection.
14	Mischaracterization. Argumentative.
15	A. Well, I said what I said. And that's what I
16	sai d.
17	BY MS. BROWN:
18	Q. And so if you did not disclose to her at that
19	point in response to that question, that part of what
20	you discussed with Mr. Shultz were the e-mails you had
21	received to Dr. Proctor related to this matter, that
22	would not have been the whole truth, was it?
23	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection.
24	Mischaracterization. Asked and answered.
25	Argumentative.
1	A. No. I gave an accurate accounting of -- I gave
2	an accurate accounting. That's -- that's correct.
3	BY MS. BROWN:
4	Q. By leaving out the fact that you had discussed
5	those e-mails -- e-mails with Mr. Shultz, you believe
6	that was an accurate accounting of your conversation
7	with Mr. Shultz?
8	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection. Argumentative.
9	Asked and answered. Mischaracterization of the
10	deposition testimony.
11	A. At the time as you were asking me these
12	questions -- not you, but the attorney that was asking
13	me these questions -- this is accurate. And I explained
14	why it was accurate just a moment ago. I mean, you can
15	keep asking me over and over again, but I refer to my
16	prior answer, which was, that didn't involve me in the
17	sense that I did not conduct any of these actions for
18	which; one, I don't know that anything actually
19	happened. And; two, for which you have made accusations
20	relating to interference with graduate students at the
228388
21	University of Florida.
22	BY MS. BROWN:
23	Q. You were asked by Ms. Lawson: Did you say
24	anything to Mr. Shultz about that, that being certain
25	documents being subpoenaed for Mr. Proctor? And you
119
1	said: I told them that, you know, I don't really have
2	any response. It doesn't involve me. Correct?
3	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection.
4	Mischaracterization. Asked and answered.
5	BY MS. BROWN:
6	Q. is that what -- is that how that reads?
7	A. You read it correctly.
8	Q. And nowhere in here did you say: And I also
9	said that I received two e-mails from Mr. Proctor that
10	relate directly to these issues; is that correct?
11	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Argumentative. A
12	mischaracterization of the deposition testimony.
13	A. Well, I would -- I would -- I mean, there's
14	a -- that's a loaded question, it is true that I didn't
15	identify these e-mails. But in my mind, as I read this
16	text, it seems what doesn't involve me refers to
17	anything at the university actually happening at the
18	University of Florida, any act on my part. So that's
19	how I understood it. And that's how I answered it.
20	Q. And that wasn't the whole truth, was it, as it
21	relates to your conversation with Mr. Schultz?
22	MR. KEANE: At this point, you've asked that
23	question five times.
24	MS. BROWN: He hasn't answered it.
25	MR. KEANE: That is enough. That is enough.
120
1	Move on.
2	MS. BROWN: Are you instructing him not to
3	answer the question?
4	MR. KEANE: I'm telling you to -- you know, we
5	gave you this extra time and you're doing exactly
6	what you were doing before. You're re-plowing old
7	ground, as you used the term. You're asking
8	questions that have been asked. And that's enough.
Page 154
9	And you're doing it repeatedly. He gave you his
10	answer. You may not like it. Move on.
11	MS. BROWN: Well, I will take that as an
12	instruction not to answer and we'll move to the next
13	question.
14	MR. KEANE: You could take it any way you like.
15	I'm asking you to move on.
16	BY MS. BROWN:
17	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, at any time before, on, or
18	after August 22nd, did you provide copies of Exhibits 9
19	and 10, the e-mails from Dr. Proctor to you, to
20	Mr. Shultz or any other plaintiff's counsel involved in
21	Engle Progeny litigation?
22	MR. McPHARLlN: Previously asked in prior
23	depositions, just so it's clear.
24	A. That was a valid form. Could you ask it or
25	maybe read it back to me, please. I just -- I just want
1	to have it -Page 155
2	BY MS. BROWN:
3	Q. Let me shorten it up a little bit so it's
4	easier.
5	A. Okay.
6	Q. We talked about -- you had this conversation
7	with Mr. Shultz on August 22nd; correct?
8	A. Yes.
9	Q. At any time before that date, on that date or
10	after that date, did you give copies of these e-mails,
11	Exhibits 9 and 10, to any plaintiff's counsel involved
12	in the Engle Progeny litigation?
13	MR. mcpharlin: That's been asked in prior
14	depositions. Hold on, Professor. Asked in prior
15	depositions unquestionably. But go ahead. She
16	knows it.
17	A. I believe that -- well, after I gave it to
18	Mr. Henk, maybe sometime after that I -- I think I got
19	an e-mail from somebody asking me for the documents that
20	I had delivered at -- at the deposition.
21	BY MS. BROWN:
22	Q. who contacted you and asked for the e-mails
228388
23	that you produced at your Koballa deposition?
24	A. I'm not recalling, but I seem to recall
25	forwarding it to somebody. It might have been Mr. Ogle,
122
1	but I can 11 recal1.
2	Q. And that somebody was a plaintiff's counsel in
3	the Engle Progeny litigation?
4	A. Well, Mr. Ogle was the person at this
5	particular deposition. But of course that had already
6	been given to you. You, meaning, the defense attorneys.
7	Q. And the production of those e-mails at the
8	Koballa deposition was the first time you had provided
9	copies of those e-mails to anyone; is that correct?
10	A. Yes. That's correct.
11	MR. McPharlin: Objection to form. Asked and
12	answered.
13	BY MS. BROWN:
14	Q. When Mr. Shultz was talking to you on
15	August 22nd, did he ask you to forward him copies of
16	those e-mails?
17	A. NO.
18	Q. Did you, during that conversation, volunteer to
19	send him copies of those e-mails?
20	A. No.
21	Q. At any point in time before May 23, 2009, had
22	you ever communicated with Dr. Proctor in any way about
23	the use of research assistants by any expert
24	associated -- or working on tobacco litigation?
25	A. Me making an overture or me myself sending a
123
1	communication as distinct from the Exhibit No. 9 which
2	I've received?
3	Q. Right. Prior to May 23rd when you got that
4	e-mail, had you ever communicated in any way with
5	Dr. Proctor about the use of research assistants by
6	experts retained by cigarette manufacturers in
7	litigation?
8	A. I had not communicated with him about -- about
9	anything at the University of Florida before that date.
10	Of course we had talked about expert witnesses generally
Page 158
11	as part of our research, you know, in the published
12	articles that we have. But, no, nothing related to the
13	University of Florida.
14	Q. Okay. Putting aside the University of Florida,
15	have you had any discussions with Dr. Proctor, either
16	before you received that e-mail on May 23rd or after,
17	about the use of research assistants by any expert
18	retained in tobacco litigation?
19	A. I'm sorry, research assistants --
20	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection. That is a compound
21	question. So at least half of it's already been
22	asked. She's referring to after the first e-mail,
23	the May 23rd e-mail; right? Why don't you break it
24	up.
25	BY MS. BROWN:
124
1	Q. I will break it into two questions. Let's go
2	before.
3	A. And it's just a lot to follow. I mean, I'm
228388
4	trying to hang with you. I really am.
5	Q. I appreciate that. Before May 23, 2009 -- and,
6	again, Dr. Kyriakoudes, you understand the significance
7	of that date; correct?
8	A. Right. That's the date of the e-mail he sent
9	me.
10	Q. Okay. So before you received the first e-mail
11	from Dr. Proctor, had you and Dr. Proctor ever discussed
12	the use of research assistants outside the university of
13	Florida employed by defense experts in this litigation?
14	A. No. Never.
15	Q. After receipt of this e-mail on May 23, 2009,
16	did you have any communications with Dr. Proctor -- and
17	when I say any communications, I mean, from you or to
18	you -- related to the use of research assistants by
19	defense experts outside the university of Florida?
20	A. No.
21	Q. And just to make sure, when I previously asked
22	you the question about before you received this e-mail
23	whether you had engaged in any communications, you
24	understand that that means either to Dr. Proctor or from
25	Dr. Proctor; correct?
1	A. That's correct.
2	Q. So you've had zero communications with
3	Dr. Proctor prior to this e-mail about research
4	assistants from any university in the United States?
5	A. Yeah. That's accurate, we focused on the
6	historians.
7	Q. At any point before May 23, 2009, had you
8	communicated with any lawyer -- that means you
9	initiating it or they initiating it -- with any lawyer
10	representing an Engle Progeny plaintiff about the use of
11	research assistants by any expert retained by a
12	cigarette manufacturer in this litigation?
13	A. None whatsoever. No.
14	Q. And that's true of research assistants outside
15	the University of Florida as well as research assistants
16	attending the University of Florida?
17	A. That's true. Yes.
18	Q. Okay. After the date of this e-mail, have you
228388
19	had any conversations with plaintiff's counsel
20	representing an Engle Progeny plaintiff about the use of
21	research assistants by defense experts?
22	A. No.
23	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you could have chosen not to
24	forward the transcript of Dr. Michelle's deposition to
25	Dr. Proctor; correct?
126
1	A. That's true, it was -- you know, it was an
2	affirm -- an act on my part. That's true in theory.
3	Q. I'm sorry, what do you mean in theory?
4	A. Well, I had the choice of either doing it or
5	not doing it.
6	Q. And you had the choice not to do it; correct?
7	A. That's true. Yes.
8	Q. Now, if you had not forwarded that transcript
9	to Dr. Proctor, he might not have made contact with
10	Professor Smocovitis at the university of Florida about
11	the research assistants employed by Dr. Michel; correct?
12	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
Page 162
13	A. I can't answer that question. I mean, because
14	folded into that question is the implication that merely
15	by forwarding a deposition by a publicly identified
16	expert witness in recorded testimony, that somehow I was
17	responsible for subsequent actions, which I'm not, I
18	can't answer that question. I mean, there's no way for
19	me to provide you an answer to that hypothetical. Too
20	many variables.
21	BY MS. BROWN:
22	Q. Once you received the e-mail from Dr. Proctor
23	on May 23rd, you could have told Dr. Proctor that the
24	work Dr. Michelle's research assistants were doing was
25	not inappropriate; correct?
127
1	A. Well, folded into that question is the
2	assumption that in, what, approximately the half hour
3	between I received that e-mail and send it on, that I
4	had thrown myself into reading that testimony, which I
5	didn't and that I would have pulled that out of there.
6	I didn't even read the testimony. I simply forwarded it
7	on as an example of another historian working as an
8	expert for the tobacco attorneys.
9	Q. I think you misunderstood my question,
10	Dr. Kyriakoudes. My question is, once you received the
11	e-mail from Dr. Proctor on May 23, 2009, you could have,
12	at that point, told Dr. Proctor that you believed what
13	Dr. Michelle's research assistants were doing was not
14	inappropriate; correct?
15	A. I didn't -- well, again, that's assuming that I
16	had completely read and digested this very long multiple
17	exchange, which was forwarded to me, which I did not do.
18	And so I -- you know, the answer would be no. I
19	wouldn't have done that because I didn't know about this
20	research assistant issue.
21	Q. But you could have responded to that e-mail;
22	correct?
23	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection to form. Asked and
24	answered. Speculation.
25	A. Well, I mean, in theory. But the practical
1	matter is, I didn't respond to that e-mail because I
2	didn't see anything in that e-mail that was -- in my
3	very brief review of it, it didn't seem to require any
4	action on my part. So I skipped over it very quickly
5	without digesting its meaning, making, you know --
6	unaware of -- of what it says. So in that regard, no, I
7	wouldn't have responded because it wasn't anything that
8	I considered, thought about so --
9	BY MS. BROWN:
10	Q. Once you had read the e-mails that are attached
11	to this deposition as Exhibits 9 and 10 from
12	Dr. Proctor, you could have communicated to him that you
13	didn't think Dr. Michelle's research assistants were
14	doing anything inappropriate; correct?
15	MR. mcpharlin: Objection to form. Asked and
16	answered.
17	A. Well, I've been asked that question many times.
18	You know, when I really reviewed these e-mails, when I
19	found them in my e-mail box -- I mean, I hold to the
20	position that research assistants are not engaging in
21	any, you know, problem behavior. I mean, I made that
22	clear. But, nor do I see anything in these e-mails that
23	is really any -- any problem. So what you're forgetting
24	is that I was presented with a series of hypothetical
25	situations by Ms. Case, who is in this room here, in the
129
1	Barbanell testimony which is not supported, at least on
2	the basis of these e-mails. So all of this is within
3	the realm of speculation and fantasy.
4	BY MS. BROWN:
5	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, you keep taking us back to the
6	Barbanell deposition. But by the time of your
7	depositions in Koballa and Hibner, you had fully read
8	these e-mails; had you not?
9	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
10	A. In Koballa, yes. When I surrendered them or
11	when I gave them to you in Koballa. Yes.
12	BY MS. BROWN:
13	Q. And Hibner came after Koballa; right?
14	A. Yes.
15	Q. So if you had fully read them by Koballa, you
16	had fully read them by Hibner; correct?
17	A. Yes. But, again, there's no conduct in here
18	described in these e-mails that is any problem. I mean,
19	I don't -- based on this, this does not support -- I
20	mean, I mention Barbanell because that's when it first
21	came up to me. But the things represented to me in
22	Barbanell, you know, are not supported by these e-mails.
23	When I say things, I mean actions of Dr. Proctor.
24	Q. Now, prior to your deposition in the Barbanell
25	case, you could have performed a search of your e-mails
130
1	for e-mails from Dr. Proctor; correct?
2	MR. McPHARLlN: Objection. Speculation.
3	A. In theory I guess I could have. Sure.
4	BY MS. BROWN:
5	Q. And you could have conducted that same search
6	before your Grossman deposition; correct?
7	MR. McPHARLlN: Object to the form.
228388
8	A. I didn't see any point to.
9	BY MS. BROWN:
10	Q. But you could have?
11	A. In theory, yes.
12	MR. MCPHARLIN: Object to the form.
13	BY MS. BROWN:
14	Q. And once you located these three e-mails, the
15	two from Dr. Proctor and the one transmitting
16	Dr. Michelle's transcript to Dr. Proctor, you could have
17	immediately produced those to defendants; correct?
18	MR. mcpharlin: Objection. Asked and answered
19	multiple times in multiple depositions.
20	A. In theory, yes. But I explained that
21	previously.
22	BY MS. BROWN:
23	Q. Now, on October 1, 2009, you ended the
24	deposition of you in the Hibner case; correct?
25	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection to form.
1	A. That's correct. Yes.
2	BY MS. BROWN:
3	Q. And you did so in part to determine whether you
4	should hire your own lawyer; correct?
5	MR. MCPHARLIN: Objection.
6	Mischaracterization. And if we're going to talk
7	about the deposition, I think we should give him the
8	deposition to review, just as we previously
9	established. That would be the fair thing to do.
10	So I'm asking you do that.
11	BY MS. BROWN:
12	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, I am not asking you about your
13	testimony.
14	MR. MCPHARLIN: You sure are.
15	BY MS. BROWN:
16	Q. Do you understand that?
17	MR. MCPHARLIN: Of course you are.
18	BY MS. BROWN:
19	Q. I'm asking you when you ended the deposition in
20	Hibner, were you doing so in part to determine whether
21	you should retain your own lawyer?
22	MR. MCPHARLIN: Are you going to show him the
23	deposition because -- I mean, if you're not, just
24	say I am not going to show it to him. I'm going to
25	conduct it the way I want and I am not going to show
132
1	him the deposition.
2	MS. BROWN: Okay. I am going to conduct it the
3	way I want. I am not going to show him the
4	deposition because I'm not referring to any specific
5	page and line deposition testimony.
6	BY MS. BROWN:
7	Q. Dr. Kyriakoudes, my question is fairly simple.
8	when you ended the deposition in the Hibner case, did
9	you do so in part because you wanted to determine
10	whether you should hire your own attorney?
11	A. I ended it because I was accused of lying by
12	this gentleman sitting here, Mr. Henk. And given the
13	way that that deposition was going, it seemed to be
14	coming -- it seemed to be becoming a very serious
15	affair. And the defense attorney was making -- I'm
16	sorry, let me rephrase that.
Page 170
17	The plaintiff's attorney that was defending the
18	deposition was, I seem to recall -- and this might have
19	been on the record, it might have been off the record --
20	that this was untoward conduct and that this was no way
21	to conduct a deposition. That there were -- that the
22	defense attorneys were treating me very badly, and
23	indeed, the suggestion was unethically. And I was in a
24	very difficult situation. I'm not an attorney. I
25	don't -- you know, I know my area of expertise and my
133
1	professional opinions, but I don't have the picture of
2	the full context of what goes on in a trial, having
3	never sat through one and don't -- I'm not trained in
4	any way to interpret or understand those things. And so
5	I thought the best thing for me to do was to stop it
6	there, particularly after my character had been called
7	into question by Mr. Henk, both me overhearing his
8	conversations with Mr. Quinn, the attorney defending the
9	deposition on behalf of the plaintiff's and then on the
228388
10	record. So I ended it. And that's the answer.
11	MS. BROWN: Move to strike as non responsive.
12	BY MS. BROWN:
13	Q. My question, which is a yes or no question is,
14	did you end it in part because you wanted to determine
15	whether you needed your own lawyer?
16	MR. McPharlin: Objection. Asked and answered.
17	A. Yes. And for the reasons which I'm sorry that
18	you think it's nonresponsive, but for the reasons from
19	which I just outlined in my prior answer.
20	BY MS. BROWN:
21	Q. Now, what did you determine --
22	MR. KEANE: Excuse me, it's 30 minutes. That's
23	it. We're done. I'd just like to observe that
24	largely the 30 minutes was spent on the same stuff.
25	And you need a break before we move to phase two?
