EXAMINATION
BY MR. GEARY:
Q. Good afternoon, Professor Kyriakoudes. How are you today?
A. I'm very well. Thank you.
Q. Professor, my name is Roger Geary from the Shook, Hardy firm, and I'm here for a couple of the defendants in the Kaplan case. And you understand that you're here today because you've been identified as an expert witness for the plaintiff in the Kaplan case; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And that's a case that's pending in Broward County, Florida?
A. That's right.
Q. And it's part of the Engle litigation?
A. That's right.
Q. And Ms. Kaplan is represented by Mr. Todd McPharlin of the Kelley Uustal firm, who's here with us today, correct?
A. That's my understanding, yes.
Q. When were you first contacted to provide
services as an expert in the case by Ms. Kaplan?
A. It's been very recently. About maybe two or three weeks ago, I was called by Mr. McPharlin and asked -- and he asked me if I would serve in this case.
Q. Okay. Did he ask you to do anything in particular?
A. No.
Q. Did he ask you to do anything different than what you've done in terms of preparing yourself to testify in other similar cases?
A. No.
Q. Has Mr. McPharlin or anyone at his firm provided you with any written materials that you have used to help form your opinions in the Kaplan matter?
A. Well, they sent the deposition of -they sent to my home the deposition of Ms. Kaplan
Q. Okay.
A. -- which I brought with me.
Q. So Mr. McPharlin's office has provided you with Ms. Kaplan's deposition?
A. That's correct.
Q. Anything else?
A. That1s all.
Q. And you go by Professor Kyriakoudes instead of doctor, is that -A. I think that's best, yes.
Q. Professor, I've seen you say before in other cases that you are not an historian of the plaintiff; is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. And is that also true in this case?
A. That's correct.
Q. So in this case, your opinions aren't affected by, for example, when Ms. Kaplan was born, when she started smoking cigarettes, what cigarettes she smoked or what type of information she may have received about cigarettes and health effects; is that true?
A. Yes. And just to clarify, those don't change my opinions about what the public knew and understood at different points in historical time. Those pieces of information that you mentioned simply place Ms. Kaplan in essentially -- in historical time generationally. And so it's -you know, I'm aware of what generation she was in, you know, her age and her birth date, but it doesn't affect my fundamental opinion, as you
asked.
Q. Okay. Are your opinions affected by what Ms. Kaplan may have read or may have heard about cigarettes and disease?
A. No, they're not.
Q. And, for example, I wouldn't expect you to, but do you know what sources of information she said she received, what newspapers she read?
A. Well, I reviewed her deposition, and I recall she mentioned that she subscribed to -- I know she mentioned at least getting The New York Times, but also purchasing other newspapers. And she mentioned a couple of other magazines which I'm not pulling up to my recollection right now, but she did mention that briefly.
Q. Now, I know in the past you've explained that you've done a systematic review of The New York Times for purposes of this type of testimony, correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. I take it you haven't done any type of review for purposes of Ms. Kaplan's case in particular; is that true?
A. That's correct.
Q. I may have asked this question, but
other than the deposition of Ms. Kaplan, have you received any other written materials from her lawyers ?
A. No, I haven't. Well, I received the notice for the deposition and that would be it, which I also brought with me.
Q. Have there been any written communications between you and her lawyers about things other than scheduling or about fees?
A. No.
Q. What is your fee arrangement in the Kaplan case?
A. It's the same as in the Ferlanti case.
I charge $400 an hour for testimony.
Q. And how long has that been your rate?
A. It was $375 for a long period of time, and I raised it over the summer to 400 due to simply, you know, the economy.
Q. And how much time have you spent in preparation for the case by Ms. Kaplan in particular?
A. Well, really, all I did was review the deposition that was supplied to me. I probably spent about an hour.
Q. You have not prepared a report for
purposes of the Kaplan case in particular, have you?
A. No, I have not.
Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, I take it that as far as Ms. Kaplan goes, you're not going to testify or give opinions that Ms. Kaplan was harmed because she relied on certain information provided by the tobacco companies or not provided by the tobacco companies; that's true, isn't it? You're not going to speak to her as an individual?
A. Yes. When you phrase it that way, that's right. I will talk about the broader public's knowledge and the public reliance and the public understanding of the risks of smoking at certain points in historical time.
Q. Okay. And I take it you also don't intend to testify as to what she says she knew or what she says she didn't know; that's also true, isn't it?
A. That's right. I'm not her biographer.
Q. And you're not intending to testify that Ms. Kaplan was addicted or what may have been the cause of her condition or her disease; that's true, isn't it?
A. Right. That's not part of my testimony.
Q. Let's see. Professor, what I want to do now is talk to you a little bit about the work that you've done and the opinions that you intend to express. And I'm thinking that maybe the best way to do this is to reference two relatively recent examples of your testimony. So let me see if I have this correct.
In the Engle matter, on November 21, 2008, there was a deposition, a discovery deposition, in what's sometimes referred to as the generic testimony; is that right?
A. Yes. I remember that in New Orleans.
Q. That took place in New Orleans. And in that deposition, you were asked questions by Bill Geraghty and Paul Koethe, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And, again, that was back on November 21 of 2008, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. Let me ask you this: Have you done any work or research relevant to your opinions in Ms. Kaplan's case since the time that deposition was taken?
A. Not -- I mean, I'm always looking at things and always looking at documents, but you
know, I've developed no new areas of expertise. I suspect that's what you're asking about. You know, I've just been plugging along like I always do, you know, just working on my research.
Q. Okay. Have you done any research since that deposition, November 21, 2008, that you intend to rely on in expressing your opinions in Ms. Kaplan's case?
A. No, no. I haven't done anything that would be a reliance issue.
Q. What I want to do now, Professor, is ask you about the opinions that you intend to express at the trial in Ms. Kaplan's case. And one way to do it might be to do this: Following the generic discovery deposition on November 21, 2008, your preservation testimony was taken over a series of days. Actually, it was two days in January, January 26th and January 27th, 2009. Do you recall that?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. And that took place at Stetson University Law School in Tampa; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you were asked questions on behalf of the plaintiffs by Mr. Harry Acosta?
A. That1s right.
Q. And then you were also examined by defense counsel, Bill Geraghty and Paul Koethe, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. In this case, in Ms. Kaplan's case, do you intend to express any opinions beyond those opinions that you gave in that preservation testimony or are any different from the opinions that you gave in that testimony?
A. No, no.
Q. All right. Let's talk about your employment, Professor Kyriakoudes. You're still at the University of South Mississippi?
A. That's right.
Q. And what's your current title now?
A. I am Associate Professor of History and Director of the Center For Oral History and Cultural Heritage.
Q. Have there been any changes in your responsibilities or your title since November of 2008?
A. Same job.
Q. And in connection with your employment at the university, have you — and I may have
already asked this question, but I'll ask it in this way: Has your work at the university involved any type of work or research that you think affects or adds to or supports your opinions that you would express in Ms. Kaplan's case?
A. Well, I mean, to the extent that —
Q. And excuse me. That would be since November of 2008.
A. Oh, let me make sure I understand.
You're meaning like a change in my responsibilities ?
Q. Any change in your responsibilities, any new projects, any new research, any new writings since November of 2008 that would affect or support or influence your opinions in Ms. Kaplan's case?
A. There's been nothing new since that
date.
Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, can you tell us how many times you have testified in the courtroom against tobacco companies as part of your work as an historian?
A. Not including depositions?
Q. Correct. This would be in the courtroom.
A. I'd have to look at my CV and count it up. Give me a moment to do that or if you've got that with you, I --
Q. I'll rely on you for that one.
A. Fair enough. Sometimes y'all have that ready to go. And this is for you as well. This is my current CV. I keep a track on my CV here somewhere.
MR. McPHARLIN:
Roger, you asked a question a minute ago, and I just want to make sure that we're not -- I'm not hiding the ball. When I threw out opinions and reliance materials, I refer to Ferlanti, Hess. I think he may have been deposed in Sherman, I'm not sure, and the generics.
So I don't want -- you know, I don't have the generic testimony right in front of me, but I don't think that we're hiding the ball if his opinions are going to be consistent with those recent testimonies.
MR. GEARY:
Sure. I understand that. What I'm trying to do is to ask the question in a way that's efficient and accurate for the witness to answer.
MR. McPHARLIN:
Okay.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Professor, let me back up just a little bit, and we'll get to that question about numbers in just a minute. Plaintiff's counsel, Mr. McPharlin, just explained that he is familiar with your testimony in the Ferlanti case, Sherman deposition, the Hess matter, as well as the generic case testimony that I have just described. MR. McPHARLIN:
Right.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Let me ask you this: Was your testimony in the generic preservation testimony, was that any different than your testimony in Hess, Sherman and Ferlanti?
A. No. I think the -- I was asked different kinds of questions by the plaintiffs' attorneys in those two matters, but my opinions -you know, there's been no change in my general opinions. Does that help?
Q. That does help. So the opinions that you intend to express in Kaplan would be the same or at least not beyond the opinions that you
expressed in the generic testimony, which, in your view, would be the same as you've expressed in Ferlanti, Hess and Sherman; did I get that right?
A. Right. If you take those set of cases, it would apply to that set of cases.
Q. Okay.
A. You know, those are the -- on the general broad outlines of my testimony, those cases are fairly accurate representations of the research I've done and the work I've done on these issues.
Q. Now we'll go back to the other question about the number of times you've testified in the courtroom against tobacco companies. Have you -A. I quickly counted up 12 times, you know, so 12. I can't remember if I included the Hess trial on that list.
Q. And in calender 2009, you've testified in the Hess matter and in the Ferlanti matter; is that correct?
A. Yeah, that's right. And I'm looking here and both Ferlanti and Hess are on this, so I think it's 12. That would be the number of times that I've testified on issues related to tobacco in which the defendant was a tobacco manufacturing
company.
Q. Obviously, there are a lot of plaintiffs in the Engle proceedings; you're familiar with that?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know how many times you've been listed on behalf of the plaintiffs in the Engle proceedings as an expert witness?
A. It's over 70, I believe.
Q. Are there cases in the Engle proceedings where you've been approached by plaintiffs' counsel and asked to provide expert witness services where you have not yet been listed?
A. You know, I don't really -- I don't know. I don't keep up with that aspect of the paperwork. And as you know, there's a number of people that are bringing suits against your client and the other industry manufacturers, so I've talked to a lot of attorneys. Some may have listed me; some may not. To be honest with you, I don't keep that straight in my mind.
Q. How many other cases for the Kelley Uustal firm have you been listed in?
A. I don't know. You know, I did one case for them, the Ferlanti case. They've asked me to
do this case. If they want to use me in other cases in which my testimony -- along the lines that I've testified in the past, that's okay with me. So they may have listed me in some other cases. I just don't know. I don't keep up with that.
Q. As far as you know at this point, the only two cases that firm has listed you in are the Ferlanti case and this case; is that right?
A. As far as I know. But, again, I don't keep up with that information. So I'm the wrong person to ask, actually.
Q. You're the only person I get to ask today.
A. I know. I know. And I just want you to be clear that I'm doing my best to answer the questions, but this is an area that I don't -- I mean, I've worked with Mr. McPharlin on the Ferlanti case. And, again, if he thinks that my testimony would be relevant given what I've testified in the past on something that he has scheduled out in the future, you know, he can list me on that. I don't have a problem with that.
Q. Okay. Can you tell me how much you received in terms of compensation for your work in
the Ferlanti case from the Kelley Uustal firm?
A. Yeah. I haven't sat down and added up my hours on that yet, so I don't know.
Q. Do you have an approximate idea?
A. Yeah. It's going to be -- you know, I was there two days testifying. I got there the day before and helped, you know -- well, I was there two days. One day was helping to prepare the visual display of the exhibits on the computer program that they use and going over my testimony with Mr. McPharlin. Then I testified for a day.
So that's two days there. And I haven't added it up. But, you know, since this case actually began some time ago, the deposition for it was originally, I believe, in December of 2007, more or less, around that time, or maybe January of 2008, you know, conversations with them over time and meetings and educating Mr. McPharlin on my testimony.
Q. Do you have an understanding as to how many Engle plaintiffs cases the Kelley Uustal firm might have at this point?
A. No, I don't. I know just from reading the newspaper that there's a certain number of Engle people generally, but I don't know how many
have been assigned to or are represented by the Kelley Uustal firm.
Q. Sitting here right now, do you have an expectation that you will be listed in other cases for the Kelley Uustal firm in the future?
A. Again, I mean, my previous answer would stand, which is if they have a case in which the kind of expertise that I hold and the testimony and opinions which I have testified to, as we've discussed in the beginning of this deposition, is relevant to the case, then I would expect maybe they would use me. But that's really their call, not mine.
Q. Okay. Let's do this -A. And just a little minor -- very minor thing, somehow the "0" has been dropped from my first name in all of this litigation, and I'm known as Luis, which is fine, but just for the record and for accuracy, it's L-o-u-i-s.
Q. We'll consider this an amendment by your delineation, how's that sound?
A. Yeah. But I noticed it was listed that way on some of the official documents and maybe even on one of the folders that's been circulating around here.
Q. You don't want future historians to be confused by that?
A. No.
Q. Professor Kyriakoudes, let me do this: What I have here are three DVDs marked one of three, two of three, three of three, which I got from Mr. James' office with the explanation that his office received them from the offices of plaintiff's counsel on your behalf, and they were described as your reliance -MR. JAMES:
Cal Warriner.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Excuse me, from Mr. Cal Warriner's office, my mistake. And my understanding is that these CDs have lists of your reliance materials. And what I'd like to do maybe during a break, with the court reporter's cooperation, which she said we could do, is maybe have you pop these in her laptop and you just confirm that that's what these are. Does that sound okay to you?
A. That's absolutely fine, yes, happy to do
that.
Q. And we'll mark them as exhibits when we do that exercise.
I think I've read in the past from your testimony that you've done no systematic review of Florida newspapers for purposes of your testimony in the Engle cases; is that right?
A. That's right. I have not looked at Florida papers.
Q. Now, you have looked at The New York Times in a systematic way, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you've looked at popular magazines in a systematic way like Time, Life, News Week, Reader's Digest and others, true?
A. That's correct.
Q. Is there a reason that you have not reviewed Florida newspapers for the same purpose?
A. Well, I relied on The New York Times because The New York Times is the paper of record and is the most comprehensive newspaper. It's the go-to paper for historians when they want to research a national issue. And, you know, my view is this is a national issue. These are products marketed nationally and advertised nationally.
Q. And so what you would expect, then, or what you think is that the coverage of these issues in Florida would be substantially similar
to the coverage that would have been provided in other parts of the country?
A. That's been my -- you know, you're always going to find some minor variation, but that's been my experience. I mean, I've looked at other newspapers in other parts of the country and that's held up.
Q. So we could look at newspapers from other parts of the country and say the same type of coverage would have been provided in Florida in a substantially similar way?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to the form.
A. Yes, generally, from the national perspective of smoking and health, yes. Again, there's always some local variation.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Professor, let me ask you this: Is it your opinion that the tobacco companies concealed certain information from the public back in the '50s, '60s, '70s and going forward, information that was not otherwise available to the public?
A. Yes, that's accurate.
Q. Okay. What information, in your opinion, did the tobacco companies conceal that
was not otherwise available to the public?
A. Well, available to the public means readily available to the public. And in particular, my view is the industry had a responsibility to share with the public what it knew, particularly given that it said it would do so .
They didn't share with the public what they knew about cancer, carcinogens in smoke.
They didn't share what they knew with the public about the addictive qualities of nicotine. They didn't share what they knew about -- excuse me. They didn't share with the public what they knew about filters. They didn't share with the public what they knew about youth initiation of smoking. They didn't even share with the public what they knew about what the public understood about the risks of smoking, something which they expended considerable effort in trying to understand and ascertain.
Q. Okay. Anything else?
A. That's fair enough. That's good.
Q. In your opinion, what was it that the companies understood about cancer and tobacco smoking?
A. Well, say, for example, the R.J.
Reynolds company, you know, had in the early '50s research identifying cancer-causing components in smoke. I mean, I'm not a toxicologist. I don't want to speak outside of my area. But, you know, in terms of their internal memorandum, they discussed that. Philip Morris, American Tobacco, Brown & Williamson have similar documentation that I've seen a little bit later, a few years later. There's lots of discussion about that in their documents.
Q. Okay. Let me ask you this: Would you agree that in the 1950s and in the 1960s, there was information readily available to the public as well as to the scientific community about the chemicals in tobacco smoke that were thought to have the potential to cause cancer; would you agree with that?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to the form.
A. One more time just because I lost you.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Let me start over. Would you agree that back in the 1950s and the 1960s, that there was information available to the public as well as to
the scientific community about the chemical composition of tobacco smoke and about its potential to cause lung cancer?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to the form.
MR. GEARY:
Q. That information was available to the public, wasn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to the form.
A. Well, you've asked a lot in that question, so let me start with the scientific community because you did mention that. I have not reviewed what we could use as a shorthand the state-of-the-art research and don't make claims about what scientists knew and what the state of science was on these issues. It's just not an area that I've done research in. So I've answered that part of your question.
The second part of your question, which deals with available to the public, I just want to be clear that just because something appears in the footnote of a scientific article that one could technically get if they went to a medical library or some other place, that for my purposes
of the public's understanding of the risks of smoking, I mean, only in the most limited senses, technical, obscure sense is available to the public.
You know, my position is that the industry represented itself as keeping the public's health as of paramount importance, to use the language of the industry itself, and that they had an obligation to share with the public what they knew because they said they would.
Now, having said that -- because you've asked a big question, and it was a complicated question, so I just want to be precise in my answer. Generally, the public did not know these things. And when information came out that there perhaps would be harmful items in cigarettes, the industry made statements and worked hard to persuade people that this was not a danger.
So, you know, that's the best I can do on that. That's my opinion on that, and I've said that many times.
MR. GEARY:
Q. In the 1950s, there were articles published in Reader's Digest and in newspapers which included information about chemicals in
tobacco smoke thought to cause lung cancer, such as benzopyrene; that's true, isn't it?
A. That's true, yes. Reader's Digest would be an example of that.
Q. And so a person in the '50s or '60s who read newspapers and magazines could read about things in tobacco smoke that were thought to cause cancer; that's true, isn't it?
A. Well, let's stick with what the Reader's Digest said about benzopyrene. There's an article from around 1954 — I'm not recalling the exact title, but I do recall that they describe benzopyrene as merely an irritant. And so, you know, you've got to be careful to see what is actually discussed in the articles about these things. But it's true that the chemical benzopyrene is discussed in Reader's Digest.
Q. I'm going to ask, I think, the same question. Let me try this again: A person in the 1950s and '60s reading Reader's Digest, popular magazines and newspapers could have read articles describing the chemical composition of tobacco smoke from the standpoint of carcinogenicity; that's true, isn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to form.
A. Yes. There was a debate in the '50s in the popular press as to whether there were harmful ingredients in tobacco smoke, and sometimes they would actually mention specific chemicals.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Okay. In the 1950s, there were various researchers looking into the question about whether tobacco smoke caused lung cancer, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And Drs. Wynder and Graham, they looked into the issue?
A. Yes, that's correct.
Q. And two other researchers were Dr. Hammond and Dr. Horn with the American Cancer Society; that's true, isn't it?
A. Yes.
Q. And their work was the topic of articles that were published in the popular press about what those researchers were doing and thinking, right?
A. Yes. It was covered. It was an item of news worthiness.
Q. Now, there were also times in the 1950s when some of those researchers expressed doubt
about whether the scientific evidence was sufficient to justify the conclusion that tobacco smoke caused lung cancer; that's true, isn't it?
A. In the popular press?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes, that's true.
Q. There was a time when Dr. Wynder expressed his view that the scientific evidence wasn't sufficient to conclude causation; that's true, isn't it?
A. Are you referring to a specific article?
Q. Well, I'm just asking you: There was a time when he expressed that doubt, wasn't there?
A. He may have -- I'd have to refresh my memory on that, for him in particular. I'd have to just -- I'd have to refresh my memory on that, so I'm not going to argue with you one way or the other on that.
Q. Do you recall a time when Dr. Hammond expressed his personal view that there wasn't enough evidence, at least one point in the '50s, for him to conclude that it had been scientifically proven that tobacco smoke causes lung cancer?
A. Yes. Hammond made that statement,
that1s true.
Q. And Dr. Heller was another researcher at the National Cancer Institute, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And there was a time in the 1950s when he expressed his view that there may not be enough scientific evidence to support a conclusion that tobacco smoke causes lung cancer; that's also correct, isn't it?
A. Right, in the popular press. I just want to keep that --
Q. Sure.
A. Yeah. You could look at the Edward R. Murrow documentary for that. He was on television, the Edward R. Murrow Smoking and Health Documentary.
Q. All right. And that was a part of the debate that you talked about earlier, that discussion?
A. That's right.
Q. And members of the public could read and hear about that debate by reading newspapers and watching things on TV, right?
A. That's correct. Radio as well.
Q. Okay. Don't want to leave out radio.
A. Yeah. It was big. Radio was big in the
1 50s .
Q. Do you have satellite radio?
A. I don't. I want to get it, though. I need to.
Q. All right. Not to reinvent the whole wheel, Professor, but just let me update a couple of things here. In about 1954, there was a Gallup poll which showed that about 90 percent of the respondents were aware that smoking had health risks. That's true, isn't it?
A. No, no. You're not reading the question properly.
Q. What's your memory of the question?
A. Well, the way it goes is -- and there's a poll in January and a follow-up six months later: Have you heard something -- I'm forgetting the exact language, but the question asked, have you heard of the accusation that smoking may be a cause of lung cancer? That was the basic point of that question.
And, again, that's in my reliance documents if you wanted to look up the exact wording of that poll. I'm sure you may have it. Maybe not here with you, but you've seen it. But
keep in mind, it's asking have you heard.
Q. It's a have-you-heard question?
A. Yes. And it measures, in essence, are you aware of the accusation that cigarettes might be a cause of lung cancer. And you're right in the sense that about 90 percent responded, yes.
Q. Had heard of the accusation?
A. That's correct.
Q. Now, Professor, from the standpoint of a historian based on the materials that you've looked at, you would agree that back in the '50s and the '60s there was a high degree of awareness on the part of the public that smoking was a health risk; that's true, isn't it?
A. No. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't agree with that. I would phrase it this way: What people were aware of was that there was a debate that smoking might be harmful. Many people didn't believe it. In fact, in the '50s, the majority of people didn't believe it. So people were aware of the debate. That's a little bit different than how you phrased it.
Q. Well, let me ask it this way: Would you agree that in the '50s and the '60s, there was a high level of public awareness about the potential
for cigarettes to have health risks?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Do you agree with that?
A. No. I don't like that phrasing either. That's not an accurate representation of the evidence.
Q. What's wrong with that?
A. The accurate way to describe it would be that the accusation that cigarettes might be a cause of lung cancer. And in the '50s especially, that's the only real health risk people would read about. There was a high level of awareness that there was a debate as to whether cigarettes were harmful in the area of lung cancer or not.
Whether people believed it or not is another issue.
Q. Back in the 1800s, there was a magazine called Harper's, right?
A. Yes, that's right.
Q. Was that a popular magazine?
A. Yes, it was.
Q. Was that sort of the leading news and current events magazine of the day?
A. Yes. It began in 19 -- I'm sorry -1857 and continued on and went from there.
Q. And is it the case that in about the 1860s, Harper's published an article that referred to smoking and tobacco as a possible cause of cancer?
A. They -- yeah. In 1865, they have an article in which they basically say that -- I've used this in the Ferlanti -- maybe the Ferlanti trial. I can't remember. That, you know, the accusation that cigarettes caused cancer was utterly groundless.
There is some discussion in the 19th Century that tobacco may cause lip cancer. And generally the view was that it was the heat of the pipe that caused the irritation. So, I mean, that would be what we're talking about then. And, of course, this is before the introduction of the machine-made cigarette as well. So you have to keep in mind we're dealing with different forms of tobacco consumption at this time.
Q. When President Grant died, was there a discussion about the potential cause of his death? And let me back up. When President Grant died, do you know what was reported to have been the cause
of his death?
A. Some people said it was his fondness of cigars. His doctor said to the press that it was stress and, you know, the difficult time he had had as president. But, yeah, there was some debate about his fondness for cigars as a possible cause of his death.
Q. Did he have cancer?
A. My understanding is he died of throat cancer.
Q. And there was some speculation that his throat cancer may have been caused by his use of cigars ?
A. Some people said that, yes.
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Going back, way back to the 20th Century, Professor -A. Way back then.
Q. Way back then. In the beginning part of the last century, there was a time when some states banned the sale of tobacco for a period of time; is that right?
A. Yes, that's right.
Q. Do you know how many states did that?
A. Well, to be more accurate, it would be -- it was about 15 states that banned to some degree the sale of cigarettes. You had mentioned tobacco. I'm not aware of chewing tobacco or pipe tobacco being banned. But, yeah, it's about 15 states. I mean, Florida was -- might be the 16th. They also passed some restrictions.
Q. Do you know what the rationale was for states treating cigarettes differently from other forms of tobacco in terms of banning the sale of it?
A. Yes. I mean, the laws largely came about at the behest of the Anti-Cigarette League, which was a principal reform group that sought to limit cigarette consumption. And they saw cigarettes as something that undermined the morals, particularly of young people. They saw it as a gateway drug to alcohol, which the anti-cigarette prohibition movement or the cigarette prohibition movement was really an offshoot of the alcohol prohibition movement.
They saw it as a moral danger. Some people saw it as a health danger. And they logged many accusations that cigarettes, you know, might stunt
one's growth, damage your eyesight for young boys.
Q. It was also thought to be bad from a cardiovascular standpoint in those days, wasn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to the form.
A. In the popular press, I, personally, haven't seen that in my research. It may exist. You know, the anti-cigarette movement was very dogged and earnest. I guess maybe you're thinking of Kellogg, his book Tobaccoism. Maybe I anticipated a question. Seventh-Day Adventists were particularly anti-tobacco for moral reasons and religio-health reasons.
MR. GEARY:
Q. One of the concerns on the part of the anti-tobacco movement at that time was the tendency for cigarettes to become difficult to quit. That was a part of the concern, wasn't it?
A. Yeah. Anti-cigarette activists often -you know, they would point to that. They were particularly afraid that, you know, young boys would smoke and move on to stronger things, what they thought were stronger things like alcohol and to lead to a general pattern of dissolute moral
and physical inebriation.
Q. And one of the concerns, again, was that the use of cigarettes -- it can be hard to quit for some people; that was a part of the anti-tobacco movement, wasn't it?
A. A bit, yeah. I wouldn't call that their major point; but if you dig hard enough, you can find people making that accusation.
Q. And back in the '20s and back in the '30s of the last century, there were articles published by the popular press which sometimes referred to cigarettes as addictive or an addiction; that's true, isn't it?
A. Yes. Sometimes people would use those words. Sometimes they wouldn't. You know, yeah.
I mean, the critics of cigarettes, you know, have been out there. I mean, they -- it's important to keep in mind that the anti-cigarette movement collapses in the 1920s, at precisely the point that cigarette smoking becomes a national pastime.
But, yeah, you can you always find somebody somewhere making that accusation.
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form of the last question.
MR. GEARY:
Q. And back in the 1920s and 1930s, there were some articles in the popular press which talked about nicotine1s role in smoking and reflecting the idea that nicotine was the component of tobacco that caused people to smoke; that's true, isn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
A. Yeah. Occasionally you can find that, that's true. It's not a major part of the appeal of cigarettes. It certainly -- I guess the best way to describe it is as a whisper compared to the general trend towards using cigarettes at this time .
MR. GEARY:
Q. Professor, you're familiar with the term "cancer sticks"?
A. Yes.
Q. And that's a slang term for cigarettes?
A. That's right.
Q. And it's a reflection of the fact that cigarettes have been thought of as a dangerous product?
A. Yeah. I've testified about slang quite a bit. Cancer stick, which is a fairly recent --
is a relatively recent origin in terms of the use of slang terms for cigarettes. Certainly the research I've looked at, it points it as appearing in the late 1950s. But it's an indication that some people have accused cigarettes as being harmful, a cause of cancer.
Q. What's the earliest reference you've seen in the literature to the use of the term "cancer stick"?
A. What I've seen is around 1957 or 1958, and I'm relying upon the Random House Dictionary of Historical Slang. I haven't found an earlier use of it. You may have -- you may find it here possibly earlier, but it certainly seems to have become -- not existed as a part of youth slang -and that's really what you're dealing with with slang; you're dealing mostly with youths -- until that period of time.
Q. One of the Reader's Digest articles that you're familiar with from the '50s is an article entitled Cancer By The Carton?
A. Yes.
Q. And that was published in 1952?
A. Yes.
Q. Going back to 1949, there was a Gallup
poll that found that most respondents had at least heard that cigarettes could be harmful; that's true, isn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection.
A. Yeah. I know there was a poll then.
I'd have to -- and at the break when we go through the reliance documents, I'll be able to find that exact poll question. I'd have to refresh my memory on the full meaning on that. Because I've got some polls from '46 and '49 that are relevant to that issue, so I'd have to -- I'd just have to remind myself of that if that's okay.
MR. GEARY:
Q. If we need to, we will. I'm just trying to reconnect with -A. Yeah. But I know that there were questions then about -- I think the question was is smoking harmful. I'm forgetting the exact number of the respondents on that one.
Q. Let me ask you this: Based on what you've seen, would you agree that most adults in the United States by 1949 had at least heard that cigarettes could be bad for their health; fair statement?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to form.
A. No, that's not a fair statement. I mean, this is before the cancer health issue as an item of news. So, no. In fact, by this point, the vast majority of men were smoking, a significant portion of women, almost -- just under a third, a bit under a third were smoking. No.
If people had heard of it, most of them didn't believe it, and I would base that on behavior.
Q. Professor, if you can recall, about how many articles were published in Reader's Digest in the 1950s on the subject of smoking and disease?
A. Well, I know 36 were published from the '20s, '30s, '40s and '50s to early '60s. In the 1920s, I believe I counted that up and include the exact number in my expert report. It's certainly not going to be larger than 36. And, again, I -and I'm trying to work with you on this. I'm just not remembering the exact number.
Q. In 1950, Reader's Digest published an article about cigarettes called How Harmful Are Cigarettes, and it listed benzopyrene as a potential carcinogen.
A. Yes. We referred to that article
earlier.
Q. That's the one you're talking about?
A. That's right.
Q. Okay.
A. Yeah. I might have said that was '54, but, you know, I don't have those articles in front of me.
Q. The term "nicotine fit," that's another slang phrase, isn't it?
A. Yes.
Q. In terms of American slang, what does that phrase mean, in your view?
A. Well, you know, that's a slang word to describe people who have a fondness for cigarettes.
Q. Because of nicotine?
A. Right. In this case, yes, because of nicotine.
Q. What does the word "fit" mean in terms of that phrase, nicotine fit?
A. Well, that they're uncomfortable because they don't have -- they're uncomfortable.
Q. And what the term suggests is that there was an awareness that nicotine could produce an addictive effect, right?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I don't know if it would be addictive. This would maybe fit in the other category that we discussed earlier, which, you know, some people describe smoking, you know, as a habit.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Let me ask it this way: The word "fit" in nicotine fit refers to the idea that nicotine can be one of the reasons that it can be difficult for some people to quit smoking; fair statement? MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
A. Yeah.
MR. GEARY:
Q. What's the earliest reference to the phrase "nicotine fit" that you've seen in your literature, the literature that you've reviewed?
A. I don't know. I couldn't answer that right now. I'd have to go back and look. That one doesn't appear very often, and so -- I don't know how far back that one goes.
Q. Do you think it goes back to the '40s?
A. Well, I mean, when I say I don't know, I
mean, everything else beyond that would be simply guessing. My first impulse to look at this, and I'd have to confirm it, would be maybe looking at the Gene Tunney article in Reader's Digest where he talks about quitting cigarettes in the '40s.
I'd have to remind myself of that particular article.
Q. Gene Tunney was the boxer?
A. That's right.
Q. Earlier I asked you the question about what did the tobacco companies conceal from the public that was not already known; do you remember that question?
A. Yes.
Q. And one of the things that you said was the companies concealed what they thought about the addictive nature of cigarettes. Did I say that correctly?
A. Yeah. From the documents -- again, I'm not a scientist or a toxicologist, so I'm not going to, you know, opine on the chemistry of all this. But just from the documents I've looked at, that is the case.
Q. Okay. Would you agree, though, that the idea that cigarettes and tobacco could be
addictive was an idea that was in the public domain back in the '40s, '50s and '60s; that's true, isn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
A. I think the idea is that for some people, they saw it as a habit. But most people did not think of it as an addiction, no.
MR. GEARY:
Q. I think you're answering a different question. Let me try to phrase it a little better: The idea, in general, that cigarettes could be addictive was an idea that was in the public domain back in the '40s and '50s; that's true, isn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to form.
A. Well, you can find people discussing that. Whether that was a widely-held view is another matter. But you can find people discussing that, yes, in popular publications.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Now, I think you also said that something else that the companies concealed from the public was their views about cigarette
filters. Is that one of the things that you said?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay.
A. If it isn't, I'll say it. Yes, it's
true .
Q. What did the companies conceal from the public about cigarette filters?
A. Well, put it this way: In terms of the research I've done and the opinions that I hold on this issue is that the industry both expressly and explicitly on some occasions and then implicitly on other occasions put forth filters as a means by which people would smoke safely; that if there was a harm, the filter would protect them. And what isn't shared with the public was the knowledge that the industry had about so-called health cigarettes and the appearance filtration and the illusion of filtration, their view that filters essentially were ineffective.
Q. Would you agree with me that in the '60s and '70s, there were public health researchers who were telling the public that there was no safe cigarette and that filters will not protect the public from the risks of lung cancer; that's true, isn't it?
A. That's true, yes. The public health community, particular at that point, worked very hard to try to inform the public.
Q. Now, I think another thing that you said was that the companies did not reveal to the public their views on youth smoking; is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. I take it that you would agree that the public was well aware since the time that cigarettes were first manufactured and sold that young people could smoke cigarettes, perhaps not legally, but young people could and did smoke cigarettes; you agree with that, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Youth smoking has been a concern for parents, doctors, high school coaches, principals and everyone else connected with youth going back to the time that cigarettes were invented; that's true, isn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
A. Yeah. To varying degrees, yes.
MR. GEARY:
Q. And one of the reasons for the states
banning cigarettes, as some of them did back in the 20s and '30s, was a concern about youth smoking; that's true, isn't it?
A. That's probably the most important.
Q. I think you also said that another thing that the tobacco companies concealed from the public was what the tobacco companies believed the public perceived about cigarettes; is that one of the things that you said?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. Could you explain that for me?
A. Yeah. It's very clear from industry internal research, public opinion research, marketing research, polling research, survey research, first that they were deeply interested in the public's knowledge, understanding and views of the risks of smoking. In fact, much of the best research is industry research on that particular question because they were most clearly interested in that question.
And, you know, what they didn't share with the public was the role that that research played in their marketing of cigarettes and other public statements and the role that their research program, under the TIRC and the CTR, played in
helping maintain a controversy, at least in the public mind, over the truth of the matter that cigarettes are, in fact, very, very harmful to health.
Q. On the marketing issue, what are you basing that opinion on? What documents have you seen that causes you to say that the companies concealed information that drove their marketing plans that the public was unaware of?
A. Well, yeah. And, again, these are in my reliance documents. Philip Morris company had a series of periodic studies conducted by Roper polling organization that investigated public attitude toward smoking and health beginning in '59 and periodically updating that.
There's a mid-1960s document on the importance of a health -- marketing a health cigarette where they discuss the role of health beliefs and developing new products. So, I mean, there's quite a bit of material on this. And then you look at the kinds of low tar, high filtration cigarettes and Light and Ultra Lights that are introduced over time by all of the major manufacturers. So these would all be examples of that.
Q. Are you aware that in the 1950s, public health researchers urged the tobacco companies to reduce tar and nicotine in tobacco smoke by as much as 40 percent?
A. Yeah. Some -- some researchers thought that a safe cigarette could be developed. And there were a lot of ways that people proposed attacking this, and that was one way, was to reduce the amounts of tar.
Q. And back in the 1940s and early 1950s, almost all cigarettes were unfiltered, weren't they?
A. That's correct. At that time, yes.
Q. And beginning sometime in the 1950s, the tobacco companies did sell cigarettes that had much less tar and nicotine in the tobacco smoke than the cigarettes in the '40s and early '50s; that's true, isn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to form.
A. Well, it depends on how you measure it. As measured by the FTC method, they were lower in those constituents that you mentioned. But, of course, you know, the cigarettes, you know, were carefully designed through aeration holes or
aeration slits with, you know, careful studies of how people smoke, where they put their fingers on the cigarette. So the actual level of tar and nicotine ingested by the smoker through devices such as compensation, it's different than the formal FTC method.
Now, having said that, you know, I've never testified about this before, but since you asked me, I thought I'd tell.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Well, I think it touches on what you said about filters. Let me ask you this: Based on what you've seen in your review of information in the popular press as a historian, what you've seen is that over about a 40-year time span beginning in the late 1950s, the amount of tar and nicotine measured by a machine in tobacco smoke declined by about 50 percent over that time span? That's what been reported in the popular press?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
A. Yes. But that's different than what was actually ingested by typical smokers who were using the product. You know, that part's concealed. You know, if you're talking about
concealed knowledge, that part was not shared with the public by the industry.
MR. GEARY:
Q. In the 1960s, were there public health researchers who expressed the view publicly that smokers could compensate in their smoking behavior for reduced tar and nicotine cigarettes by smoking more or smoking in a different way and published those views in the popular press? Do you recall seeing those views?
A. I'm trying to remember now. There may have been something like that. That wouldn't surprise me, you know, here and there. There's not a lot of knowledge in the public about issues like compensation. That's a fairly obscure part of the -- in fact, a very obscure part of the smoking and health debate as it played out in the public.
(Off the record.)
MR. GEARY:
Q. All right. Professor Kyriakoudes, in the context of Ms. Kaplan's case, you don't know what kind of cigarettes she smoked or when she smoked, what she smoked, do you?
A. Well, she reports in the deposition of
smoking actually a large number of different brands, like Camel -- I'd have to go back to the exact part. But early on in there, she mentions a variety of brands. So she seemed to smoke a wide variety of cigarettes. Chesterfield was mentioned.
Q. I'm going to change gears on you. What year did the caution label first go on cigarette packs ?
A. 1965.
Q. And then in 1970, did a different label go on cigarette packs?
A. Yes.
Q. What did the label say in 1970?
A. Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that smoking is hazardous to your health.
Q. And what did the caution label say in, I think it might have been, early '66?
A. Yes. The act was passed in '65, and you're right, mandating that the labels appear the following year. Caution: Smoking may be hazardous to your health.
Q. And do you recall what year the rotating warnings went on?
A. I thought they went on in '85.
Q. And do you know what they said?
A. It's four labels; one about pregnancy, in reference to pregnancy; one in reference to carbon monoxide. Gosh, what was -- I've got a slide with them that I typed up. I'm just not remembering the exact --
Q. The other one was about the risk of lung cancer, emphysema?
A. Yeah. And lung cancer, and then the fourth one being emphysema; is that it?
Q. What's your memory?
A. I remember one referenced pregnancy, one referencing carbon monoxide, lung cancer, and maybe emphysema was a separate one. I can't remember if the lung cancer and emphysema were part of the same. I'd just have to refresh my memory on that.
Q. The labels would be the best source of information on that?
A. That's right. And I don't smoke, so I don't have occasion to read those. Because that's the current regime that cigarettes still operate under in terms of warnings.
Q. Back in the late '50s, the Surgeon
General was a man named Leroy Burney?
A. That1s right.
Q. And in 1957, he took the view that warning labels were not needed because the public was already aware, true?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to the form.
A. Well, yes. He said that we didn't need a warning label. He took the position that the U.S. Public Health Service had informed the public, which is a little bit different, and that's in his testimony at the Blatnik hearings. But you have to understand that, you know, he was not going to stick his neck out. I've written about that in my tobacco control piece.
MR. GEARY:
Q. And Dr. Heller said the same thing, didn't he, that warning labels weren't needed because the public was already aware because of the work done by the public health community, true?
A. Well, the public health community had basically informed the public of what it knew, which in their view meant, you know, we — you know, they had transmitted the information to
state public health agencies. I mean, they're giving the most literal statement about the movement of information from one body to another. You shouldn't confuse it with a comprehensive anti-smoking educational campaign, which would happen much later, or, you know, any research behind that that evaluated in any systematic, social scientific way what the public actually knew and understood about the risks of smoking. Because the U.S. Public Health Service had not done that, so that's important to keep in mind.
Q. But Heller's view in the '50s was that warning labels weren't needed because the public was already aware of the dangers of smoking; that was his view, wasn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to the form.
A. Well, my recollection of Heller was that he was one of the most adamant environmentalists, if you will, who believed environmental concerns, occupational hazards, pollution and others were a cause of lung cancer. So he was actually a critic of the smoking/cancer theory.
I'm not recalling him making a statement about warning labels. I'd have to refresh my
memory on that. I know he testified in the Blatnik hearings as well.
Q. In 1964, the AMA's view that's published in the journal of the AMA was that the health hazards of excessive smoking have been well publicized for more than 10 years and are common knowledge; that was the view expressed by the AMA, true?
A. The Blasingame letter. That's what that letter stated, that's true.
Q. On behalf of the AMA?
A. Yes. It was on behalf of the AMA. There's more to the story, but I'll answer that in the interest of getting done today so you can get home. And you know what my answer is on that. There's no mystery.
Q. Making good progress, Professor.
You're familiar with Dr. Berkson, the statistician at the Mayo Clinic?
A. Yes.
Q. And in 1964, after the Surgeon General's report was published, Dr. Berkson's view was that there still wasn't enough evidence to support the conclusion that tobacco smoke causes lung cancer; that was his view, wasn't it?
A. Yeah. I've read in statements to the press he was one of the critics of the smoking cigarette theory.
Q. And he was a statistician at the Mayo Clinic?
A. That was his -- yeah, that was his position and training. I meant to say smoking-cancer theory earlier.
Q. In the past in your testimony, you referred to the 1964 Surgeon General's report, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you've talked about the fact that in that report, the Surgeon General's report refers to smoking as a habit instead of an addiction?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you've read the report?
A. Yes. I mean, some parts more carefully than others.
Q. Okay. And in that report, the Surgeon General describes nicotine as the component in cigarette smoke that has the potential to cause the habit forming nature of cigarettes; that's true, isn't it?
A. Yeah. That's how they describe it.
Q. In considering whether cigarette smoking was an addiction in 1964, the Surgeon General's report used a definition of addiction that required as one of its components the element of intoxication; that's true, isn't it?
A. I seem to recall that, yeah. That wasn't much discussed in the popular press and in the public pronouncements about smoking. But if you delve into the technical parts of the report, they do discuss that.
Q. And that was one of the reasons that the committee at that time characterized smoking as a habit instead of an addiction; that's true, isn't it?
A. Well, you know, this is really -- we're crossing over into the science of addiction, which is not an area in which I conduct research. You know, as far as the public's understanding of the findings of the Surgeon General's report, it's true that the public, you know, heard that it was a habit from the Surgeon General.
Q. And back in the 1950s and the 1960s, the words "habit and addiction" sometimes were used interchangeably, weren't they?
A. They may have. I mean, you know,
generally I think the popular understanding of addiction in the mind of the public was something that created a physical dependence, I mean, in terms of the public understanding of this. Again, the science is not my area.
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form of the last question. THE WITNESS:
But, you know, as a rule, addiction in the mind of the public means something that creates a physical dependence. You know, something like heroine, your body craves it. And habit is simply something that you do that with will-power could be stopped.
MR. GEARY:
Q. And outside of your scope, perhaps, but you agree that cigarette smoking is something that with will-power can also be stopped? I mean, that's true, isn't it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form of the question.
A. You know, from what I have read -- you know, and this is not an area that I do research, but just in the course of researching cigarettes,
I have had occasion to read, for example, the 1980
Surgeon General's report and have discussed the issue of tobacco addiction with scientists who have researched this on an informal one-on-one.
And it is an extremely difficult addiction to break and, indeed, as the Surgeon General reports in '88, is more addicting than heroine.
Again, that's speaking -- since you asked me as a citizen and as kind of a concerned person, that's not my area of research or expertise or training, that's very hard. That's a very stubborn -- to me, as an average person, I take that to mean something that's extremely hard to break.
MR. GEARY:
Q. In your work and in your research reviewing literature, have you seen statistics which reflect that as many as 50 million Americans have quit smoking? Have you seen those kinds of f igures ?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to the form.
A. Yes. I mean, you know, people do quit. You need a denominator for that numerator to have that number meaningful.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Let me ask you a different question: In your work and in your research, have you seen statistics which reflect that more than half the people who have taken up smoking have quit? Have you seen those kinds of statistics?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
A. Well, I have seen that -- something like that, attempt to quit, that it takes many, many times to quit, and that actually the long-term quit rates are quite small for people who had been long-time smokers.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Okay. Let's see. Professor, what I want to do now is just show you a small handful of articles and ask you a few questions about them.
A. Sure.
MR. GEARY:
So let's mark this one as Exhibit Number
1.
(Exhibit 1 was marked.)
MR. GEARY:
Q. Professor, I'm going to hand you Exhibit Number 1, which is a Reader's Digest article from August of 1938. And in it, there's an article
entitled So You're Going To Stop Smoking. Let me hand that to you and ask you a few questions.
Again, I think earlier you said there were more than 30 articles from Reader's Digest published on the subject of cigarettes and smoking going back to the '20s; is that right?
A. Well, from when the magazine was founded in the 1920s to the 1964 Surgeon General's report. And that's from Reader's Digest. You know, they say so in an article in 1964.
Q. And this article is written by Henry C. Link, who's identified as a Ph.D. Do you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. And he's the Director of the Psychological Service Center of New York City.
A. Yes, and author of The Return to Religion.
Q. Okay. Let me just read the first paragraph. I want to ask you a few questions about this.
The first paragraph says this: Sooner or later, nearly every cigarette smoker discovers that he is not smoking by choice but by habit, and that the habit is probably harmful. So he tries
to break free from it, but finds that he doesn't know how. Sometimes half-heartedly, sometimes earnestly, he wrestles with his addiction, but in vain. His self-control has been perilously undermined by a mere mechanism of habit. And then the quote ends. Did I read that right?
A. You read that correctly.
Q. All right. And in the same paragraph there, we see the author describing cigarettes as both a habit and an addiction and as probably harmful, true?
A. He says that, yeah. And he also describes it as a mere mechanism of habit, yeah.
So he's all over the place.
Q. Back in the 1930s, was there any magazine in the United States that had a greater circulation than Reader's Digest?
A. Reader's Digest was the leading magazine at the time, yes, and notable for its anti-tobacco and anti-cigarette coverage.
Q. Now, the Surgeon General's report was published in January of 1964, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you've done a review of The New York Times, but there's other papers in New York, too,
right, The Post, The Daily News, and The Herald, as a New York newspaper?
A. Yes.
MR. GEARY:
Let's mark this as Exhibit 2.
(Exhibit 2 was marked.)
THE WITNESS:
It would be The Herald Tribune by then.
I believe that they had merged. Is that right?
MR. GEARY:
Q. I'11 go with what you say.
A. Yeah. I'm right about that.
Q. You are right.
A. In the '50s, they merged.
Q. Professor, here's Exhibit Number 2. And the logo up on top is the Sunday Herald Tribune, the New York Newspaper, right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Okay. And the date on there is January 12, 1964; do you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. And the headline says, It's Official -Cigarette Smoking Can Kill You, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And do you see the bullet points down
there underneath the intro?
A. Yes.
Q. I'm going to read that. It says, The main findings are cigarette smoking is the overwhelming cause of lung cancer in men, maybe for women, too; Cigarette smoking should be assumed to be a cause of coronary heart attacks; Cigarette smoking is linked to cancer of the larynx, the esophagus and the bladder; Cigarette smoking is the most important cause of chronic bronchitis; Increases risk of emphysema. And there are others, but did I read those correctly?
A. Well, I mean, in the issue completeness, cigarette smoking has mental health benefits -quoting the report -- the habit originates the search for contentment, unquote, and pipes are safer than cigarettes, but pipes are a cause of lip cancer.
Q. So my question is: Did you and I collectively read those bullet points correctly?
A. Yes.
Q. Well done, Professor.
A. Yes.
Q. The release of the Surgeon General's report, it was a big story across the country,
wasn't it?
A. Oh, yes. It was front page news.
Q. And what was news about it was the Surgeon General had made a finding as to the relationship between tobacco smoke and lung cancer, right?
A. Yes. That was part of it.
Q. And some other findings, too?
A. That's right, as you just read.
Q. And in Los Angeles on the same day, the headline in The Los Angeles Times was Americans Knew Smoking Hazards Long Before Report Was Started. Do you recall that headline?
A. I have looked at the LA Times for that period. Since you've got it, let me look at it.
MR. GEARY:
Sure. Let's just mark this as Exhibit
3 .
(Exhibit 3 was marked.)
MR. GEARY:
Q. And, Professor, Exhibit 3 is from The Los Angeles Times, Sunday, January 12, 1964. And that's an article about the release of the Surgeon General's report, isn't it?
A. Yes.
Q. And the headline there is Americans knew Smoking Hazards Long Before Report Was Started, correct?
A. That's what it says.
Q. And the report that's being referred to is the Surgeon General's report?
A. That's correct.
Q. And the Surgeon General's committee that worked to create that report, that was the committee that was appointed by President Kennedy in, was it, 1962?
A. That's correct.
Q. And the idea there was to resolve the debate that was taking place about cigarettes and lung cancer, right?
A. Yes. Kennedy was asked in a press conference basically -- I mean, he had been lobbied by the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association, but was finally asked at a press conference, and he basically said, to paraphrase, I don't know, I'll form a committee to look into it.
Q. Okay. I think I'm down to about one last topic, and that's your reliance materials and our request that you bring certain documents here
today. Why don't we do this, how about if we mark these DVDs. And then during our break, maybe you can see if these are in your reliance materials, and then we'll go back on the record.
Todd, is that okay?
MR. McPHARLIN:
About him looking at them?
MR. GEARY:
Yeah. Just so that he can see that I have what I think I've got.
MR. McPHARLIN:
Yeah. Just so we're clear, I mean, what we said before, I think it was Thursday or Friday, that his reliance materials are going to be the same as what was produced in the generic depositions, Ferlanti, Hess and Sherman. So I don't know what's on those CDs because I didn't produce them. I just want to make sure that that's what -- the record is clear on that.
MR. GEARY:
And the question here for this witness is, are these his reliance materials for the Kaplan case.
And before we take our break, let's mark this as Exhibit 4. And what we have here is an
e-mail from Mr. McPharlin to Mr. Gordon James, who is here today, dated March 26, 2009. It's regarding your deposition, and it's an e-mail to Mr. James explaining your reliance materials.
(Exhibit 4 was marked.)
(Off the record.)
(Exhibits 5 through 8 were marked.)
MR. GEARY:
Q. Professor, let's do this, we've marked Exhibit 4, which is an e-mail from Mr. McPharlin. I'm going to set that aside for now and we're going to move to Exhibit Number 5, which has been marked. And it's a notice of the taking of your deposition in the Kaplan case and in the Marrazzo case. And it's a notice of taking deposition duces tecum. Let me give you a copy of that.
Todd, do you need a copy?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Thank you.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Professor, let's go to Exhibit A, which is the third page of that exhibit. Do you see that?
A. I do.
Q. And it says, Please produce the
following: Number 1, a hard copy of all documents that you reviewed, prepared, referred to or relied on in order to arrive at your opinions or conclusions concerning the issues involved in these lawsuits. Let me ask you this, first of all: Have you seen this notice before?
A. Yes. It was e-mailed to me.
Q. And what have you brought in response to Request Number 1?
A. I don't have a hard copy of all those documents. I've supplied those to members of your firm very recently in computer format. It's many thousands of pages, so I don't have the ability to print out that much in terms of a hard copy.
Q. Let me identify, for purposes of the next questions, what's been marked as Exhibit 6, 7 and 8. And what they are are DVDs, which, as I understand, were forwarded to Gordon James from plaintiff's counsel, Calvin Warriner, in the Marrazzo case.
Now, let me hand those to you,
Professor. And during the break, have you had a chance to take a look at those DVDs on the court reporter's laptop?
A. Yeah. I reviewed each of the three.
Disk Number 2 was not read by the machine, so its contents are unknown to me, but I looked at Number 1 and Number 3.
Q. Okay. And what's on Number 1?
A. Number 1 has some New York Times documents and other industry documents, but appear to be New York Times documents that I have discovered in the course of my research and other documents.
Q. Okay. Other than newspaper articles and industry documents, are there any other documents on Number 1, the first disk?
A. Well, I just popped it quickly in the machine. I mean, we'd have to look at it. These are not disks that I created, so, you know, I'm not going to -- I'm not going to make a big deal -- I'm not going to authoritatively state -make representations to their comments, having just kind of briefly reviewed them during a short break.
Q. So you don't know who created those disks ?
A. I did not create those disks.
Q. Okay. Let me ask you this: We would like to get your reliance materials in this case,
the Kaplan case, and Mr. James is here for the Marrazzo case. How can we get those materials from you?
A. Well, as I said on the break, I'd be happy to do what I did for your colleague,
Mr. Geraghty, which is to provide you with the electronic files of the material that I've collected in the course of my research in the history of smoking and health.
MR. McPHARLIN:
And I'm not sure -- I mean, we'll have to talk about it, but I'm not sure if we're going to reproduce everything that's been produced in each of these, you know, four different cases that we've discussed, Hess, Sherman, Ferlanti, generic. I understand what Professor Kyriakoudes told you, that we'd be willing to give you that disk, and that's fine. I have no problem with that either, but I don't know that we're going to make that -to repeat or reproduce exactly what's been produced in all those other cases.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Are they the same materials in all those other cases?
A. The set of materials, yeah, have been
the same that I've produced. You know, I've given you guys everything I have just a few months ago,
I mean, you know, a member of your firm working for the same client. So I'm a little -- I mean, I'm happy to help you out in any way, but I'm little surprised that you want again what I've already given you previously.
Q. My problem is I don't know that what your reliance materials are in this case are the same that you relied on in another case. So my mission here today is to find out what you're going to rely on in Kaplan.
Now, if you're telling me that what you're going to rely on in Kaplan is the same as what you gave Mr. Geraghty as part of the generic discovery deposition -- do I have that right?
A. Yes. But also I testified in the Hess case in January — I guess that was in January. Maybe that was in early February -- and the Ferlanti case.
Q. Were your reliance materials the same in those cases as they were in your generic deposition?
A. Pretty much. I mean, there might have been -- I hate to -- you know, it's a lot of
documents as Mr. Koethe informed me at the preservation deposition -- or discovery deposition in November. It was over 30,000 pages, which didn't surprise me, but --
Q. I guess what I'd like to do is this, I feel like I need and I'm am entitled to your reliance materials in the Kaplan case, could you put those on a memory stick or on DVDs and get them to Mr. McPharlin? Would you do that?
A. Yeah. I'd be happy to do that and supply that to you.
MR. GEARY:
And, Counsel, would you provide that to us when you get it?
MR. McPHARLIN:
The materials that he's referring to, sure. But, like I said, you know, he's testified in probably three different forums in the last few months and provided reliance materials on all those different Hess, Sherman, generic depositions, and you guys have all that. So you can't say that you don't have the materials that he's used in those cases.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Are they all the same?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Well, they are what they are. You have
them.
MR. GEARY:
I know they are what they are. I want to know if they're all the same. Because I don't know if what he's relying on here is the same unless he'll tell me they're exactly the same with no additions or subtractions. In that case, then I can go to Mr. Geraghty and say, you know, it's the same. But right now what I'm hearing is primarily the same, you know, and that doesn't, to me, sound like the same.
MR. McPHARLIN:
If you don't mind me saying, I imagine there are some additions. Like in Ferlanti, I know that there are some Chesterfield commercials that were produced in the Ferlanti case that might not have been produced at the generic deposition. You have those. I know that there are -MR. GEARY:
Well, we're not in Ferlanti. I don't know what he's produced in Ferlanti.
MR. McPHARLIN:
Well, the defendants in this case have
them, okay? The defendant on the phone has them. MR. GEARY:
I'm not here for that defendant, okay? MR. McPHARLIN:
I know that.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Can you put on a memory stick or a DVD your reliance materials that you're going to use in this case, Kaplan?
A. Yes, I can do that.
Q. And would you get those to Mr. McPharlin?
A. Yes.
Q. How soon do you think you can do that? A. I can get them to Mr. McPharlin today. MR. GEARY:
Great. And, Mr. McPharlin, could you send those to me when you get them?
MR. JAMES:
And we would request one of those sticks, too, because I assume that's what you're going to say is applicable in the -MR. McPHARLIN:
I'm happy to send them with the caveat that the reliance materials are as we indicated
they were. And I'll send you what he sends me.
But the reliance materials are as I indicated in my e-mail.
MR. JAMES:
I want to make sure we're in on this.
MR. ROSENSTEIN:
Liggett would also request a copy of that, please.
MR. McPHARLIN:
I'll send everybody a copy.
MR. GEARY:
Q. Okay. Professor, sound good to you?
A. I'm happy to do it.
Q. All right. Thank you. Let's take a look at Number 2 on Exhibit A: All exhibits to be used by you as a summary of or in support of your opinions in these cases. Have you brought anything here today in response to that request?
A. No. That would be -- Number 2 would be a subset of Number 1.
Q. Thank you. Number 3 is your complete file in these cases, referring to Kaplan and Marraz zo?
A. Yes. And I did bring that.
Q. And could you just identify what your
complete file consists of?
A. It consists of a cover letter and a two-part deposition pertaining to Ms. Lillian Kaplan, and then stuck at the back of one of the parts of the deposition are the interrogatories.
Q. All right. Can we take a look at the transmittal correspondence you've got there?
A. (Witness complying.)
Q. All right. Professor, one of the pieces of correspondence you just gave me that's a part of your file is a letter to you from Mr. McPharlin which says, regarding Lillian Kaplan. Do you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. Dear Professor Kyriakoudes, Enclosed please find documentation for you review, and then signed Mr. McPharlin. Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes. You read that correctly.
Q. And there's no date on that letter, is there?
A. No, there isn't.
Q. Okay. And what was enclosed as part of that transmission?
A. The items here. And just for efficiency sake, "items here" meaning the --
Q. The two deposition transcripts and interrogatories ?
A. That's right, yes.
MR. GEARY:
Let's mark this.
(Exhibit 9 was marked.)
MR. GEARY:
Q. And, Professor, what's been marked as Exhibit 9 is the correspondence that you just described?
A. That's correct.
(Exhibit 10 was marked.)
MR. GEARY:
We just heard someone join the deposition of Professor Kyriakoudes. Who just joined?
MR. WARRINER:
Cal Warriner.
(Off the record.)
MR. GEARY:
Q. And, Professor, what we're looking at here with Exhibit 10 is a letter to you from the Kelley Uustal firm signed by a Ms. Sankin, who is a legal assistant. Do you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. And it's regarding the Kaplan case, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And it says, Attached is a Notice of Deposition for March 31, and gives the time and place, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And is that the sum and substance of that correspondence?
A. That is correct.
Q. Okay. And have we now covered your file in this case?
MR. JAMES:
I thought we would note the date, March 23, 2009 on Exhibit 10.
MR. GEARY:
That's right.
Q. So have we now covered your file in this case and the Marrazzo case?
A. That's right. And behind that letter was the notice for the deposition.
Q. It attached the notice that we're talking about now?
A. That's right.
Q. Okay. Going back to Exhibit A to the
notice, it asks that you bring copies of any notes that you created as part of these cases. Do you see that?
A. Yes.
Q. And what did you bring in response to
that?
A. I have nothing to bring to that.
Q. And I take it, then, you have no notes that you created as part of the Kaplan case or the Marrazzo case; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. Number 5 asks for certain documents described as not including the transcripts of depositions taken in these cases, but anything else provided to you for review by counsel. And have you done that?
A. I have nothing responsive to that.
Q. Why don't you do this, take a look at Item 6 through 13 and tell me what you brought, if anything, in response to those and tell us if you have anything responsive to those items that you haven't brought. Do you understand my question?
A. Yes, I do. And I will just go down.
Item Number 6 asks for the depositions. I brought the depositions with me. I'd like to get those
back some time so don't mark them because you know what they are. No invoices. I did you not submit an expert report in this case, so there's no draft. I did bring my curriculum vitae and that is also in the folder. So I did bring something responsive to Number 9.
Number 10, I testified about this previously. I have nothing responsive to 10.
Item Number 11, I have supplied this previously and I gave that, for example, to Mr. Geraghty. I can give you an example of that. I tried to print it out this morning and my printer wasn't working, but I have given you guys this previously as well.
Q. Do you recall as part of which deposition you gave that to Mr. Geraghty?
A. That would have been the one on November 21st, and that was in hard copy. It was also provided at previous depositions last fall.
Q. And that was 11?
A. Yeah, that's 11. I have nothing responsive to Number 12, and I have nothing responsive to Item Number 13.
Q. All right. Let's go to the next page and just keep going.
A. Nothing responsive to Number 14. I've
prepared no materials. I have no direct communications with the plaintiffs. I brought the plaintiff's counsel correspondence. I have not discussed anything -- I have nothing responsive to Number 16. I have nothing responsive to Number
17.	I haven't talked with any doctors. Number
18,	I provided on the curriculum vitae a link. I do have something responsive to 18 on my curriculum vitae.
On Page 7 of my curriculum vitae, there is a link, Worldwide Web Internet link to the recording of an interview which I granted in September of 2008, which I was interviewed about my research and tobacco history. And so I considered that link to be responsive and so you can just go to that website and hear it. It's the website of the radio station that interviewed me. Q. Can we mark the CV?
A. Yes.
Q. Thank you very much.
A. The WUNC. I notice it's lacking the date in my CV, but it was at the end of September.
(Exhibit 11 was marked.)
THE WITNESS:
And then continuing, Number 19, which
asks for a list of cases, that is included in my curriculum vitae. And I don't have anything responsive to Number 20.
MR. GEARY:
Q. And for the record, Exhibit Number 11 is the 11-page CV that you've provided?
A. That's correct.
MR. GEARY:
Just to round out the record here, Exhibit 4 is an e-mail from Mr. McPharlin to Gordon James, dated March 26th, containing information about certain reliance materials.
MR. GEARY:
Let's take a short break.
(Off the record.)
MR. GEARY:
Q. Professor, in terms of your fee arrangement, right now you charge by the hour; is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. There was a time when you charged by the
case?
A. No. I've always charged by the hour, although with a per diem if it took a whole day.
Q. I seem to recall you saying something
about there was a time when you charged $5,000 a case, but then you changed that type of arrangement?
A. Yeah. Briefly, I charged $500 an hour, $5,000 a day and -- but there were lots of objections to that, particularly on the part of a gentleman named -- I believe his name was Ted Grossman, so I changed it. I -- you know, I took account of that. Of course, it was an adversarial deposition environment where he made that objection known, but I took that as an opportunity to rethink that and was persuaded to make a change.
So I went to an hourly rate of $375, which seemed to be reasonable, and I've maintained that for many years. I recently raised that $25, just the economy, you know.
Q. How do you keep track of your time?
A. Well, until very recently, I only -- you know, would only have one case at a time, so I'd just kind of keep track in my head. Because generally what I charge for is the time I spend -you know, I fly out, I'm there two days or three days, or whatever it is, and just the time I spend talking with the attorneys on the telephone, you
know, or meeting with them or something like that.
Q. And do you wait until a case is over to send out a bill or do you do it after an event like a deposition or do you wait until trial?
A. It depends. Generally the time period is such that the deposition happens, and then shortly thereafter, there's the trial. And so I just wait until it's all over with and send out the bill.
On occasion when there's been a long period of time, I'll send a bill for when I think I've done a lot of work or I've talked with the attorneys a lot and, you know, will send them a bill, particularly if the trial seems to either be way off in the distance or many of them don't go to trial.
Q. Professor, I think you've explained to us that your billing is something that you keep track of mentally and you don't have any type of written file or database system that keeps track of your time?
A. That's correct.
MR. GEARY:
All right. Professor, I'm here in the Kaplan case and I think I've completed my
questions. Thank you for taking the time and being here today.
EXAMINATION
BY MR. JAMES:
Q. Professor, I think we'll just roll in. I'm Gordon James. I represent R.J. Reynolds, and I'm going to be talking to you about the Marrazzo case.
MR. McPHARLIN:
I'm sorry. I just wanted to mention a couple of things to him. You're not going to ask him anything about Kaplan, then?
MR. JAMES:
I'm just going to confirm that the generic knowledge applies so we don't go back over anything Roger's done. But if you want to cover something now, that's fine.
MR. McPHARLIN:
No, no. I just wanted to just mention a couple of factors to Professor Kyriakoudes because he may be talking about them, so just so you know. MR. JAMES:
Sure .
EXAMINATION
BY MR. McPHARLIN:
Q. It's your understanding that Ms. Kaplan started smoking in approximately 1941, around there?
A. 1941, yes.
Q. And she was around 12 years old?
A. Yes. She was born in 1928.
Q. Did you read in her deposition where she talked about the penny cigarettes that she used to get?
A. At the candy store, yes, which would refer to loose cigarettes.
Q. And that she was a regular smoker by age
17?
A. Yes. Teenage years, yes.
Q. All right. Those are things that you understand and know about her, and you put that in context with your opinions in this case?
A. That's right. This is where, you know, she fits generationally. Born in the late 1920s, in this case, you know, when she started smoking in this case, as a young teenager, how she acquired the cigarettes at that moment in historical time.
MR. McPHARLIN:
All right. Thank you.
BY MR. GEARY:
Q. Professor, your opinions in this case wouldn't change if she started smoking in the '30s or the '50s or the '60s; that's true, isn't it?
A. Well, that's true, in the sense that in the past, I've been asked to describe the development and change of common knowledge out of all of those periods in time. And so simply placing Ms. Kaplan or anyone else in the period is all that's really needed to do, to see where she fits in the big picture.
Q. You just used the phrase "common knowledge." What does that mean to you?
A. That's right. I did use that phrase. I should have said public understanding of the risks of smoking. But I will say what common knowledge means to me. I've described this also in my tobacco control article that came out in December of '06.
Common knowledge is a mutually-acknowledged state of understanding between at least two parties or classes of people. That is the -- the requirements for common knowledge is for something to be -- for people to
know it to be true for it to be held in common; that is, for everybody to know that it is true, and then for everyone else to know that the other agents also know it to be true. And this is the technical definition as reflected in Scholarship, things like in economics. In the economics of information, it comes up in game theory and in philosophy. I describe this in my tobacco control article.
Q. When you talk about the level of public agreement on a particular subject, can you put a percentage on it?
A. Of public understanding, of the knowledge of -- at certain times. It depends on how good the data is at particular times and how we phrase it. But, yeah, I mean, the public knowledge of the risks of smoking changes and develops over time. It's not constant.
Q. Without regard to the issue of public awareness of smoking, just in terms of the common knowledge, does the public have to reach a certain level of agreement on a proposition before there's common knowledge? In other words, must a certain percentage of the public agree to a proposition in order for something to be common knowledge?
A. Well, under my definition, it would, in essence, have to be 100 percent of common knowledge. That's why I use the term public understanding, which -- or public knowledge of the risks of smoking.
Q. Let's assume this: Let's assume that there is a poll taken in the mid 1980s in which 85 percent of the respondents agree that President Reagan was then the president of the United States, and the other 15 percent either don't know or get it wrong, then under your definition, the fact that Reagan was president in those days would not have been an item of common knowledge, correct?
A. Not under the technical definition that common knowledge as is used in the -- you know, among social scientists. It's a very specific technical term. That would be something that would have a high level of public knowledge or public understanding, yes.
Q. Can you identify a textbook in which it states that 100 percent of the public must agree to a proposition before it's considered common knowledge?
A. I discuss this issue in my peer-reviewed
article and I provide a few citations there from Scholarship in terms of the technical definition of common knowledge. What's going on here is -you know, I mean the term, I guess, has a popular or informal use, and I don't use it that way. I use it the way social scientists use it. And, again, I use a different term, public understanding or public knowledge.
Q. I want to go back to my question. Can you point to a textbook which says that 100 percent of the public must agree to a proposition before it's common knowledge?
A. Yes, I can.
Q. What book or books would that be?
A. Well, article -- peer-viewed articles. You can look -- again, I don't have the citations memorized, but I have a footnote in my 2006 tobacco control article, which is listed on my curriculum vitae and which is available at research libraries. And I could get you a copy if you don't have a copy, although I suspect you do, and look at the citations that I have there. If you want, I can — when I refresh my — if you have the article with you, I'll tell you which footnote it is.
Just give me a second here. Okay, yeah. You've highlighted it.
Q. It's not my article.
A. Yeah. Footnote 32. In Footnote 32, yeah, I cite the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Common Knowledge; Heal, Common Knowledge in the Philosophical Quarterly; and an essay by Milgram, an Axiomatic Characterization of Common Knowledge, which is Econometrica, which is a journal on econometric. So Footnote 32.
MR. GEARY:
Let's mark that.
(Exhibit 12 was marked.)
MR. GEARY:
Q. The article that you just referred to has been marked as Exhibit 12, correct?
A. That's right.
Q. And in your article, do you say that it takes 100 percent agreement to a proposition before something can be common knowledge?
A. I don't use the term "100 percent," but I mean, I use the term -- it's a state of a mutually-acknowledged understanding of some fact among some group. A set of individuals must fulfill two conditions to achieve common
knowledge. They must all individually know and understand a fact is true, hence knowledge. I use the term "all."
I mean, you know, the statistician in me says, well, you know, 100 percent, two standard deviations from the norm, 95 percent error of measurement, something like that. But it is a characteristic of mutual knowing and understanding.
So I do say "all" in this. I mean, that's the technical definition of common knowledge. It's really a term that's unsuited to this venue conceptually. And it was wrong of me to use the term. I used it informally because it lacks any precision. That's why I always talk about public understanding or public knowledge.
Q. So are you saying that I can go to those sources that you cite, and in those sources, I will find statements to the effect that there must be 100 percent acceptance of a proposition and agreement to it before it can be common knowledge?
A. No. What they'll do is they'll explain what common knowledge is as a
mutually-acknowledged state of understanding.
That includes all parties. All -- I mean, I don't
recall that they used 100 percent.
Q. Okay. Sitting here today, on what subjects is there 100 percent agreement such that you could say that's common knowledge?
A. I mean, I'm not sure I know what you mean right now.
Q. Do you know of anything, any issue today where there would be 100 percent agreement on on a proposition sufficient to make it common knowledge?
A. We're talking about two different things here. My basic point is common knowledge is not a good term to understand -- to explain public understanding. That's why I use public understanding or public knowledge.
Q. Okay.
A. So you're asking me a question for which I can't give you an answer. Now, if you were to rephrase the question this way: Is there anything to which in survey data you get 100 percent acknowledgment? My answer would be -- you know, on any proposition, my answer would be not that I'm aware of. There's always going to be people that answer differently only because of a certain error of measurement, error of understanding the
question. I mean, in statistics, you know, we don't deal in absolutes. We deal with confidence intervals, and there's always some error involved.
Q. So I take it in terms of expressing your opinions in this case, you don't intend to use the phrase "common knowledge," true?
A. I avoided that phrase, yes. And I misspoke when I used it earlier. I used it informally.
MR. JAMES:
Nothing's informal on a deposition.
THE WITNESS:
That's right. I didn't mean to lead you down a dark hole there. I'm sorry.
MR. GEARY:
I've climbed out of it. Professor, I think I'm done.
MR. JAMES:
Okay. We're going to move on to the Marrazzo case.
MR. GEARY:
And, for the record, I'm not in the Marrazzo case.
(Off the record.)
EXAMINATION
BY MR. JAMES:
Q. Professor, as I said a couple minutes ago, I'm Gordon James. I represent R.J. Reynolds. And as you've been used to in a few other depositions, we've combined two cases. And I'm now going to be asking you questions on Marrazzo,
I guess, specially related to Pasquale Charles Currao. I don't know if I pronounced it right.
I'm not good at pronunciations sometimes.
I guess starting right where Cal just stated, have you brought anything with you related to Marrazzo?
A. No. I have no documents at all related to that case. I've only discussed it on the telephone.
Q. And only with Mr. Warriner?
A. That's right.
Q. Have you ever met Mr. Warriner?
A. I don't think so.
Q. Have you met anyone with his law firm, Searcy, Denney?
A. No. I don't think I have.
Q. I recall in reading one of your earlier depositions you were asked about -- I think it was actually the one in the Hess, et al. cases about
David Sales. You might remember that line of questions. You were asked by different lawyers in Florida whether you had met him?
A. Yeah.
Q. And you said you had no knowledge of
him?
A. Yeah.
Q. And you said you had no knowledge of the Searcy, Denney law firm?
A. Yeah. That would still be true today.
Q. And that was back when you gave that deposition on September 10, 2008?
A. Yes.
Q. So when did Mr. Warriner call you to talk to you and retain you in the Marrazzo case?
A. He called me about a week ago, very recently.
Q. Did you make any notes?
A. No. I just spoke to him on the phone.
Q. And how many times have you spoken to
him?
A. I spoke to him once about a week ago, and then once since then.
Q. And how long was the phone call a week
ago?
A. Maybe 15 minutes, not any longer than that. Very brief.
Q. Is that when you agreed to be retained on the case?
A. Yeah. He introduced himself to me. He told me he had a case and that they were going to combine the depositions, and I said, that's fine.
Q. Did he tell you how he got your name?
A. No, he didn't.
Q. And what was your arrangement? I know you mentioned it earlier, but I didn't make a specific note. How did you tell him you would be compensated for your time?
A. We didn't discuss that, but I think it's well known that my arrangement is $400 an hour for testimony and consultation.
Q. And then what is your per diem? Isn't there a per diem or something for trial?
A. Well, eight times four, so $3,200 a day.
Q. So if you go to trial and spend two days, it's eight times four per day?
A. Per day, yes, or 16 for the total.
Q. So what you're saying is as you understand it, this is pretty common -- speaking in your words, common knowledge along the
plaintiff lawyers doing the Engle cases in Florida. So if you get called on them, you generally agree to -A. Yeah. I have the same fee schedule for everybody.
Q. And I take it you've never turned any of these cases down?
A. Have I turned a case down? Only recently have there been very many of them.
Q. And you've accepted those requests that you get involved?
A. Yes. I explained to the attorneys what my testimony is. Many of them come to it having read prior testimony that I've given, and so they have some familiarity with, you know, the areas that I testify in.
Q. Do you indicate that that is the universe of your testimony and you're not really changing it for different cases?
A. That's correct.
Q. That's your opinion and that's what they will be if they want to use your opinions?
A. That's a very accurate way to describe it, yes. That's exactly what I tell people.
Q. You're not going to go do more work or
try to do other reviews concerning your opinions?
A. No. I mean, I think the area of my expertise is very well known in this venue.
Q. So Mr. Warriner appeared to understand where you were coming from, your role, and the agreement was made that you would take on the Marrazzo case?
A. I told him that, yes, that's correct.
Q. And then it was already pointed out you would have to be prepared to give a deposition in the very near future?
A. Yes. And I had -- in a phone conversation informally before I received the formal notice of the deposition for the Kaplan case, I had agreed to be deposed on this date. I had penciled that in. And so he said it was going to be combined with that, and I said, since I was going to be here anyway, no problem.
Q. And when did he provide you any factual information about the case?
A. Oh, I had not been supplied with any documents from him. So I actually had a phone conversation with him today and I asked him those questions.
Q. Today being March 31, 2009?
A. That's right, yes.
Q. And when was that conversation?
A. It was over lunch, while I was at lunch.
Q. And how long did that conversation last about?
A. About less than 10 minutes.
Q. And what do you know factually about the Marrazzo case?
A. I know that Mr. Currao was born in the late 1920s, began smoking in the early 1940s, grew up in the New York area, although unlike Ms. Kaplan who is a product of the Bronx, I don't know which neighborhood he grew up in.
Q. When did he start smoking?
A. Around 1941 or '42. Early 1940s is my understanding. Again, I haven't reviewed, though, any documents related to that.
Q. So this is what Mr. Warriner told you?
A. Right. And which he represented on the telephone a minute ago.
Q. And do you know anything else factually about Mr. Currao?
A. Well, I know that he passed away.
Q. Okay. Do you know how he died or what he died of?
A. No, I don 11.
Q. Do you know when he died?
A. I've forgotten that. I was told that earlier today, but I --
Q. Do you know how long he smoked?
A. I believe he smoked -- I think he smoked for approximately 50 years, until his passing, but I don't know his quitting history or those things.
Q. Do you know anything about the brands he smoked?
A. I understand that he smoked Camel. He may have smoked other brands.
Q. So as you've already indicated, this is based on this brief conversation earlier today?
A. That's right.
Q. Of which you did not make any notes?
A. No, I didn't. This was literally over lunch.
Q. And so you don't have any file at all on the Currao case?
A. No. This is something that came up quite late, you know. I understood the Kaplan case to be one that I was working on, and then the attorney in the Currao case essentially mentioned that this would happen also at the same time. I
agreed to that.
Q. You were asked earlier about whether you open a billing file, and you indicated you don't. You keep it in your head. I don't know if you're going to be able to continue to do that. Do you?
A. Right. I may have to -- yeah, it's --
Q. But as far as whatever amount of time you've spoken with Mr. Warriner today, will you bill him for that or will that be just initial freebie?
A. Yeah, initial consultation. I mean, I don't think I've spoken to him total time more than 15 minutes over the course of two conversations, maybe 20.
Q. So your billing today would be for the deposition time, basically?
A. For today, yes.
Q. Have you had any conferences with Mr. McPharlin today in preparing to testify?
A. Well, we went to lunch.
Q. So would you be billing him for that or did he pay for lunch?
A. Actually, I took him out. I took him to the Gulfport Yacht Club.
Q. Well, you better bill him for the time
you spent consulting.
A. Yes. I mean, we discussed over lunch the case, so that would be relevant time.
Q. Do you have any other cases with Mr. Warriner1s firm, Searcy, Denney, or have you discussed getting involved in any others?
A. I've not discussed any other cases with Mr. Warriner, so, no.
Q. Do you know how many Engle cases you are involved in?
A. I think between the Levin, Papantonio firm, Mr. Howard Acosta's firm and the other firms I've talked with, it's a fairly large number of cases in which I've agreed for them to list my name on the case.
Q. Now, do they send you a retainer?
A. I do ask for a retainer when someone contacts me and they say, we've got a number of cases and we'd like to discuss testimony, yes, I do do that. Yes.
Q. And how much is your retainer?
A. I ask for $3,200. That covers, you know, the first eight hours of my consultation with them or any work that I do for them.
Q. Now, I take it you have a number of
cases like with the Levin, Papantonio firm?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you take one retainer and that basically gives them access to you for as many cases as they want to plug you into?
A. Yes. I don't take one for each individual case.
Q. Have you gotten any retainer for Mr. Warriner?
A. No. He just called me.
Q. Are you going to bill him for a retainer?
A. We'll see what he wants to do with this case. He expressed to me that there's some things happening in this case that may make it not happen. If I'm going to do something for him and actually be part of the real case, I will bill him, yes.
Q. It sounds like it's not real formal the way you're handling this; you're kind of flexible on how you sign yourself up?
A. I have some flexibility. I mean, I try to be fair, you know. I believe in getting paid for the work that I actually do. I get to — you know, so when there seems to be real work going
on, then I'll ask for a retainer.
Q. And I take it one reason you can do this is because you really don't do any case-specific review and analysis?
A. That's right. I mean, if I was being asked to go and expend a significant amount of my time doing work that I wasn't inclined otherwise to do as part of my normal research, I might have a different attitude, that's true, or a different practice.
Q. Your testimony and opinions is going to be basically the same in every case?
A. It has been. I mean, I really -- I mean, yeah. I mean --
Q. Because that's why we're all here to take your deposition, obviously, is we want to make sure we know what the testimony is on the specific case we're here on. But it sounds like from what I've read of your prior testimony and what you've told us today, that you're going to give the same opinions about those areas that you opine regardless of whether -- who the plaintiff is?
A. That's correct, yes.
Q. So as far as trying to create some
causal connection between what, in this case, Mr. Currao or what Ms. Kaplan or somebody specifically knew in this continuum of history you talk about, you're unable to do that?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
A. And haven't. I mean, if you read my testimony, you know, I think you'll find that any particular plaintiff is -- you know, they're a part of a group, and I talk about groups of people. But I don't testify to what an individual knew or may have known or didn't know. I'm not a biographer.
MR. JAMES:
Q. And I've read some of what you've said, but I haven't met you before or taken your testimony. I have somewhat of a history background myself, and so I'm interested, you didn't really begin studying and drilling down on tobacco until later in your academic career, correct?
A. Well, no. While I was in graduate school, I was very interested in tobacco. In fact, was part of an oral history project and a public policy project called the Future of The
Tobacco South. In fact, interviewed a gentleman by the name of Fred Bond, who was a long-time head of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Board, which was the -- well, the best way to think of it is the principal organization for establishing flue-cured tobacco quotas and price supports under the old price support regime that since has been dismantled.
Q. And this is in North Carolina?
A. It was in North Carolina, yes.
Q. And so is that where you grew up?
A. I've lived a number of places. I was born in New York City. I lived in New York City in the New York City area until I was 15. When I was 15, my parents moved us to Wilmington, North Carolina. And I went to high school in Wilmington, North Carolina. I went to the University at Chapel Hill. And so that's my background, my childhood.
Q. And so your initial review was more on a cultural -- it was a staple product of the state you lived in. You were going to the state university of that state, and you became interested in looking into it?
A. Well, you know, my first book is on
rural life -- or my book is on rural southern life and the transformations. So my interest there was understanding the rural south and the kinds of changes that people undertook.
And in the late '90s, what I was particularly interested in -- or mid '90s, '96,
'97, was the future of tobacco agriculture and what tobacco farmers would do once tobacco agriculture — well, it wasn't going to go away, but the way it was being grown was changing and it was having a very significant impact on rural lifestyles. And I've published on rural economics, the economic history of American rural life extensively.
Q. And your venture into the area that you're now opining in began as an outgrowth of this ?
A. Partly. Also, though -- and I've testified to this, often when I took my position here at the University of South Mississippi, this is --
Q. Which was when, again?
A. I began teaching in the fall of 1997. A local attorney called me and asked me -- was aware that I had had some expertise in tobacco history.
And he had called and asked if I was -- could look into some aspects of the tobacco industry and what was becoming available then, which was something that was very exciting, the tobacco industry records, the documents.
Q. And what year was that, again?
A. I started here in '97. I would have been doing this work in '98, right after Christmas.
Q. Who was that local attorney?
A. A gentleman by the name of Louis Fondren.
Q. So he1s the one that asked you to begin looking historically into these documents that were becoming available?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you started reading them?
A. That's right.
Q. All the various sources, websites, I take it?
A. Well, at that time, they were not available on the web. He gave me a number of large -- a couple of large boxes with the Minnesota trial exhibits, from Minnesota Blue Cross/Blue Shield v. Philip Morris, et al.
Later, my recollection is, either late '99 or 2000, they became available on the web.
Q. Then when did you actually start testifying for money in this tobacco litigation?
A. I was deposed in February of 2000.
MR. McPHARLIN:
Mr. James, are we going to do like a lot of background on this?
MR. JAMES:
No .
MR. McPHARLIN:
Because I could probably testify to this. I've heard the story.
MR. JAMES:
Well, I understand, but I'd like to hear it. I'm just interested in the basis of this.
I'm sure it's been out there, but I have my right to ask it.
MR. McPHARLIN:
Well, I'm not saying you don't. They really covered it at trial pretty well.
MR. JAMES:
Q. And then it's just grown from there?
A. Well, yes. I mean, I agreed -- I've told this story, but I agreed to be deposed or to
take on the Boerner versus Brown & Williamson case. And that was -- I was contacted late in that case, asked to be a rebuttal witness to review the defense documents. I did that, was deposed in that, kept plugging at it on my own. I've maintained the policy of never charging for my research, only for my time testifying and consulting. I kept plugging at it, and then was deposed again in, I think, December of 2002. I testified in a couple of trials in the spring of 2003 .
Q. Have you ever been disqualified?
A. I don't think so, no. I've testified both in state and federal courts in New York, California, Florida, Arkansas.
Q. As far as -- and I think you pretty well answered this, the decedent, the deceased plaintiff, Charles Currao, you've given opinions generally, and I think you've told me you can't really tie these specifically to him, correct?
A. Well, yeah. I'm not going to testify as to what he, as an individual, knew. I mean, he's passed. We can't ask him.
Q. Well, his widow has given a deposition and two daughters have given a deposition.
A. Yeah. I don't have those. I've not reviewed those.
Q. And as far as his life path, as you said, you understood he came from the New York area. I think you said you weren't sure where?
A. Right.
Q. And do you know that he came to Florida at some point?
A. My understanding is he came late in
life .
Q. But you're not sure -A. I'm not exactly sure.
Q. -- what decade or approximately when?
A. No. I haven't reviewed his case the way I've reviewed Ms. Kaplan's life history from her.
Q. Right. But you've given fairly extensive testimony to my colleague, Roger Geary, here. Is that the extent of anything you would be able to offer in the Currao case, the general testimony you've already given?
A. Yes. In this deposition and in my, you know, recent previous cases would be good examples for you to review so that you would become familiar with the scope of my testimony.
Q. So it would be the generic opinions you
have about how knowledge or perception changed over this period of decades going back into the early 1900s up to the present?
A. Yes.
Q. And, again, without repeating all of Roger's questions, you were asked various questions about knowledge or lack of knowledge or information provided by companies or not provided by tobacco companies, and you've been pretty extensive in your responses that you can only basically give the opinions you've previously given and it won't be to the extent of what the individual's knowledge, lack of knowledge or misunderstanding or understanding was?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
A. Right. My testimony has been on the public, some groups of the public, but groups and public knowledge generally, public expectation. MR. JAMES:
Q. Just so I know, what do you mean by "groups"? What groups have you -A. Well, men and women, for example, demographic groups, age groups, younger people versus older people.
Q. Demographic, you mean different parts of the country or different backgrounds or what?
A. Well, demography meaning population-based variables, which would be age, sex, race, for example.
Q. Ethnic background, have any play in
that?
A. I don't really have a lot of data on that, but that would not be a significant variable to me at this point.
Q. Would race be like African Americans versus Asians versus Native Americans versus Caucasians or what do you -- I haven't really seen much about race in your testimony.
A. I haven't given much about race, but those would be groups, yeah. I mean, I've never testified to this, but one of the things that's interesting, you know — and this works in race and residence. One of the groups least likely to smoke in the mid 1950s was rural, farm-dwelling African Americans, for example.
Q. That's just based on your research, I take it?
A. Based on research, yes.
MR. JAMES:
Why don't we take a brief break.
(Off the record.)
MR. JAMES:
Q. I just have a few more. One thing that came up earlier, and I don't believe Cal was overhearing it because he wasn't on yet, but the Exhibits 6, 7 and 8, which are the three disks that were provided which were copies of the disks that I had gotten from Cal Warriner. And your description was -- well, you tell me what your description was of these.
A. Well, I couldn't read the second disk on the computer here. The first disk seemed to have a variety of documents that looked familiar to me that were part of the set that I supplied to, you know, Mr. Geraghty, Mr. Koethe of the Jones Day law firm, to Mr. Matt Schultz of the Levin, Papantonio firm. The third disk had some of the video exhibits that I've put together over the years, but not all of my videos.
Q. Some of those clips that were used, for instance, in Hess?
A. Yes.
Q. Things like that?
A. Yeah, but I have an extensive video
collection which I have supplied, and not all of my materials were on there.
Q. All right. So to cut across that, what we agreed is you're going to do a memory stick?
A. Yeah, or maybe burn it to DVDs. But one way or the other, yeah.
Q. Right. Which to Todd McPharlin will distribute one set to Mr. Geary, one set to me and one set to counsel on behalf of Liggett; that's agreed?
MR. McPHARLIN:
I said I was going to print yours out.
A. Yeah. But keep in mind that -MR. JAMES:
Q. That way we can alleviate whatever the confusion is with what we have right here.
A. I mean, I've been asked for the reliance documents in a number of depositions in the fall of '08, and I've testified at three trials since the new year. And so I think my documents are well known and have been widely circulated amongst the variety of attorneys that have been involved in this.
Q. I understand. I think the concern that we both have is to make sure we have truly
captured the universe on the record for the cases we're preparing so that we don't get in and have that was or wasn't there. We want certainty. So if you give this to Mr. McPharlin and it's distributed, then we know we have it. That was the intent with this Exhibits 6, 7 and 8, but it seems like there was some confusion. So we don't want to leave that confusion.
A. Yes. I'm happy to send you those things.
Q. Do you have anything else that you plan to do in Currao?
A. No. I would review the deposition of, in this case, the plaintiff's wife just to, you know, ascertain what was represented to me over the phone, what was, in fact, accurate and knowing for myself, you know. Again, those basic questions of age, generation, initiation of smoking, those issues.
Q. And from reading your testimony, I'm not sure -- it must have been in Hess either in the deposition or the trial, when is it you're saying you don't like to use the word common knowledge, the awareness was, in your view, clear?
A. Well, yeah, my testimony -- here's my
testimony on that very briefly: On the issue of lung cancer -- because, you know, there's many risks to smoking and you have to look at each one of them individually.
On the issue of lung cancer, most people -- while people were aware of the accusation, most didn't believe it, particularly among smokers until the 1970s. In the 1970s, particularly the mid to late '70s, the turn towards greater numbers of the general public, but in particular smokers knowing and understanding that smoking causes lung cancer and -- increasing.
Q. Is that somewhat supported by the -because all of this is based on data, correct; you're reviewing data? It's not personal knowledge; it's all data review?
A. That's right.
Q. Is that because of increased numbers of people quitting?
A. Actually, I look at survey research both conducted by polling organizations like Gallup, marketing and public opinion organizations, Roper, industry polls, public polls, the adult use of tobacco survey and other public health conducted polls.
Q. What I'm simply asking is: One of the criteria from your various sources that supports your reaching this conclusion from all this data you reviewed, the number of the increase in people quitting?
MR. McPHARLIN:
Objection to the form.
A. No. I don't really see -- no. That's a relatively minor part of it.
MR. JAMES:
Q. Are there statistics on that?
A. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Q. All right. Well, let me let you finish. I interrupted you. You were talking about that. What else? You said there were many different factors, and you had just talked about lung cancer. You were going to give me the short version, I think, since Todd's probably heard it before, but I haven't.
A. Yes. I'm famous for not being able to give the short version of anything.
Q. Well, you're a historian.
A. That's right. In fact, I remember Mr. Geraghty mentioned I was loquacious, using that very term.
Well, for example, public knowledge of the addictive qualities in nicotine significantly trails that of the knowledge of lung cancer risks. Other risks of smoking --
Q. Well, when does it get to the level where, in your belief, your opinion, let me say that it's more known to an extent that it's clear? MR. McPHARLIN:
Object to the form.
MR. JAMES:
Q. I think you said late '70s on lung cancer?
A. That's a turning point, yes.
Q. Okay. Well, I'd just like to get your criteria, the short version.
A. I think particularly among young people today, even today, that there still isn't a good understanding of the addictive qualities of smoking. That's a big -- that's a gap area. Certainly the -- at least the survey data I've looked at, knowledge of addiction significantly trails knowledge of lung cancer. And that's really a reflection of the news coverage because lung cancer is an issue that is widely discussed in the press. Addiction is not a big part of the
tobacco health debate really until much later.
Q. When, though, on addiction? What time frame are you talking about?
A. Well, addiction becomes a big issue really in the 1980s, especially in the wake of the '88 Surgeon General's report. You know, and the fact that in '64, the Surgeon General was interested in issue of lung cancer and other cancers. And only 24 years later did they identify addiction as an issue of sufficient concern. But that exemplifies the disparity in knowledge.
But, you know, taking the early 1980s, the public's knowledge of the overall risks of smoking, if you were to take smoking as just simply a hazard to health, it still was significantly less than what public health authorities thought that smoking was. I mean, we have good comparative data on this. You know, there's a very good 1982 poll by the Harris polling organization that asks a set of public health and medical professionals, you know, of various health-related activities which is the most dangerous to health, and almost to the last person, they identify smoking as the significant
danger. But when asked of a random sample of the general population, it comes in at Number 10 behind a host of other activities, which public health officials don't see nearly as dangerous as smoking.
So that's an example. Even in the early 1980s, the public knowledge of the risks of smoking really lagged what the public health community understood.
Q. Well, I'm sure we're now well into areas that you've probably clearly testified on in your prior testimony?
A. Yes. This is an exhibit I've used many times -- or an example I've used many times.
MR. JAMES:
Well, I think at this point, we've probably covered — since you've given us the incorporation by reference of your prior testimony and we had the benefit of the Kaplan testimony, I really think we've covered everything that I can think of on Currao unless Cal or -- if there are any other questions on the phone.
MR. WARRINER:
No questions from me, Cal.
MR. JAMES:
And I don't know if Mr. Rosenstein is still there or not.
MR. ROSENSTEIN:
Yes. This is Mike Rosenstein. I'm still here. I have no questions. Thank you. (Deposition concluded at 4:04 p.m.)
